The word “long” refers to the length of the individual discourses, not the collection as a whole, which is in fact the smallest of the five Pali Nikāyas. It is one of the fundamental collections of early Buddhist teachings, depicting the Buddha in a lively range of settings. Compared to other collections it contains more extended narratives in diverse literary styles. Many discourses feature interreligious dialog with brahmins and other non-Buddhists. This collection parallels the Dīrghāgama (DA) of the Dharmaguptaka school, which is the first text in the Taishō edition of the Chinese canon. Several uncollected suttas in Chinese and Sanskrit also belong to this collection. Two-thirds of a Dīrghāgama from the Sarvāstivāda school has been found, but only small portions have been published.",

As the Buddha refused to appoint a successor, the teaching and practice that he laid down become the teacher, and the Saṅgha resolves issues by consensus.",
      "mn109": "On a lovely full moon night, one of the mendicants presents the Buddha with a series of questions that go to the heart of the teaching. But when he hears of the doctrine of not-self, another mendicant is unable to grasp the meaning.",

      "sn": "The “Linked” or “Connected” Discourses (Saṁyutta Nikāya, abbreviated SN) is a collection of over a thousand short discourses in the Pali canon. The word “linked” refers to the fact that the texts are collected and organized by topic. In most cases the organizing principle is a particular theme of Dhamma, for example, the five aggregates, dependent origination, the noble eightfold path, mindfulness meditation, or the four noble truths. This collection contains the most extensive range of texts on these core themes. In other cases chapters are organized according to the person or kind of person who speaks. This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3) as well as a number of miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split between these two collections.",
      "sn-sagathavaggasamyutta": "The “Book With Verses” is the first of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is divided into eleven <i>saṁyuttas</i> or “sections”, with a total of 271 suttas. Most of these are further subdivided into <i>vaggas</i> of ten suttas. The word <i>vagga</i> is thus used of both the major overarching “book” and the subsidiary “chapter”. Each of the suttas in this collection contains verse with a prose narrative structure, although in many cases the prose has been omitted through abbreviation. Where most of the Saṁyutta is organized around subject matter, here the organizational principle is people. Each <i>saṁyutta</i> contains conversation involving the Buddha or his disciples with a different person or kind of person, such as gods, kings, nuns, or brahmins. A typical sutta has a bare narrative framework, where someone comes to the Buddha and utters a verse, and the Buddha replies with a better one. In some cases, notably the Sakkasaṁyutta, the narrative element is developed into a lively exchange. Some of the texts in this collection are well known and widely quoted, such as the invitation of Brahmā or the nun Vajirā’s simile of the person as a chariot. Most of the suttas here have parallels in the Chinese Saṁyukāgama translations; the partial translations SA 2 and SA 3 include Sagāthāvagga material. In addition, many of the verses have parallels elsewhere throughout the Buddhist literature in all languages.",
      "sn1": "The “Linked Discourses on Deities” contains 81 discourses, each one of which depicts the Buddha in conversation with a deity. Typically a deity approaches the Buddha in the monastery at Sāvatthī, illuminating the night with their glory. The deity addresses the Buddha with a question or verse, which may be a praise, a challenge, a riddle, or simply a reflection. The Buddha responds, usually elevating the discourse to a higher plane. As always in Buddhist texts, a deity is not worshiped, but is regarded as a temporary rebirth in a higher plane; the deities learn from the Buddha, not the other way around. In most cases, the narrative framework is slim, and after a while it is dropped entirely, retaining just the verses. There’s no particular theme to the discourses, which range from the simple to the profound.",
      "sn2": "The “Linked Discourses on Gods” contains 30 discourses, each one of which depicts the Buddha in conversation with a god. Here the term <i>devaputta</i> is used, rather than <i>devatā</i> in the previous <i>saṁyutta</i>. The difference is purely nominal and there is no difference in the meaning. The style of discourses is similar to the “Linked Discourses on Deities”, although here there is a greater emphasis on the theme of renunciation. A number of these discourses are regularly recited in modern Theravāda; the Tāyana verses on diligent striving at SN 2.8 are often recited by monastics, while the discourses on the sun and the moon (SN 2.9 and SN 2.10) are popular protection chants, which are also found in Tibetan.",
      "sn3": "The “Linked Discourses with the Kosalan” contains 25 discourses featuring King Pasenadi of Kosala. Pasenadi shines through in the early texts as a complex human figure, one with foibles and foolishness, but with a great devotion and capacity to grow. He appears frequently elsewhere in the suttas; MN 87 tells the story of how Queen Mallikā led him to the Dhamma. Here Mallikā appears again, and in SN 3.8 she shows how she is not afraid to challenge her king. The suttas in this collection typically set the verses in substantive prose narratives, illustrating the struggles and problems that beset a king intent on Dhamma who must nonetheless rule in a world with spies, sacrifices, punishments, wars, and the many temptations of royal life.",
      "sn4": "The “Linked Discourses with Māra” contains 25 discourses featuring Māra, the god of temptation, deceit, and death. In these discourses, Māra typically appears in some terrifying or beguiling form, hoping to disturb the Buddha, or else he challenges the Buddha with a critical verse. Like the previous section, the narrative prose here is substantive. The Buddha recognizes him at once and exposes his deceit in a verse. Māra also appears throughout the next collection, where the nuns take him on. ",
      "sn5": "The “Linked Discourses with Nuns” contains 10 discourses describing occasions when various nuns retreat to a forest for meditation, only to be challenged by Māra. The verses here partly overlap with the Therīgāthā, though there are some that are unique to this context, and we also have a prose narrative to flesh out the context. Māra’s challenges are various; sometimes he is sexist, alleging that women are weak in wisdom (SN 5.2). Several of these short texts are among the most frequently quoted of all the suttas.",
      "sn6": "The “Linked Discourses with Brahmās” contains 15 discourses featuring high brahmanical deities. Most commonly we meet the “Great Brahmā”, regarded as the creator God, but he is merely one of a class of deities, and here we meet several others. Brahmā is depicted here and elsewhere in early Buddhist texts in a respectful way, regarded as a glorious deity reborn in his realm due to powerful good kamma. As here, he frequently acts as a champion for the Buddhist cause. However, like all the gods, he is still under the influence of delusion and has nor escaped rebirth.",
      "sn7": "The “Linked Discourses with Brahmins” contains 22 discourses featuring the Buddha interacting with various members of the brahmanical caste. The brahmins were the custodians of the brahmanical scriptures and traditions, and saw themselves as the spiritual elite of society. A central platform of the Buddha’s ethical teaching was that one’s worth is determined by one’s deeds, not by caste. This was a direct challenge to brahmanical authority, and a number of discourses have an understandably combative air to them. But the brahmins were a diverse community, and it’s just as common to find them relating to the Buddha with respect and gratitude.",
      "sn8": "The “Linked Discourses with Vaṅgīsa” contains 12 discourses with verses spoken by Vaṅgīsa, the most renowned poet of early Buddhism. His verses have a sophistication and personal vulnerability that stamp them as perhaps the most distinctive literary voice of the early texts. Several of these discourses speak of his insecurities and struggles, and how he was helped to overcome them. Others speak from his joyous devotion to the Buddha and the Saṅgha, and of his final triumph.",
      "sn9": "The “Linked Discourses in the Woods” contains 14 discourses with verses telling the experiences of certain monks living the woods. Typically the monk is slack or negligent in some way, and a deity appears to call them out and encourage them to greater diligence.",
      "sn10": "The “Linked Discourses with Spirits” contains 12 discourses with verses telling the encounters between the Buddha—or in one case the monk Anuruddha—and various spirits (<i>yahhka</i>). The spirits were local deities worshiped in ancient India, of a lower order than the gods and Brahmās. While in later forms of Buddhism, such spirits were typically depicted as malevolent or dangerous, in the early texts they are more ambivalent, and many of them are friendly, merely asking Dhamma questions, or extolling Dhamma virtues like mindfulness. That’s not to say they couldn’t be scary, and several discourses reveal a more ferocious aspect. Particularly interesting is the emphasis on the love that the female spirits feel for their children.",
      "sn11": "The “Linked Discourses with Sakka” contains 25 discourses with verses telling stories involving Sakka, the Lord of the Thirty-Three gods. Many of these discourses are relatively lengthy, featuring substantive prose and extended dialogues in verse. Sakka is shown devoted to the Buddha, defending Buddhist virtues of kindness and forgiveness, even in the waging of war with the demons.",
      "sn-nidanavaggasamyutta": "The “Book of Causation” is the second of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with causation through the core Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination. The remaining nine <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.",
      "sn12": "The “Linked Discourses on Causation” is a major collection containing 93 discourses on the core Buddhist teaching of dependent origination. Dependent origination presents a series of conditional links laying bare how suffering originates and how it ends. As such, it is an extended treatment of the second and third noble truths. It integrates psychological and existential aspects of suffering, showing how when bound by attachment we make choices that bind us to transmigrating into future lives. One of the core purposes is to explain how rebirth takes place without having to invoke metaphysical concepts such as a “soul”. The collection begins by defining each of the terms in the standard 12-linked chain, definitions which are assumed to apply throughout. Remaining discourses iterate on this theme, introducing new perspectives and formulations. ",
      "sn13": "The “Linked Discourses on the Breakthrough” contains 11 discourses on the value of realizing the Dhamma. Each discourse features a memorable simile illustrating the truly momentous implications of seeing the four noble truths.",
      "sn14": "The “Linked Discourses on the Elements” contains 39 discourses on various factors classified as “elements” (<i>dhātu</i>). In Buddhism, the term “element” is applied to a range of phenomena, most commonly the main material properties of earth, water, fire and air. Here, however, these four elements play only a small role, and much of the text is devoted to analysis of the perceptual process, and to various character traits. The relation or dependence of elements on each other is a major theme, and this chapter can be seen as an appendix to the chapter on causality.",
      "sn15": "The “Linked Discourses on the Unknowable Beginning” contains 20 discourses that speak of how the ultimate origin of the process of transmigration (<i>saṁsāra</i>) is unknowable. This theme is a direct counter to the hubris of the creation myths found in most religions, which confidently recount events which are in fact permanently hidden from view. The Buddha emphasized that transmigration has been ongoing for a fathomless period of time, illustrating it with a series of powerful similes.",
      "sn16": "The “Linked Discourses with Kassapa” contains 13 discourses featuring one of the most famous of the Buddha’s disciples, the monk Kassapa. Kassapa was an ascetic and diligent practitioner, whose sometimes critical voice was tempered by a love of nature and a tender concern for the lay community. These discourses show his magnificent spiritual attainments, and his overriding concern for the health and longevity of the Buddhist community.",
      "sn17": "The “Linked Discourses on Gains and Honor” contains 43 discourses warning the mendicants of the terrible dangers inherent in material possessions and love of popularity and honors.",
      "sn18": "The “Linked Discourses with Rāhula” contains 22 discourses with the Buddha interrogating his son Rāhula on fundamental doctrines such as the aggregates or sense fields.",
      "sn19": "The “Linked Discourses with Lakkhaṇa” contains 21 discourses with the Buddha featuring the monk Lakkhaṇa (“Mark”). Through his psychic powers he sees beings in various states of torment and distress, and describes them to the Buddha.",
      "sn20": "The “Linked Discourses with Similes” contains 12 discourses with parables or similes illustrating diverse points of the teaching. This chapter highlights the Buddha’s skill in choosing vivid and suitable similes for any occasion.",
      "sn21": "The “Linked Discourses with Monks” contains 12 discourses featuring different monks. Unlike the chapter on nuns, this does not use a consistent template, but depicts a diverse range of scenarios. Each case shows a personal challenge or spiritual triumph, shedding a light on the life of the monks.",
      "sn-khandhavaggasamyutta": "The “Book of the Aggregates” is the third of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of the five aggregates. Of the remaining twelve <i>saṁyuttas</i>, three also take up the theme of the aggregates, while the remainder deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.",
      "sn22": "The “Linked Discourses on the Aggregates” contains 159 discourses on the core doctrinal topic of the five aggregates. This term was introduced in the first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering, and became a foundational teaching in all forms of Buddhism. The basic idea of an “aggregate” is a set or class of phenomena. The five are form (<i>rūpa</i>, i.e. “physical phenomena”, or sometimes simply “body”; note that in Buddhism, <i>rūpa</i> includes all things with material properties such as shape and color, including visions perceived only in the mind), feeling (<i>vedanā</i>, i.e. the pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience), perception (<i>saññā</i>, i.e. the recognition or interpretation of experience, <em>not</em> sense awareness), choices (<i>saṅkhārā</i>, i.e. intention, will, or volition; the choice to perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension), and consciousness (<i>vịññāṇa</i>, i.e. the subjective process of awareness itself). The “aggregates” are the various different phenomena so classified. Almost always, they are referred to as the “aggregates connected with grasping” (<i>upādānakkhandha</i>). The relation between “grasping” and “aggregate” encompasses a number of aspects. The aggregates are the <em>subject</em> of grasping, in that they are the things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent “self”. But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the <em>functional support</em> of grasping, the things that make grasping work. As active participants in the process of grasping, they <em>stimulate</em> grasping to themselves (<i>upādāniya</i>). And finally, they are the <em>product</em> of grasping in the sense that attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this life (<i>upādinna</i>). One of the key functions of the aggregates is to categorize theories of the self. From the discourses, non-Buddhists seem to be familiar with this, yet we cannot identify the aggregates in any pre-Buddhist texts. Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha treated them in his own distinctive way, emphasizing that nothing in the aggregates was a permanent self or soul. In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of death, a guide to the knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight meditation. Many of the short abbreviated texts are built from the same templates employed in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields”.",
      "sn23": "The “Linked Discourses with Rādha” contains 46 discourses with a monk named Rādha on the topic of the five aggregates, and may be considered as an appendix to the previous <i>saṁyutta</i>. ",
      "sn24": "The “Linked Discourses on Views” contains 96 discourses on views, methodically analyzed through the lens of the aggregates. A wide variety of views is assessed, most of which are familiar from elsewhere in the canon, although the first one is unique.",
      "sn25": "The “Linked Discourses on Arrival” is the first of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items (shared also with SN 18 Rāhula) and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the distinction between those who accept the teachings by either faith or intellectual understanding, and those who have realized them for themselves.",
      "sn26": "The “Linked Discourses on Arising” is the second of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the fact that anyone who has these things will suffer.",
      "sn27": "The “Linked Discourses on Corruptions” is the third of three similar sections, each of which takes a set of ten doctrinal items and presents it according to a set pattern. The current chapter focuses on the fact that desire for these things is a corruption of the mind.",
      "sn28": "The “Linked Discourses with Sāriputta” describes Sāriputta’s deep meditation practice, and his conversations with Ānanda, who noticed how radiant and glowing he was. An exception to this pattern is the final sutta, which depicts Sāriputta responding to the challenges of a female wanderer.",
      "sn29": "The “Linked Discourses on Dragons” is the first of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “dragons” or <i>nāgas</i>, a powerful but morally ambiguous serpentine creature of the waterways.",
      "sn30": "The “Linked Discourses on Phoenixes” is the second of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “phoenixes” or <i>supaṇṇas</i>, otherwise known as <i>garuḍa</i>, powerful bird-spirits that are the natural antagonists to the dragons in Indian mythology.",
      "sn31": "The “Linked Discourses on Fairies” is the third of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “fairies” or <i>gandhabbas</i>, who take on a number of benign aspects as minor deities associated with music, childbirth, and as here, plants.",
      "sn32": "The “Linked Discourses on Cloud Gods” is the last of four similar sections dealing with the modes in which various semi-celestial beings may be reborn. The current chapter is on the “cloud gods” or <i>valāhakas</i>, who are deities of the weather controlling the clouds.",
      "sn33": "The “Linked Discourses with Vacchagotta” contains 55 discourses, each with a philosophical inquiry by the wanderer Vacchagotta. These do not exhaust his questions; he also appears in a number of other discourses, notably MN 71–73, where he resolves his doubts and becomes perfected. The current chapter shows him repeatedly raising the question of the ten speculative views, and why they appear. The discourses are entirely formulaic and appear to have been produced from a template. Unusually for a section of this length, it lacks <i>vaggas</i>.",
      "sn34": "The “Linked Discourses on Absorption” (Jhānasaṁyutta) is also known as the “Linked Discourses on Immersion” (Samādhisaṁyutta). It contains 55 discourses dealing with the meditative skills required to perfect absorption. Each discourse describes a meditator who is skilled in some aspects, but not in others, and holds the one skilled in all aspects to be the best.",
      "sn-salayatanavaggasamyutta": "The “Book of the Six Sense Fields” is the fourth of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i>saṁyutta</i>, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of the six sense fields. The second <i>saṁyutta</i> on Feelings also deals with a major doctrinal topic. The remaining eight <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.",
      "sn35": "The number of discourses in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields” varies between editions, mainly due to the way repetitions are counted; SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation in counting 248 discourses. The six sense fields complement the five aggregates as the summary of the noble truth of suffering. Where the aggregates focus on the functional structure of experience as basis for views of self, the emphasis here is on how sense experience stimulates desire. Despite this difference in orientation, the two collections share much in common, and often the exact same template is applied in both cases. The six sense fields are the means through which the world is known, and so each of them has an “inner” and an “outer” aspect—the “eye” and “sights”, etc. Though common, it’s best to avoid thinking of the external sense field as the “object”, since in the suttas they are depicted in relation to the observing mind, and not as independently existing entities. This is straightforward until we come to the last sense, the “mind” and “thoughts” or “mental phenomena”. Just to clear up a possible confusion, this “sixth sense” is simply the mental faculty, and has nothing to do with psychic powers. The outer aspect is <i>dhammā</i>, a term so ambiguous its translation is always difficult. Here it refers to anything that may be known directly by the mind, distinct from the six senses. The most technically correct translation is probably “mental phenomena”, but “thought’ may be used as a more colloquial rendering, so long as it includes ideas, imagination, and so on, not just verbalized cognition.",
      "sn36": "The “Linked Discourses on Feelings” contains 31 discourses on the three kinds of feeling. In Sinhalese-script manuscripts, this is reckoned as the last portion of the section on six sense fields. The term “feelings” renders <i>vedanā</i>, which is the simple affective or hedonic tone of experience as pleasant, painful, and neutral, rather than the complex states we call “emotions”. In the process of experience, feeling emerges from sense contact, and stimulates craving. One of the aims of mental development is to first loosen, then eliminate that second link, so that one still has feelings, but does not experience craving for them. The current collection includes a number of rich and significant discourses on this theme.",
      "sn37": "The “Linked Discourses on Females” contains 34 discourses regarding various qualities of women. Note that the Pali texts use two distinct terms for women, <i>itthī</i> and <i>mātugāma</i>, the latter of which can be translated as “females”. These texts deal with such themes as the kinds of suffering unique to women, why women are reborn in various states, or the qualities that lead to a woman taking charge in her marriage.",
      "sn38": "The “Linked Discourses with Jambukhādaka” contains 16 discourses recording the answers given by Sāriputta to the questions of a wanderer named Jambukhādaka. The questions cover a wide range of themes, from the nature of extinguishment to the difficulty of practicing the Dhamma. This chapter is practically identical to the next, differing only in the name of the wanderer.",
      "sn39": "The “Linked Discourses with Sāmaṇḍaka” contains 16 discourses recording the answers given by Sāriputta to the questions of a wanderer named Sāmaṇḍaka. The questions cover a wide range of themes, from the nature of extinguishment to the difficulty of practicing the Dhamma. This chapter is practically identical to the previous, differing only in the name of the wanderer, and the Pali editions abbreviate, instructing that it is to be expanded.",
      "sn40": "The “Linked Discourses with Moggallāna” contains 11 discourses featuring Moggallāna, one of the chief disciples. He tells the monks of his struggles in meditation, and how he was encouraged by the Buddha. In the last two discourses, he visit the heavens and teaches the gods.",
      "sn41": "The “Linked Discourses with Citta” contains 10 discourses featuring the householder Citta, who was praised by the Buddha as the foremost lay disciple in speaking on the Dhamma. Here he engages in a series of insightful and sharp-witted dialogues with various monks. Citta emerges as a distinctive personality, knowledgeable and witty, curious and incisive, with no lack of humor. But he is more than just a clever speaker, for he also lays claim to exalted meditation and spiritual attainments.",
      "sn42": "The “Linked Discourses with Chiefs” contains 13 discourses featuring various headmen or chiefs. They sometimes ask questions relating to their professions, from entertainers to warriors, while several discourses touch on familiar Dhamma themes, such as overcoming anger, the validity of brahmanical rites, or whether monastics should use money. Some of the chiefs are quite adversarial, aiming to trip up the Buddha in debate, or accusing him of being a magician. In the end, though, the Buddha’s compassionate and measured responses win them over.",
      "sn43": "The “Linked Discourses on the Unconditioned” contains 44 discourses on the theme of the unconditioned, i.e. <i>nibbāna</i> or “extinguishment”. They focus on the various practices that lead to the unconditioned. This chapter includes an extensive range of terms and idioms describing the final goal of Buddhist practice.",
      "sn44": "The “Linked Discourses on the Undeclared” contains 44 discourses on the theme of the ten “undeclared” questions. These are a stock series of metaphysical hypotheses, which the Buddha dismissed as being based on the implicit assumption of a self, and hence as being counterproductive to liberation. The first discourse here features a conversation between King Pasenadi and the nun Khemā on this topic.",
      "sn-mahavaggasamyutta": "The “Great Book” is the last and largest of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It consists of twelve <i>saṁyuttas</i>, almost all of which deal with an aspect of Buddhist practice, or the path. The first of these, indeed, is the “Section on the Path” (<i>Maggasaṁyutta</i>), and in the northern canons the book as a whole is referred to as the “Book of the Path” (<i>Maggavagga</i>). The first seven of the <i>saṁyuttas</i> treat the familiar set of seven groups of factors on Buddhist practice known to the later traditions as the <i>bodhipakkhiyā dhammā</i>, or “qualities leading to awakening”. This book is the primary source for these teachings. Subsequent <i>saṁyuttas</i> deal with the path from different perspectives, while the final two deal with stream-entry and the four noble truths respectively.",
      "sn45": "The “Linked Discourses on the Path” contains 180 discourses on the noble eightfold path, the “middle way” which is the first and most important of all the Buddha’s teachings on the path of spiritual practice. It is mentioned in the first discourse as the fourth noble truth. It begins with “right view” which is initially an accurate conceptual understanding, based on hearing the teachings and reflecting on their meaning. The second factor is right intention, referring to the attitude or motivation that shapes practice. Next come three factors dealing with ethical conduct. And the final three factors directly deal with meditation. Once all these factors are mature, “right immersion” or the four absorptions (<i>jhānas</i>) enables the initial conceptual understanding to ascend to a higher level of insight and letting go. While this and subsequent chapters contains many substantive discourses on this theme, the large number of discourses is mainly attributable to the formulaic “repetition series” which append each chapter.",
      "sn46": "The “Linked Discourses on the Awakening Factors” contains 184 discourses on the seven awakening factors. These are qualities such as mindfulness and investigation which lead the meditator to awakening. The focus here is specifically on meditation, rather than the more holistic approach included in the previous chapter on the Path. Some distinctive features of this collection include the use recitation of the awakening factors in order to inspire those who are sick, and the frequent contrast between the seven awakening factors and the five hindrances.",
      "sn47": "The “Linked Discourses on Mindfulness Meditation” contains 104 discourses on the four kinds of mindfulness meditation (<i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>, otherwise known as the “foundations of mindfulness” or “establishments of mindfulness”). These are the body, feelings, mind, and principles. The last of these is translated in various ways, but a close reading of the texts in this chapter shows that it originally referred to the “principles” of causality underlying the process of meditation itself. These discourses on this fundamental topic are much less known than the longer “Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation” found in versions in MN 10 and DN 22; however, they are historically earlier than that late compilation. Where MN 10 emphasizes insight meditation, in this collection we frequently find mindfulness closely connected to absorption, as it is the factor of the path that leads directly to “right immersion”. Insight is mentioned only rarely. The root meaning of the term mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) is “memory”, and when used in meditation it refers to not “forgetting” one’s meditation, but keeping focus on the breath or other theme of meditation. This collection presents a range of perspectives on mindfulness meditation; one of its most memorable features is a series of similes or parables illustrating the practice. The partner of mindfulness (<i>sati</i>) is “situational awareness” (<i>sampajañña</i>, sometimes rendered as “clear comprehension”), which refers to keeping a broad awareness and understanding especially in daily activities.",
      "sn48": "The “Linked Discourses on the Faculties” contains 178 discourses on various sets of “faculties” (<i>indriya</i>). The “five faculties” of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom are the most natural fit in this context. However the chapter also finds room for discourses on a wider range of 22 faculties, including the six sense faculties, five affective faculties (kinds of feeling), three faculties relating the process of enlightenment, and three concerning biology and gender. This flexible category thus serves as a link between the teachings on wisdom and those on the path.",
      "sn49": "The “Linked Discourses on the Right Efforts” contains 54 discourses, which are, however, a mere instantiation of the standard repetition series as applied to the four right efforts. There are many discourses on right effort throughout the Pali <i>nikāyas</i>, but for some reason the redactors did not collect them here.",
      "sn50": "The “Linked Discourses on the Five Powers” contains 108 discourses, which are, however, a mere instantiation of the standard repetition series as applied to the five powers. These powers are effectively identical with the five faculties, as stated at SN 48.43, being merely distinguished as a different teaching approach. There are several discourses on these qualities found mainly in the Aṅguttara Fives, but for some reason the redactors did not collect them here.",
      "sn51": "The “Linked Discourses on the Bases of Psychic Power” contains 86 discourses dealing with the qualities of enthusiasm or desire for practice, energy, higher consciousness, and inquiry, which are said to lead to the development of various psychic powers. The purpose of Buddhism, of course, is not to develop such powers. But they are a matter of constant interest and intrigue among spiritual practitioners—not just in ancient India—and it seems the Buddha formulated this approach to the path to inspire those interested in them. The emphasis is on the development of deep meditation immersion (<i>samādhi</i>) through applying effort.",
      "sn52": "The “Linked Discourses with Anuruddha” contains 24 discourses with Anuruddha, famous for his powers of clairvoyance, but here revealed as an exponent of mindfulness meditation. It is to mindfulness meditation that he attributes his spiritual attainments, whether psychic powers, absorptions, or awakening. This series of texts can be regarded as a supplement to SN 47.",
      "sn53": "The “Linked Discourses on Absorption” contains 54 discourses on the topic of absorption meditation (<i>jhāna</i>), which however merely apply the standard repetition series to the formula for the four absorptions.",
      "sn54": "The “Linked Discourses on Breath Meditation” contains 20 discourses on breath meditation (<i>ānāpānassati</i>), the most revered form of meditation from early Buddhism until the present day. It was practiced by the Buddha himself. The meditation is taught in a detailed series of sixteen steps. These are partially sequential, but also overlap in some cases. The development of these fulfills all four kinds of mindfulness meditation and the seven factors of awakening. Thus this one form of meditation can lead to awakening; which is not, however, to say that it is invariably the best approach. The Buddha taught many different meditations for a reason; each has its own qualities and benefits. Breath meditation is seen as a peaceful and pleasant meditation which helps still distracting thoughts. It is a simple practice broadly suitable for most meditators, but leading to profound depths.",
      "sn55": "The “Linked Discourses on Stream-Entry” contains 74 discourses on the topic of stream-entry, or more precisely, two sets of four qualities, one of which distinguishes a person as a stream-enterer, and one which help lead to stream-entry. The primary qualities of the first set are faith and ethical conduct. For the second, it is hearing the teaching and practicing accordingly. Note that these sets do not exhaust the qualities of a stream-enterer, many others of which are described elsewhere, but serve to emphasis the crucial role especially of faith.",
      "sn56": "The “Linked Discourses on the Truths” contains 131 discourses on the four noble truths: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. These formed the main subject of the Buddha’s first discourse, which is included here as SN 56.11. The Buddha said that all of his teaching was comprised within the four noble truths. Indeed, the overall structure of the main doctrinal Saṁyuttas can be seen as an expanded example of this: The sections on the Aggregates and the Sense Fields deal with the first noble truth; Dependent Origination deals with the second and third; and the chapters on the Path deal with the final truth. This chapter thus provides an overall perspective on the other teachings, and the chapter occurs at the end just as the realization of the four noble truths emerges from the path.",

These collections organize texts in numbered sets, from one to eleven. Compared to the other <i>nikāyas</i>, they are more oriented to the lay community. The Ekottarikāgama (EA) in Chinese is a highly unusual text, which features a range of variations within itself when it comes even to basic doctrines.

I’ll drive them away, mother,” said the girl, lifting her pestle to the flies which had settled on her mother.

Afterwards he bade his gardener go round with the Brethren and give mangoes and other kinds of fruits to their Reverences. In obedience to orders, the man walked about the grounds with the Brethren, and could tell by a single glance up at the tree what fruit was green, what nearly ripe, and what quite ripe, and so on. And what he said was always found true. So the Brethren came to the Buddha and mentioned how expert the gardener was, and how, whilst himself standing on the ground, he could accurately tell the condition of the hanging fruit. “Brethren,” said the Master, “this gardener is not the only one who has had knowledge of fruits. A like knowledge was shewn by the wise and good of former days also.” And so saying, he told this story of the past.",

Thought the young beginner, “There is a tremendous lot of this Morality; and I shall undoubtedly fail to fulfil all I have vowed. Yet what is the good of being a brother at all, if one cannot keep the rules of Morality? My best course is to go back to the world, take a wife and rear children, living a life of almsgiving and other good works.” So he told his superiors what he thought, saying that he proposed to return to the lower state of a layman, and wished to hand back his bowl and robes. “Well, if it be so with you,” said they, “at least take leave of the Buddha before you go;” and they brought the young man before the Master in the Hall of Truth.",

One day, whilst he was on his round for alms through Savatthi, he espied a woman in brave attire, and, for pleasure’s sake, broke through the higher morality and gazed upon her! Passion was stirred within him, he became even as a fig-tree felled by the axe.

Why have you not let us see you all this long time? At last I have seen you; come, let your mother see you too.” So saying, he took the Master with him to his house; and there the Master sat upon the seat prepared for him, with his disciples around him. Then came the brahmin’s wife, and she too fell at the feet of the Blessed One, crying, “My son, where have you been all this time? Is it not the duty of children to comfort their parents in their old age?” Hereon, she called to her sons and daughters that their brother was come, and made them salute the Buddha.

He is said to have been a youth of a good family in Savatthi; and one day, on his way home from ploughing, he turned in to the monastery. Here he received from the bowl of a certain Elder some dainty fare, rich and sweet, which made him think to himself,—“Day and night I am toiling away with my hands at divers tasks, yet never do I taste food so sweet. I must turn Brother myself!” So he joined the Brotherhood, but after six weeks’ zealous application to high thinking, fell under the dominion of Lusts and off he went. His belly again proving too much for him, back he came to join the Brotherhood once more, and studied the Abhidhamma. In this way, six times he left and came back again; but when for the seventh time he became a Brother, he mastered the whole seven books of the Abhidhamma, and by much chanting of the Doctrine of the Brothers won Discernment and attained to Arahatship.

      "ja71": "“Learn thou from him.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about the Elder named Tissa the Squire’s Son. Tradition says that one day thirty young gentlemen of Savatthi, who were all friends of one another, took perfumes and flowers and robes, and set out with a large retinue to Jetavana, in order to hear the Master preach. Arrived at Jetavana, they sat awhile in the several enclosures—in the enclosure of the Iron-wood trees, in the enclosure of the Sal-trees, and so forth,—till at evening the Master passed from his fragrant sweet-smelling perfumed chamber to the Hall of Truth and took his seat on the gorgeous Buddha-seat. Then, with their following, these young men went to the Hall of Truth, made an offering of perfumes and flowers, bowed down at his feet—those blessed feet that were glorious as full-blown lotus-flowers, and bore imprinted on the sole the Wheel!—and, taking their seats, listened to the Truth. Then the thought came into their minds, “Let us take the vows, so far as we understand the Truth preached by the Master.” Accordingly, when the Blessed One left the Hall, they approached him and with due obeisance asked to be admitted to the Brotherhood; and the Master admitted them to the Brotherhood. Winning the favour of their teachers and directors they received full Brotherhood, and after five years’ residence with their teachers and directors, by which time they had got by heart the two Abstracts, had come to know what was proper and what was improper, had learnt the three modes of expressing thanks, and had stitched and dyed robes. At this stage, wishing to embrace the ascetic life, they obtained the consent of their teachers and directors, and approached the Master. Bowing before him they took their seats, saying, “Sir, we are troubled by the round of existence, dismayed by birth, decay, disease, and death; give us a theme, by thinking on which we may get free from the elements which occasion existence.” The Master turned over in his mind the eight and thirty themes of thought, and therefrom selected a suitable one, which he expounded to them. And then, after getting their theme from the Master, they bowed and with a ceremonious farewell passed from his presence to their cells, and after gazing on their teachers and directors went forth with bowl and robe to embrace the ascetic life.",

The Brethren sat in the Hall of Truth, saying, “Sirs, Devadatta is an ingrate and does not recognise the virtues of the Blessed One.” Returning to the Hall, the Master asked what topic they were discussing, and was told. “This is not the first time, Brethren,” said he, “that Devadatta has proved an ingrate; he was just the same in bygone days also, and he has never known my virtues.” And so saying, at their request he told this story of the past.",

Then descending from mid-air, he seated himself on the river-bank and told this story with reference to that quarrel. (Only a summary is given here; the full details will be related in the Kunala-jataka.) But on this occasion the Master addressed his kinsfolk, saying, “It is meet, sire, that kinsfolk should dwell together in concord and unity. For, when kinsfolk are at one, enemies find no opportunity. Not to speak of human beings, even sense-lacking trees ought to stand together. For in bygone days in the Himalayas a tempest struck a Sal-forest; yet, because the trees, shrubs, bushes, and creepers of that forest were interlaced one with another, the tempest could not overthrow even a single tree but passed harmlessly over their heads. But alone in a courtyard stood a mighty tree; and though it had many stems and branches, yet, because it was not united with other trees, the tempest uprooted it and laid it low. Wherefore, it is meet that you too should dwell together in concord and unity.” And so saying, at their request he told this story of the past.",

Even the pool of Jetavana by the embattled gateway of Jetavana gave out; and the fish and tortoises buried themselves in the mud. Then came the crows and hawks with their lance-like beaks, and busily picked them out writhing and wriggling, and devoured them.",

Hard by the city of Rajagaha, as we are told, was a town named Jagghery, and here dwelt a certain Lord High Treasurer, known as the Millionaire Miser, who was worth eighty crores! Not so much as the tiniest drop of oil that a blade of grass will take up, did he either give away or consume for his own enjoyment. So he made no use of all his wealth either for his family or for sages and brahmins: it remained unenjoyed,—like a pool haunted by demons. Now, it fell out on a day that the Master arose at dawn moved with a great compassion, and as he reviewed those ripe for conversion throughout the universe, he became aware that this Treasurer with his wife some four hundred miles away were destined to tread the Paths of Salvation.",

He, ’Tis said, ingratiated himself with the king, and, after collecting the royal revenue in a border-village, privily arranged with a band of robbers that he would march the men off into the jungle, leaving the village for the rascals to plunder,—on condition that they gave him half the booty. Accordingly, at daybreak when the place was left unprotected, down came the robbers, who slew and ate the cattle, looted the village, and were off with their booty before he came back at evening with his followers. But it was a very short time before his knavery leaked out and came to the ears of the king. And the king sent for him, and, as his guilt was manifest, he was degraded and another headman put in his place. Then the king went to the Master at Jetavana and told him what had happened. “Sire,” said the Blessed One, “the man has only shewn the same disposition now which he shewed in bygone days.” Then at the king’s request he told this story of the past.",
      "ja80": "“You vaunted your prowess.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a certain braggart among the Brethren. Tradition says that he used to gather round him Brethren of all ages, and go about deluding everyone with lying boasts about his noble descent. “Ah, Brethren,” he would say, “there’s no family so noble as mine, no lineage so peerless. I am a scion of the highest of princely lines; no man is my equal in birth or ancestral estate; there is absolutely no end to the gold and silver and other treasures we possess. Our very slaves and menials are fed on rice and meat-stews, and are clad in the best Benares cloth, with the choicest Benares perfumes to perfume themselves withal; whilst I, because I have joined the Brotherhood, [3561 have to content myself with this vile fare and this vile garb.”",

Tradition says that the two had made mud-pies together, and had gone to the same school; but, as years went by, the friend, whose name was ‘Curse,’ sank into great distress and could not make a living anyhow. So he came to the rich man, who was kind to him, and paid him to look after all his property; and the poor friend was employed under Anatha-pindika and did all his business for him. After he had gone up to the rich man’s It was a common thing to hear in the house—“Stand up, Curse,” or “Sit down, Curse,” or “Have your dinner, Curse.” ",
      "ja84": "“Seek health.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a boy who was sage in matters relating to spiritual welfare. When he was only seven years old, the boy, who was the son of a very wealthy Treasurer, manifested great intelligence and anxiety for his spiritual welfare; and one day came to his father to ask what were the Paths leading to spiritual welfare. The father could not answer, but he thought to himself,—“This is a very difficult question; from highest heaven to nethermost hell there is none that can answer it, save only the All-knowing Buddha.” So he took the child with him to Jetavana, with a quantity of perfumes and flowers and unguents. Arrived there, he did reverence to the Master, bowed down before him, and seating himself on one side, spoke as follows to the Blessed One—“Sir, this boy of mine, who is intelligent and anxious for his spiritual welfare, has asked me what are the Paths leading to spiritual welfare; and as I did not know, I came to you. Vouchsafe, O Blessed One, to resolve this question.” “Lay-brother,” said the Master, “this selfsame question was asked me by this very child in former times, and I answered it for him. He knew the answer in bygone days, but now he has forgotten because of change of birth.” Then, at the father’s request, he told this story of the past.",
      "ja85": "“As they who ate.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a concupiscent Brother. Tradition says there was a scion of a good family who gave his heart to the Buddha’s doctrine and joined the Brotherhood. But one day as he was going his round for alms in Savatthi, he was there stirred to concupiscence by the sight of a beautifully dressed woman. Being brought by his teachers and directors before the Master, he admitted in answer to the enquiries of the Blessed One that the spirit of concupiscence had entered into him. Then said the Master, “Verily the five lusts of the senses are sweet in the hour of actual enjoyment, Brother; but this enjoyment of them (in that it entails the miseries of re-birth in hell and the other evil states) is like the eating of the fruit of the What-fruit tree. Very fair to view is the What-fruit, very fragrant-and sweet; but when eaten, it racks the inwards and brings death. In other days, through ignorance of its evil nature, a multitude of men, seduced by the beauty, fragrance and sweetness of the fruit, ate thereof so that they died.” So saying, he told this story of the past.",
      "ja86": "“Naught can compare.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a brahmin who put to the test his reputation for goodness. This Brother, who was maintained by the King of Kosala, had sought the Three Refuges; he kept the Five Commandments, and was versed in the Three Vedas. “This is a good man,” thought the King, and shewed him great honour. But that Brother thought to himself, “The King shews honour to me beyond other brahmins, and has manifested his great regard by making me his spiritual director. But is his favour due to my goodness or only to my birth, lineage, family, country and accomplishments? I must clear this up without delay.” Accordingly, one day when he was leaving the palace, he took unbidden a coin from a treasurer’s counter, and went his way. Such was the treasurer’s veneration for the brahmin that he sat perfectly still and said not a word. Next day the brahmin took two coins; but still the official made no remonstrance. The third day the brahmin took a whole handful of coins. “This is the third day,” cried the treasurer, “that you have robbed his Majesty;” and he shouted out three times,—“I have caught the thief who robs the treasury.” In rushed a crowd of people from every side, crying, “Ah, you’ve long been posing as a model of goodness.” And dealing him two or three blows, they led him before the King. In great sorrow the King said to him, “What led you, brahmin, to do, so wicked a thing?” And he gave orders, saying, “Off with him to punishment.” “I are no thief, sire,” said the brahmin. “Then why did you take money from the treasury?” “Because you shewed me such great honour, sire, and because I made up my mind to find out whether that honour was paid to my birth and the like or only to my goodness. That was my motive, and now I know for certain (inasmuch as you order me off to punishment) that it was my goodness and not my birth and other advantages, that won me your majesty’s favour. Goodness I know to be the chief and supreme good; I know too that to goodness I can never attain in this life, whilst I remain a layman, living in the midst of sinful pleasures. Wherefore, this very day I would fain go to the Master at Jetavana and renounce the world for the Brotherhood. Grant me your leave, sire.” The King consenting, the brahmin set out for Jetavana. His friends and relations in a body tried to turn him from his purpose, but, finding their efforts of no avail, left him alone. He came to the Master and asked to be admitted to the Brotherhood. After admission to the lower and higher orders, he won by application spiritual insight and became an Arahat, whereon he drew near to the Master, saying, “Sir, my joining the Order has borne the Supreme Fruit”—thereby signifying that he had won Arahatship. Hearing of this, the Brethren, assembling in the Hall of Truth, spoke with one another of the virtues of the King’s chaplain who tested his own reputation for goodness and who, leaving the King, had now risen to be an Arahat. Entering the Hall, the Master asked what the Brethren were discussing, and they told him. “Not without a precedent, Brethren,” said he, “is the action of this brahmin in putting to the test his reputation for goodness and in working out his salvation after renouncing the world. The like was done by the wise and good of bygone days as well.” And so saying, he told this story of the past.",
      "ja87": "“Whoso renounces.”—This story was told by the Master while at the Bamboo-grove about a brahmin who was skilled in the prognostications which can be drawn from pieces of cloth. Tradition says that at Rajagaha dwelt a brahmin who was superstitious and held false views, not believing in the Three Gems. This brahmin was very rich and wealthy, abounding in substance; and a female mouse gnawed a suit of clothes of his, which was lying by in a chest. One day after bathing himself all over, he called for this suit, and then was told of the mischief which the mouse had done. “If these clothes stop in the house,” thought he to himself, “they’ll bring ill-luck; such an ill-omened thing is sure to bring a curse. It is out of the question to give them to any of my children or servants; for whosoever has them will bring misfortune on all around him. I must have them thrown away in a charnel-ground; but how? I cannot hand them to servants; for they might covet and keep them, to the ruin of my house. My son must take them.” So he called his son, and telling him the whole matter bade him take his charge on a stick, without touching the clothes with his hand, and fling them away in a charnel-ground. Then the son was to bathe himself all over and return. Now that morning at dawn of day the Master looking round to see what persons could be led to the truth, became aware that the father and son were predestined to attain salvation. So he betook himself in the guise of a hunter on his way to hunt, to the charnel-ground, and sate down at the entrance, emitting the six-coloured rays that mark a Buddha. Soon there came to the spot the young brahmin, carefully carrying the clothes as his father had bidden him, on the end of his stick, just as though he had a house-snake to carry.",

      "ja96": "“As one with care.”—This story was told by the Master while dwelling in a forest near the town of Desaka in the Sumbha country, concerning the Janapada-Kalyani Sutta. For on that occasion the Blessed One said—“Just as if, Brethren, a great crowd were to gather together, crying ‘Hail to the Belle of the Land! Hail to the Belle of the Land!’ and just as if in like manner a greater crowd were to gather together, crying ‘The Belle of the Land is singing and dancing’; and then suppose there came a man fond of life, fearful of death, fond of pleasure, and averse to pain, and suppose such an one were addressed as follows,—‘Hi, there! you are to carry this pot of oil, which is full to the brim, betwixt the crowd and the Belle of the Land; a man with a drawn sword will follow in your footsteps; and if you spill a single drop, he will cut off your head’; what think you, Brethren? Would that man, under these circumstances, be careless, and take no pains in carrying that pot of oil?” “By no manner of means, sir.” “This is an allegory , which I framed to make my meaning clear, Brethren; and here is its meaning—The brimming pot of oil typifies a collected state of mind as regards things concerning the body, and the lesson to be learnt is that such mindfulness should be practised and perfected. Fail not in this, Brethren.” So saying, the Master gave forth the Sutta concerning the Belle of the Land, with both text and interpretation. Then, by way of application, the Blessed One went on to say,—“A Brother desirous of practising right mindfulness concerning the body, should be as careful not to let his mindfulness drop, as the man in the allegory was not to let drop the pot of oil.”",
      "ja97": "“Seeing Quick dead.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a Brother who thought luck went by names. For we hear that a young man of good family, named ‘Base,’ had given his heart to the Faith, and joined the Brotherhood. And the Brethren used to call to him, “Here, Brother Base!” and “Stay, Brother Base,” till he resolved that, as ‘Base’ gave the idea of incarnate wickedness and ill-luck, he would change his name to one of better omen. Accordingly he asked his teachers and preceptors to give him a new name. But they said that a name only served to denote, and did not impute qualities; and they bade him rest content with the name he had. Time after time he renewed his request, till the whole Brotherhood knew what importance he attached to a mere name. And as they sat discussing the matter in the Hall of Truth, the Master entered and asked what it was they were speaking about. Being told, he said “This is not the first time this Brother has believed luck went by names; he was equally dissatisfied with the name he bore in a former age.” So saying he told this story of the past.",
      "ja98": "“Wise rightly, Wisest wrongly.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a cheating merchant. There were two merchants in partnership at Savatthi, we are told, who travelled with their merchandise and came back with the proceeds. And the cheating merchant thought to himself, “My partner has been badly fed and badly lodged for so many days past that he will die of indigestion now he has got home again and can feast to his heart’s content on dainties manifold. My plan is to divide what we have made into three portions, giving one to his orphans and keeping two for myself.” And with this object he made some excuse day by day for putting off the division of the profits.",

For at that time, she, who had carried a child seven years in her womb, was in the seventh day of her throes, and her pains were grievous. In spite of all her agony, she thought as follows—“All-Enlightened is the Blessed One who preaches the Truth to the end that such suffering may cease; righteous are the Elect of the Blessed One who so walk that such suffering may cease; blessed is Nirvana wherein such suffering cloth cease.” These three thoughts were her consolation in her pangs. And she sent her husband to the Buddha to tell her state and bear a greeting for her.",

      "ja102": "“He that should prove.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a lay-brother who was a greengrocer in Savatthi and made a living by the sale of various roots and vegetables, and pumpkins and the like. Now he had a pretty daughter who was as good and virtuous as she was pretty, but was always laughing. And when she was asked in marriage by a family of his own station in life, he thought “She ought to be married, but she’s always laughing; and a bad girl married into a strange family is her parents’ shame. I must find out for certain whether she is a good girl or not.”",
      "ja103": "“If wise, thou ‘lt loiter not.”—This story was told by the Master at Jetavana about Anatha-pindika. For we hear that Anatha-pindika was returning from the village of which he was headman, when he saw robbers on the road. “It won’t do to loiter by the way,” thought he; “I must hurry on to Savatthi.” So he urged his oxen to speed and got safely into Savatthi. Next day he went to the monastery and told the Master what had befallen him. “Sir,” said the Master, “in other times too the wise and good espied robbers on the road and hastened without delay to their homes.” Then at the merchant’s request he told this story of the past.",

      "ja105": "“Fear’st thou the wind.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a Brother who lived in a perpetual state of nervous alarm. We learn that he came of a good family in Savatthi, and was led to give up the world by hearing the Truth preached, and that he was always in fear of his life both by night and by day. The sough of the wind, the rustle of a fan, or the cry of bird or beast would inspire him with such abject terror that he would shriek and dash away. He never reflected that death was sure to come upon him; though, had he practised meditation on the certainty of death, he would not have feared it. For only they that do not so meditate fear death. Now his constant fear of dying became known to the Brethren, and one day they met in the Hall of Truth and fell to discussing his fearfulness and the propriety of every Brother’s taking death as a theme for meditation. Entering the Hall, the Master asked, and was told, what they were discussing. So he sent for that Brother and asked him whether it was true he lived in fear of death. The Brother confessed that he did. “Be not angry, Brethren,” said the Master, “with this Brother. The fear of death that fills his breast, now was no less strong in bygone times.” So saying he told this story of the past.",

      "ja107": "“Prize skill.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a Brother who threw and hit a swan. We are told that this Brother, who came of a good family in Savatthi, had acquired great skill in hitting things with stones; and that hearing the Truth preached one day he gave his heart to it and, giving up the world, was admitted to full Brotherhood. But neither in study nor practice did he excel as a Brother. One day, with a youthful Brother, he went to the river Aciravati, and was standing on the hank after bathing, when he saw two white swans flying by. Said he to the younger Brother, “I’ll hit the hinder swan in the eye and bring it down.” “Bring it down indeed!” said the other; “you can’t hit it.” “Just you wait a moment. I’ll hit it on the eye this side through the eye on the other.” “Oh, nonsense.” “Very well; you wait and see.” Then he took a three-cornered stone in his hand and flung it after the swan. ‘Whiz’ went the stone through the air and the swan, suspecting danger, stopped to listen. At once the Brother seized a smooth round stone and as the resting swan was looking in another direction hit it full in the eye, so that the stone went in at one eye and came out at the other. And with a loud scream the swan fell to the ground at their feet. “That is a highly improper action,” said the other Brother, and brought him before the Master, with an account of what had happened. After rebuking the Brother, the Master said, “The same skill was his, Brethren, in past times as now.” And he told this story of the past.",

The Brethren had assembled in the Hall of Truth and were telling how Devadatta had gone to Gayasisa with five hundred followers, whom he was leading into error by declaring that the Truth was manifest in him “and not in the ascetic Gotama”; and how by his lies he was breaking up the Brotherhood; and how he kept two fast-days a week.

But they kept putting off their departure day by day, till a month flew by. Then they provided a fresh supply of provisions, and procrastinated till a second month was gone, and a third. When their indolence and sluggishness had lost them three months, they set out and came to Jetavana. Laying aside their bowls and robes in the common-room, they came into the Master’s presence. The Brethren remarked on the length of the time since the two had visited the Master, and asked the reason. Then they told their story and all the Brotherhood came to know of the laziness of these indolent Brethren.",
      "ja115": "“The greed-denouncing bird.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a Sister who gave a warning to others. For we are told that she came of a good Savatthi family, but that from the day of her entrance into the Order she failed of her duty and was filled with a gluttonous spirit; she used to seek alms in quarters of the city unvisited by other Sisters. And dainty food was given her there. Now her gluttony made her afraid that other Sisters might go there too and take away from her part of the food. Casting about for a device to stop them from going and to keep everything to herself, she warned the other Sisters that it was a dangerous quarter, troubled by a fierce elephant, a fierce horse, and a fierce dog. And she besought them not to go there for alms. Accordingly not a single Sister gave so much as a look in that direction.",

This Over-Treasurer is said to have been a very rich man of Savatthi, and his wife became the mother of a righteous being from the realm of Brahma angels, who grew up as lovely as Brahma. Now one day when the Kattika festival had been proclaimed in Savatthi, the whole city gave itself up to the festivities. His companions, sons of other rich men, had all got wives, but Over-Treasurer’s son had lived so long in the Brahma Realm that he was purged from passion. His companions plotted together to get him too a sweetheart and make him keep the feast with them. So going to him they said, “Dear friend, it is the great feast of Kattika.. Can’t we get a sweetheart for you too, and have a good time together?” At last his friends picked out a charming girl and decked her out, and left her at his house, with directions to make her way to his chamber. But when she entered the room, not a look or a word did she get from the young merchant. Piqued at this slight to her beauty, she put forth all her graces and feminine blandishments, smiling meantime so as just to shew her pretty teeth. The sight of her teeth suggested bones, and his mind was filled with the idea of bones, till the girl’s whole body seemed to him nothing but a chain of bones. Then he gave her money and bade her begone. But as she came out of the house a nobleman saw her in the street and gave her a present to accompany him home.",
      "ja119": "“No parents trained.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a Brother who used to be noisy at wrong seasons. He is said to have come of a good Savatthi family and to have given up the world for the Truth, but to have neglected his duties and despised instruction. He never took count of the hours for duties, for ministry or for reciting the texts. Throughout the three watches of the night, as well as the hours of waking, he was never quiet; so that the other Brethren could not get a wink of sleep. Accordingly, the Brethren in the Hall of Truth censured his conduct. Entering the Hall and learning on enquiry what they were talking about, the Master said, “Brethren, as now, so in past times, this Brother was noisy out of season, and for his unseasonable conduct was strangled.” So saying he told this story of the past.",

      "ja121": "“Let great and small.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about Anatha-pindika’s true friend. For his acquaintances and friends and relations came to him and tried hard to stop his intimacy with a certain man, saying that neither in birth nor wealth was he Anatha-pindika’s equal. But the great merchant replied that friendship should not depend on equality or inequality of externals. And when he went off to his zemindary, he put this friend in charge of his wealth. Everything came to pass as in the Kalakanni jataka. But, when in this case Anatha-pindika related the danger his house had been in, the Master said, “Layman, a friend rightly so-called is never inferior. The standard is ability to befriend. A friend rightly so-called, though only equal or inferior to one’s self, should be held a superior, for all such friends fail not to grapple with trouble which befalls one’s self. It is your real friend that has now saved you your wealth. So in days gone by a like real friend saved a Sprite’s mansion.” Then at Anatha-pindika’s request, he told this story of the past.",

Entering the Hall, the Master asked what was the subject of their converse. And when they told him, he said, “Brethren, as now, so in former times Devadatta was maddened by hearing my praises.” So saying, he told this story of the past.",
      "ja123": "“For universal application.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about the Elder Laludayi who is said to have had a knack of always saying the wrong thing. He never knew the proper occasion for the several teachings. For instance, if it was a festival, he would croak out the gloomy text, “Without the walls they lurk, and where four cross-roads meet.” If it was a funeral, he would burst out with “Joy filled the hearts of gods and men,” or with “Oh may you see a hundred, nay a thousand such glad days!”",
      "ja124": "“Toil on, my brother.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a good brahmin belonging to a noble Savatthi family who gave his heart to the Truth, and, joining the Brotherhood, became constant in all duties. Blameless in his attendance on teachers; scrupulous in the matter of foods and drinks; zealous in the performance of the duties of the chapter-house, bath-house, and so forth; perfectly punctual in the observance of the fourteen major and of the eighty minor disciplines; he used to sweep the monastery, the cells, the cloisters, and the path leading to their monastery, and gave water to thirsty folk. And because of his great goodness folk gave regularly five hundred meals a clay to the Brethren; and great gain and honour accrued to the monastery, the many prospering for the virtues of one. And one day in the Hall of Truth the Brethren fell to talking of how that Brother’s goodness had brought them gain and honour, and filled many lives with joy. Entering the Hall, the Master asked, and was told, what their talk was about. “This is not the first time, Brethren,” said he, “that this Brother has been regular in the fulfilment of duties, In days gone by five hundred hermits going out to gather fruits were supported on the fruits that his goodness provided.” So saying, he told this story of the past.",

We hear that the Brethren, meeting together in the Hall of Truth, spoke one with another, saying that even as a torch from a pyre, charred at both ends and bedunged in the middle, does not serve as wood either in forest-tree or village-hearth, so Devadatta by giving up the world to follow this saving faith had only achieved a twofold shortcoming and failure, seeing that he had missed the comforts of a-lay life yet had fallen short of his vocation as a Brother.",

In the Hall of Truth sat the Brethren, praising their friendship, when the Master came in, and asked what they talked of as they sat there. They told him; and he replied, “Their friendship in one existence, Brethren, is nothing to wonder at; for wise men of old kept friendliness unbroken throughout three or four different existences.” So saying, he told them a story of the past.",

After breakfast the king went to the monastery, and said, “Why did you return no thanks, Sir?” The Master said, “The people were unpurified, your majesty.” He went on to declare the Law, reciting the stanza that begins “To heaven the avaricious shall not go.” The king, pleased at heart, did reverence to the Tathagata by presenting an outer robe of the Sivi country, worth a thousand pieces of money; then he returned to the city.",

Now when the Blessed One saw the people gathered together, he said to them, “Brethren, this place is crowded: there will be a great gathering. Come now, carry me in a litter to Maddakucchi.” So then the Brethren did. Jivaka made the Tathagata’s foot well. The Brethren sitting before the Master talked of it: “Sirs, a sinner is Devadatta and sinners are all his people; the sinner keeps company with the sinful.” The Master asked, “What do ye talk of, Brethren?” They told him.

The king came to meet him, and relieved him of his bowl, took him up on the terrace, set the Brethren down in due order, gave them the water of welcome, offered them excellent food; after the meal he sat down on one side. “Why,” asked the Master, “why does not Mallika appear?” He said, “’Tis her own foolish pride in her prosperity.” The Master said, “O great king! long, long ago when you were a fairy, you kept apart for one night from your mate, and then went mourning for seven hundred years.” Then at his request, he told a story of the past.",

For light offenses there is no penalty apart from confession. What distinguishes these rules from the other light offenses is that there is no transgression unless the offender is acting out of disrespect for the rule. The <i>sekhiyas</i> are rules of etiquette and as such are often tightly bound to the norms that prevailed in ancient India. Because of temporal and geographical separation from the society in which these rules were established, many of these rules are now obsolete.

Instead, they set out the proper methods for dealing with legal issues. The monastic code and its analysis include only a brief expression of each of these principles, with the detailed exposition on how to apply them found in the <i>Samathakkhandhaka</i>. The legal issues to be settled through these principles fall into four categories: disputes, accusations, offenses, and proceedings. These categories include all legal issues that may arise within a monastic institution.

These units begin with one or more origin stories, which tell the circumstances that led the Buddha to lay down a particular rule. The rule is then stated, followed by a word commentary that analyzes every significant word contained in the rule. After the word commentary follows a permutation series in which a variety of different scenarios are evaluated and offenses assigned as appropriate. At the end comes a non-offense clause, stating important exceptions to the rule, sometimes followed by individual case studies, in which the Buddha decides the offense incurred in ambiguous cases.</p>",

As he starts to accumulate disciples, an ordination procedure gradually evolves.

The chapter also gives the rules regarding the boundary, the <i>sīmā</i>, that defines the extent of a single monastic community. Rules on making amends for offenses are also found here. ",
      "pli-tv-kd3": "The <i>Vassūpanāyikakkhandhaka</i>, “the Chapter on entering the rainy-season residence,” prohibits monastics from traveling during three months of the rainy season.

It also features the stories of the courtesan Ambapālī offering her mango grove to the Order, the conversion of general Sīha, and the exceptional layman Meṇḍaka, after whom the Meṇḍaka allowance is named.

      "ja": "A collection of 547 sets of verses telling stories of the Buddha’s past lives. The canonical Pali collection consists of verses arranged in numbered sets in the Aṅguttara fashion. The shorter sets illustrate a high point of a story, while the longer sets tell a complete story. These verses would have been passed down from the beginning with prose narrative to flesh out the story, which in the Pali is now found in the commentary. It is in the commentary that we find the explicit connection between the stories of the past and the present day, identifying the hero of the tale with the <i>bodhisattva</i> and the major protagonists with the Buddha’s contemporaries. This collection is the main source of Jātakas, but there are many similar stories found elsewhere in the Pali canon (a few in the four <i>nikāyas</i>, others in the Cariyapiṭaka) and throughout the Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit texts. Most of the Jātakas began life as folk tales or myths, drops from the vast ocean of story in oral culture. Several Jātakas record versions of famous Hindu myths, while others share a common basis with European folk tales. The verse forms in the Jātakas are mostly of the earlier kinds, and the social and political reflect historical realities in the centuries before the Buddha, where, for example, Varanasi was an independent kingdom. The Jātakas are the oldest, largest, and best-preserved collection of ancient stories found anywhere in the world. One of the central themes is renunciation, with multiple stories depicting the hero going-forth from the home, each time from a different perspective. Jātakas generally illustrate moral messages, but since the hero is supposed to be imperfect, it is not unusual for him to be portrayed as making dubious choices, even breaking precepts. Taken as a whole, the Jātaka literature is a vast tapestry of story illustrating the twisting and uncertain path to Awakening. The Jātaka genre proved a popular and effective framework for incorporating popular tales into a Buddhist context. They feature prominently in Buddhist art both ancient and modern, and are a primary means of introducing Buddhism to children in modern Theravāda.",

He is usually identified with Menander I Soter, who ruled an Indo-Greek kingdom from his capital of Sagala around BCE 165–130. While the encounter between Greek and Indian culture is fascinating, the dialogs concern only interpretation of Buddhist ideas, with which the king was evidently very familiar, and does not mention Greek philosophy. The text is lively and dynamic, with the King constantly testing Nāgasena with abstruse questions, to which he responds with ingenious arguments and analogies. The text has a shorter Chinese counterpart in the Nāgasena Bhikṣu Sūtra. The text is not Theravādin in origin, but began among one of the schools in the north-west, perhaps the Sarvāstivādins. Most of the content, however, is not sectarian in nature. The Pali text has been extended over the years, and in addition, portions appear to be missing.

It was translated into Chinese in three fascicles by Xuanzang dated July 14th, CE 663 in Yü-hua Monastery (玉華寺).

      "vk": "The full title is Abhidharmavijñānakāyapādaśāstra (Apidamo Shi Shen Zu Lun, 阿毘達磨識身足論).This is a counterpart of the Pali Kathāvatthu, and may share a common historical basis. The text mentions the Theravādin Moggaliputtatissa, author of the Kathāvatthu, as an opponent in the debate on the key Sarvāstivāda doctrine that all phenomena exist in the past, future, and present. The text discusses far fewer points than the Kathāvatthu, however.

In the Taishō edition of the Chinese canon, it is text number 1542, located at T vol. 26, 692b.

It was composed by Kātyāyanīputra and translated in twenty fascicles by Xuanzang on February 14th, 657–June 20th, 660 in Yü-hua Monastery (玉華寺), Hsi-ching (西京). The largest of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidhamma books, this formed the basis for the later Sarvāstivāda treatises, and hence the modern study of Abhidharma especially in Tibetan Buddhism. In the Taishō edition of the Chinese canon, it is text number 1544, located at T vol. 26, 918a. There was an earlier translation by Saṅghadeva and Zhu-fo-nian in CE 383, which may be found at T 1543.",

      "mvs": "The full title is Abhidharmamahāvibhāṣaśāstra (Apidamo Dapiposha Lun, 阿毘達磨大毘婆沙論). This is the major commentarial treatise of the Sarvāstivādin school. It was compiled by Katyāyāniputra, but attributed to 500 arahants around 600 years after the Buddha. This possibly refers to a council held under the auspices of King Kanishka. Translated by Xuanzang August 18th, 656–July 27th, 659. It doesn’t fall within the scope of SuttaCentral, except it contains a few recognized sutta parallels as quotations.

      "sab": "The Śāriputrābhidharmaśāstra (Shelifu Apitan Lun, 舍利弗阿毘曇論) is the only extant work of the Dharmaguptaka Abhidhamma, and was translated in thirty facsicles by Dharmayaśas and Dharmagupta in CE 408 at Ch'ang An (長安).

In the Taishō edition of the Chinese canon, it is text number 1548, located at T vol. 28, 525a.",
      "san-dk": "This text appears to share a common origin with the Vibhaṅga of the Pali tradition. It is maintained today in a complete Chinese and partial Sanskrit version. The Sanskrit text was among the finds at Gilgit. The digital text is based on the editions by Dietz and Matsuda, and was inputted by Klaus Wille for GRETIL. Compared to the Vibhaṅga, the method appears to be less formalized and more discursive, quoting a range of sutta passages. It was written by Śāriputra (according to the Sanskrit and Tibetan sources) or Maudgalyāyana (according to Chinese sources). The Chinese edition was translated by Xuanzang and may be found at T 1537."
