# BB and Horner follow comm in rendering sugata/duggata as “well behaved”. But it is not clear that it can have this sense, I cannot find any other source. Normally they mean “in a sorry state or good state”, “poor and prosperous”, eg SN 15.11, Thig 5.12, AN 5.200, DN 33. Now, out current sentence starts with “whether in a Sangha or alone”. So whoever this is talking about, it cannot refer to “practice” in the strict sense, as it must include local villagers. Of course it can still refer to general behavior. But I see no reason to depart from the normal sense. MA 186 just has a regular term for sugata here (善逝) so that is no help.
