# Parivāra can mean “upholstery”, etc., i.e. accompaniments, etc. That seems to be the point of the Comm’s “Saparivārañca dānaṃ adāsīti annaṃ pānanti dasavidhaṃ dānavatthuṃ.” But given that the kammic outcome is a large following, should this not rather be “he gave both gifts and following”, i.e. he was not stingy with letting his workers, etc. work for others. Unless, of course, it is a mere pun. Anyway, I keep the more conservative reading.
