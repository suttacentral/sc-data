# BB’s rendering of sacca as “substance” is straight out of the comm’s “svabhava”, a concept that is alien to the suttas. The suttas nowhere support an ontology that things exist because of an underlying “substance”. Also, I think BB is mistaken to include this as Sonakayana’s speech. Our text clearly closes the former segment with quote mark, showing that the editor thought it ended there, even though there’s no “ti”. Crucially, the vocative “bho” is used, which is regularly used by brahmins speaking with the Buddha, but not, so far as I know, by a brahmin student speaking with his teacher.
