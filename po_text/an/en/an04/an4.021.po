# BB has the more literal “live in dependence on”. the term is more normally used for the town that an ascetic lives near. Like many upa-words, it conveys something of “closeness”, a certain warmth. As an accomplished, mature man, to say that he would live “as a dependent” is too strong. What’s conveyed is more of a sense of mentorship, someone who you can turn to when you need, not someone you necessarily “depend” on in the narrow sense.
