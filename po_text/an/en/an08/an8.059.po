# BB follows comm in translating samahita in the sense of “comprised of”. But sila, samadhi, panna are of course found everywhere in the suttas. And after looking though 100 uses of samahita in the suttas, I didn’t find a single one where it meant anything other than samadhi. I’d need a strong reason to think otherwise here, and there’s no real reason for it, other than a somewhat unusual phrasing, easily explained by the poetic context.
