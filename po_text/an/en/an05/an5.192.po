# BB treats pavattar as equivalent to kattar, hence “creator”, and pavutta as from vac, i.e. reciter. However it seems likely that they are from the same root, cf occasional variant pavatta as noted in PTS dict. They relate to pavattita, cf. the rolling forth of the dhammacakka, and have the sense of “roll forth, i.e. propagate, spread” rather than either create or recite. Note that this statement is spoken by the Buddha to brahmins, and is an attack on their notion that the verses were spoken by Brahma, substituting a naturalistic explanation.

# BB has “virginal celibacy” here, doubling down on the sexual connotations. But while the dictionaries associate kumara/komara with virginity, I must say I can’t find any strong early confirmation for this. In the current context, komarabrahmacariya doesn’t occur very often. The Comm says nothing on this sutta, but the comm on Snp 2.7 says kumārabhāvato pabhuti caraṇena (lived since childhood), and does not bring in a sexual connotation.
