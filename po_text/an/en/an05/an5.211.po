# chinnaparipantha is apparently unique. BB has “cuts of the outlet”. But paripantha has no attested meaning as “outlet”. The PTS dict does mention this, and gives a couple of refs, but it seems to be mistaken, as neither of these in fact support the reading. Nor is that meaning found in MW: http://sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=paripantha&lang=sans&action=Search But if we take the normal meaning of paripantha, how is a parajika to “cut off the obstacle”. I propose reading as a dvanda: chinno paripantho. Also note that in this passage the vā only is used for the first three items, which might suggest the last two were added.
