# I disagree with BB’s reading of sajjati. The Skt root that he accepts, sṛj, rendered as “begotten”, has the basic meaning of “emit, discharge”. It’s attested in the context of procreation in the Rg Veda, where presumably it refers to the emission of semen. However the verses below are not concerned to answer the question of how procreation happens, but of how an embryo grows in the womb. I.e. not about “emission” but about “sticking around”.
