msgctxt "sn56.8:0.3"
msgid "8. Cintasutta"
msgstr "8. State of Mind"

# While this phrase is on the whole clearly a synonym for the previous sutta, the phrasing is interestingly different. The use of singular shows that citta here means “mind state”, not “thought”; but since we are concerned with theories, we use “idea”. Cinteti straddles the meaning of vitakketi and ceteti “intends”, which is quite nicely represented by the English idiom “(to) think (something) up”.
