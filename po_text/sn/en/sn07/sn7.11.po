# In his translation of Snp 1.4, Khantipalo points out that rice is “planted” rather than “sown”, as the seedlings are transferred and replanted, rather than cast onto the soil. While this is true, a variety of grains were cultivated in India, and our text does not specify rice. Also, while BB has “ploughman” for Kasi, I feel this is too literal. The description below includes all aspects of farming. And in English, a ploughman is a basic laborer, whereas he is clearly a wealthy landowner.
