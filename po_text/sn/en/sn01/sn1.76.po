# BB read citta, but this is certainly wrong. At AN 10.73 we have ālasyaṃ anuṭṭhānaṃ bhogānaṃ paripantho, which must surely have the same meaning. The point is that the question pitches at a worldly level, and the Buddha raises it up, as per usual in the sagathavagga. This makes the whole metaphor of “holes “and” remain” far more straightforward.
