# NOTE: While these terms may be translated differently according to context, BB’s pasadika = “tranquil” is incorrect; it is part of a stock list of terms meaning “beautiful, attractive”. AN 4.85, etc. Lakkhanna as “auspicious” is also questionable. It is apparently unique in the EBTs. Whereas it may have this sense, following the principle of least meaning I take as not introducing a new theme of “auspiciousness “but as reinforcing the previous terms, i.e.” possesses memorable and remarkable features, i.e. outstanding or striking”.
