# NOTE: veṭhakanatapassāhi is otherwise unattested. At MN 55 veṭhaka evidently means “collar”. The Lokuttaravada Bhikshuni Vinaya has a rule about this, Pn 3: https://suttacentral.net/skt/skt-lo-bi-pn3. Thullananda gets out of the water and wraps herself only in a vethaka. Here this seems to be synonymous with paṭṭaka, i.e. a strip of cloth. It is allowable if used to tie on a basket, etc. Edgerton’s BHS dict does not notice this occurrence, but says of a ref in Mahavastu “something that wraps, covers: in a list of goldsmith’s products”, noting however a number of variants. Nata is “curve”, passa is “side, flank”. MW has “flounces and furbelows”, RD “fringes and furbelows round their loins”. These are hopelessly prissy descriptions of what sounds like the clothes of a stripper or lap-dancer.
