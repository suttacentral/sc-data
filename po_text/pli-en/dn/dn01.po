# NOTE: saṅkhiyadhamma is a unique term, occurring, so far as I can tell, nowhere else in the Pali literature. The commentary glosses as kathadhamma, and thus Bodhi and Thanissaro effectively just have it as 'conversation". Rhys Davids followed by Wals have something like "trend of conversation." Yet it seems to me that such a unique term in such a prominent position should have a more specific maning. I am not aware of elsewhere in the ENTs where sankya has the plain sense "conversation". rather, it is connected with the notion of evaluation, measuring. Here the subject of discussion is the different ways the two parties evaluate the Sangha.

# NOTE: I think this passage is more gently critical of the monks than implied in previous translations. The phrasing here is somewhat unusual and specific, and is more active than just “giving way”: they “should not do” what creates bitterness (i.e. sit around judging others). Cp MN 22, where the same phrases are used. In the Buddha’s case, it has the neutral hoti, while for the mendicants it uses karaniya, as here.
