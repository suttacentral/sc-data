# NOTE: The title is not easy to translate. There is no reason to think apadāna was yet in use as a standard term for “story of past lives”; rather, such usage derived from here. Chinese versions of the text have completely different titles: “Seven Buddhas”, “The Great Root”, “Vipassi Buddha”, “The Lineage of the Seven Past Buddhas”. Only the second of these might relate to the Pali. The sense seems to have been “(story about) reaping results of deeds”.

# NOTE: Both RD and MW say this is the lifespan in that eon. And it is true that this is the normal usage of ayuppamana. However, in such cases the subject in genitive is given as plural, to denote the entire generation, etc. Here it is singular, and specifies only Vipassi. Sure, it’s likely that this would have been typical, but I don’t think that’s what the text is saying. Note that when the Buddha speaks of his own life, he uses a different phrasing. If ayuppamana here referred to the lifespan of the current generation, there would be no reason for the Buddha to not apply it to himself. But if it means that of the individual, then it makes sense why he would shift to a more indirect statement.
