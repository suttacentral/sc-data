BB has “locks between the horns” which follows the comm, although I’m not sure where he gets “locks” from; nor do Indian oxen, so far as I can see, actually have grabable locks between the horns. The sanskrit dicts have “nape of the neck” for ghāṭā, Surely the reference is to the prominent hump of a brahman bull; ghata therefore = pot. As the following photos show, bulls are in fact caught by this; trigger warning, these show the cruel practice of bull fighting in India: http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_2OnuVo3kYwo/S_ldstChAXI/AAAAAAAABvI/DX5-UinwvSA/s1600/Jallikkattu+in+India+(2).jpg http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/128/590x/secondary/bulls-432696.jpg http://binscorner.com/mails/t/the-insane-bull-riders-of-tamil-nadu-ind/125075821559.jpg

# NOTE: samanvesati is a rare term, and it is used in SN 4.23 and SN 22.87 to describe Mara looking in vain for the consciousness of an arahant after they’ve died. Given that gati is a normal term of “place where you get reborn”, I think it has the same meaning here. This also agrees with the simile, where the complete dismemberment of the vina suggests death, indeed parinbibbana. More literally, it would “as far as there is a place of rebirth for form …” The point is similar to the notion that it is only the aggregates that get reborn. The mendicant is searching all states of rebirth and finding only khandhas, just as the king searched the vina and found only parts.
