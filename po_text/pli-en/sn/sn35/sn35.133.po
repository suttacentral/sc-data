# NOTE: BB follows CPD (and Cone) in taking acariyabhariya here in the sense of “female teacher”. Much as I would like to, I don’t find this convincing. It seems to me that the meaning as “teacher’s wife” is well established and we need a good reason to think it means something else here. The issue is, of course, that earlier the student is said to be the antevasi of the lady, hence she must be his acariya. But I don’t think this conflicts with the idea that she is his “teacher’s wife”; in fact I think it’s the most likely explanation. The youth was a student of a brahmin, who most likely passed away. But the wife was also learned, so he kept studying with her. This explains the linguistic situation, but more importantly, why there’s a female teacher in the first place.
