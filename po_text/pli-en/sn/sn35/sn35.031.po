# NOTE: See BB’s note. The commentarial explanation on which BB’s translation is based is contrived and misses the point. Here bhava, as usual, means (crudely) “eternal existence in heaven”, etc. That’s what people are attached to, eternal existence, not “becoming”. The point is that they conceive it to be an eternal self, but all they can base conceiving on is sense experience, which is always changing.
