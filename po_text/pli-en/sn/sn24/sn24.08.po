# NOTE: I note a few places my interpretation differs from BB’s. For the ajivakasatani, etc., I find it implausible that anyone would classify so many types of wanderers. On the other hand, we know that the Jains maintained a census of the numbers of their following, and something similar is found in the EBTs, too. So I think this should be a census of their population. Similar problems occur throughout, so I play it safe by not specifying “kind of”. In addition, given the context, I think nāgavāsa is a corruption of naggavāsa, and translate accordingly. For -gabbha, I take this as somewhat similar to the Buddha’s teaching about those who arise in the womb either mindful or not. For pavuta, and its variants, this is extremely dubious. However, from the context i think it’s likely to refer to some geoform. I take it from pa+vāta.
