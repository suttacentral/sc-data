# BB has dreadful, bitter and vile for daruna, katuka, and pharusa. But the three words are in meaning and metaphor similar in Pali and completely unrelated in English. The underlying sense is not of “causing fear” although they certainly do that. It is of “hard (daru=wood), harsh, unyielding, rough”, and more metaphorically, “vicious, violent, brutal”. In other words, they are qualities of the damage things can do, not of the emotions they can arouse.
