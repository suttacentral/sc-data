# NOTE: niccabhikkha is a curious idiom, not, so far as I know, discussed in any available dictionary. In Ja 398 it refers to the daily offering of food to a yakkha, and this must be the early meaning. here and at MN 94 it is explicitly said to refer to money, so this must have evolved. the fact that there Udena has to ask what kind of offering it is shows that it still might have meant food.
