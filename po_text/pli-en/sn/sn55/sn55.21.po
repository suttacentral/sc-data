# NOTE: BB has “congested thouroughfares’ for sbadhabyuha, which, admittedly, makes more sense. However, byuha is only defined at one place in the canon, bi-vb-pc14: Byūhaṃ nāma yeneva pavisanti teneva nikkhamanti.” Byuha means, you come out the same way you go in “. BB says the comm explanation suggests byuha means a main road.” Sambādhabyūhanti byūhā vuccanti avinibbiddharacchāyo, yā paviṭṭhamaggeneva niggacchanti, tā sambādhā byūhā bahukā etthāti sambādhabyūhaṃ. “I’ll have to take his word for that, because I don’t know what” avinibbiddharacchāyo “means. Still,” yā paviṭṭhamaggeneva niggacchanti"is clearly referring back to the Vinaya definition, which suggests we should take it in the same meaning.
