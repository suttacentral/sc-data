# NOTE: The fact that the term satthavaha is used in such a solemn context in a society that has so long been sedentary speaks to it being an old cultural relic of the Aryans. This, as well as the context in general, speaks against anana here being based on debtless, a crude financial metaphor. The Skt root ṛṇa was originally a more generally term for the duties, especially spiritual, that a brahmin should perform, such as sacrifice and worship. In other words, the term is similar to the familiar katakicco. See http://sanskritdictionary.com/%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%87a/44184/1
