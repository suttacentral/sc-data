# NOTE: Ghata means either “pot “or” heap, mass”. BB prefers the former, but I find it gives a somewhat weak simile. I think Moggallana was referring something more like this (http://c8.alamy.com/comp/FMYC1W/picture-made-available-on-15-june-2010-showing-an-indian-salt-worker-FMYC1W.jpg) than like this (http://www.eatonvillenews.net/images/Bob/BOB%20FILTER%20PLANT%20TOUR%20SALT%20BARREL%20%20(OP)%20JAN.%2013,%2007%20012.jpg)
