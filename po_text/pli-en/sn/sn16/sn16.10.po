# NOTE: BB has “the bhikkhunis’ quarters”. But the text has aññatara, which is definitely indefinite. It suggests that there were several such quarters, not surprising in such a large monastery. The term “upassaya” should be compared with upasika, upanishad, upatthaka, etc. It seems the sense is of a section attached to a monks’ monastery. The term is only used of nuns. Given that this is probably set between the parinibbana and the First Council, the location in Savatthi seems unlikely.

# NOTE: Matugama is regularly used both for “females “and “a female”. For the latter use, see eg AN 5.75, AN 5.76, AN 4.122, AN 4.197, and so on. In the patimokkha it is always used in this sense. In this case, the problem is clearly with one individual, and there is no cause to make it a snarky remark about all women. One of the basic principles of translation is compassion. Unless there is good reason, we should assume that our texts make sense. There are many cases where it is possible to translate a text in a way that appears meaningless, but we don’t, because we assume that those who created the texts had at minimum a reasonable degree of common sense. Moreover, we have seen Ānanda’s character in countless texts, and this was not the kind of man he was. Thus I disagree with BB’s assertion that his translation “women are foolish” is the only possible one. My translation is not merely possible, it is more likely. Full disclosure: I was the “consultant” that BB refers to in his notes.
