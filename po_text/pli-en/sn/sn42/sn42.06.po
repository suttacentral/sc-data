# NOTE: See BB for note on this unique passage. Here sannapeti is causitive from san+yapeti, not san+janati. BB seems to be reading “nama” here as indicanting a report, “said”. I’m not sure that this is correct, and it seems to me more likely it’s the common emphatic sense of nama. In the former case, the speaker is distancing himself from this view, in the latter, supporting it.
