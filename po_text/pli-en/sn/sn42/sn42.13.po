# NOTE: Dhammasamadhi is a unique term. The various meanings given in the commentary (see BB) betray a lack of clarity in the meaning. MA 20 has 有法之定，名曰遠離, transl. by Analayo/Bucknell as “there is a Dharma meditation called abandoning.” BB’s “concentration of the Dhamma” is unclear and incorrect. From the explanation below it is clear that “samadhi” here has it’s usual meaning. The “dhamma” means “principle” of cause and effect. It’s talking about how you can use wisdom to reflect on the principles of causality, which gives rise to joy and samadhi. This use of “dhamma” is the normal meaning of dhamma in such meditation contexts, eg dhammanupassana or dhammavicaya. BB’s translation “in that” for tatra ce below is overly literal, and it reinforces the perception in the comm that dhammasamadhi and cittasamadhi are different things. They’re not. Tatra ce (below) is not a common idiom, but when BB translates it elsewhere he typically uses just “if” (AN 4.129, AN 6.64). The tatra here does not mean “in that meditation object”, but “in this context, regarding this” and must be idiomatically rendered or omitted.
