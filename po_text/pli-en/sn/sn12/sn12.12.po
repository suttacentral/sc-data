# NOTE: It’s not clear to me exactly how the abbreviations are meant to work here. My guess is that the formula should be expanded for the remaining items. However the commentary gives an explanation for why “Ko nu kho, bhante, bhavatī” is not included, so if the abbreviations are lost, it was before that time. BB’s translation choices here confuse me, as well. He omits without comment the section on “who grasps”, although this is apparently found in all manuscripts, and is assumed in the commentary. And he includes the sentence “With feeling as condition, craving [comes to be]; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence” which is not found in the Pali. I’m not sure if this is an oversight, or if he’s abbreviating. Also, note that the “cessation” sequence starting just below omits the vinnanahara, and begins with the salayatana. Perhaps the original text featured just the vinnanahara, and the subsequent sections were grafted on. This would explain the grammatically clumsy transition from vinnanahara to slayatana, with namarupa omitted.
