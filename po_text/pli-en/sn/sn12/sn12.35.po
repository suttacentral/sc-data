# NOTE: Once again quotes in text are incorrect. Re visuka, visevita, vippandita, these are curiously hard to pin down as they only occur in this and one or two other passages that are equally unclear. “phandamana” is used in the context of a fish struggling in a dried up stream. (snp 4.15) In MN 65 the three are applied to a horse struggling against the bit. And at SN 4.24 the three are applied by Mara to himself. BB has “contortion, writhing, and vacillation”, or “distortions, manouevers and contortions “or” contortions, manouevers and vacillations”, without any apparent reason for the differences. At MN2 for visuka, vipphandita Thanissaro has “contortion, writhing” where BB has “contortion, vacillation”. None of these are hugely satisfying. Given that we haven’t got much in the way of clear differentiation, we should assume that the terms are synonyms, but for example “contortions, manouevers and vacillations” are all three quite distinct ideas. Now, the horse is presumably twisting and turning to get away from the bit, while the fish out of water is the same. Mara is known for his deceits, for trying to get at the Buddha using any manner of deceitful tricks. It seems to me “tricks, dodges, and evasions” fits reasonably well.
