# NOTE: See BB’s note on the odd structure of this template. The first phrase has four terms, but the counterpart has only three. However the final two of those, abhinibbatti and patubhava, are synonyms, and appear together in the stock definition of jati. Given the connection with old age and death here, it seems probable that they should be read together.
