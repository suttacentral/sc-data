# NOTE: The line and it’s metaphorical interpretation work on two levels. The oka and niketa are the same basic meaning, but I have translated in line with the underlying etymology: oka from “place of comfort, shelter”, niketa as “heaping, settlement”. Sari means “wander, roam, drift”. Here it has a literal meaning, a homeless wanderer. But later one is said to be a “okasari” “house-wanderer”. How does this make sense? The root -sari is the same as the root for samsara, and so an okasari is one who wanders in samsara. Compare the standard simile for the dibbacakkhu, where a person walks out of one home down the street, and into another. Cf the modern idiom “couch-surfer”. I use the same term as i use for samsara to bring out this connection.sc2
