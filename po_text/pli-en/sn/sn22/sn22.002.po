# NOTE: The identification of elagala with cassia tora, found in BB, PTS dict, and ultimately probably derived from MW, is unsatisfactory. It is a weed, growing 50cm or so high, hardly a fitting place for meditation, and completely contradicting the commentary. The alternative, Cassia alata or Senna alata is better, since it grows 3-4 M tall, with a glorious golden flower. However it’s native to Mexico. The Chinese parallels don’t seem to offer any assistance. SA 108 has 坐一堅固樹下, where 堅固 might stand for gāḍha, and thus the compound ekagāḍha. But this gets us no further in understanding the sanskrit. Moreoever 堅固 may also stand for sāla or sāla-vṛkṣa, so it could just mean standing under “a” sal tree, where 一 stands for annatara. Sticking with the Cassia family, I’ve gone with cassia fistula, which would at lest be a nice place to meditate!
