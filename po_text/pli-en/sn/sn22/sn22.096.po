# NOTE: Re. dukūlasandhanāni with vll. as noted here, BB at AN 9.20 has has “jute tethers”, noting “Mp does not provide a gloss and PED does not offer a useful definition under any of those readings. But in PED sandāna is defined as “cord, tether, fetter.””. At SN 22.96 he has “tethers of fine jute”. However, jute is a coarse cloth and can hardly be meant here. Skt dictionaries consistently say “Woven silk, silk-garment, a very fine garment in general”, which fits with our context. The only commentarial gloss I can find for this is that on SN 22.96, which says “Dukūlasandānānīti dukūlasantharāni”. But this yields the sense, “cover or mat”, which may be right, but is less than convincing. At MN 98, a reference missed by PTS dict, we have sandāna as part of the equipment of a horse that is cut by one who is freed. There I render as “reins”, and this seems apt here too.
