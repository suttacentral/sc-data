# NOTE: See BB’s note for the difficult readings here. I follow him accepting the amended reading katthakalingara. However I am puzzled at why he renders avassajjati as “fastens”, saying this “follows the verb”. I’m not aware of any context where this verb means that. In fact, avassajjati/ossajjati (and its many variant spellings) means to opposite: to release, send off, etc. Why would the hunter walk off carrying the block of tarred wood? Surely it means that he released the monkey from the wood, thus achieving what the monkey could not. A similar sense is associated with yena kamam pakkamati at AN 5.75.
