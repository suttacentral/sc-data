# NOTE: The phrase dhammanvaya occurs, as well as here, at MN 89 (by Pasenadi) and MN 12 (in reference to Sunakkhatta, albeit in negative). It thus seems to me that it can’t mean a particularly deep insight, such as is unique to Sariputta. The other striking characteristic of the term is that it always occurs in connection with the Buddha personally. In MN 89, Pasenadi sees various things such as the behavior of the monks, then makes his inference. Similarly, here it is inferred from characteristics of the teaching. Thus it seems it means an inference (about the Buddha) as implied by his teaching and the way it’s practiced.
