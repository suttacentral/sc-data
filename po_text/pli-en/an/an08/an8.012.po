# NOTE: BB’s note on this accepts without question the notion that the Jains were vegetarians, which would make the argument of the current sutta, as he says, bordering on disingenuous. However it is quite well-known that Jain texts, including the earliest, the Acaranga, specify meat as allowable in certain contexts. See Acaranga Sutra 2.1.10.5-6 (http://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/sbe2256.htm); Dasaveyaliya 5.1.73 and 5.1.84-86. This was accepted by at least some Jaina commentaries. Modern hesitancy over stating this plainly is a result of political lobbying by Jains: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Jacobi%27s_letter_on_Acaranga_controversy_of_meat-eating Of course, whether this sutta accurately represents the Jains is a separate question. But clearly the difference is not as great as it might seem.
