# NOTE: BB translates the commentary with his “convivial”. Horner, followed by Brahmali, have “enjoyment”. But nibbhoga is always used in the sense of “useless, abandoned”. SN 7.14 “Assova jiṇṇo nibbhogo,” Pv 12, Ja 354 “Evaṃ sarīre nibbhoge, pete kālaṅkate sati”. Here it probably means “has no use for polite standards”, thus similar to the previous.

# NOTE: BB follows comm in seeing apagabbha as a pun between a-pagabbha and apa-gabbha. But the negative for pagabbha is appagabbha, and moreover it’s always used in a positive sense. In the other terms used in this list, the Buddha shifts the meaning of the word, but he doesn’t invoke an entirely different word. I think it’s best to follow CPD and simply see it as a term of abuse.

msgstr "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. "
