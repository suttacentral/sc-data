# NOTE: In BB’s translation, this pair of statements contradict each other. He “is not capable” of remembering, yet he examines what he has remembered. I think the text is not actually contradictory. We should read -jatika as meaning “natural-born, talented”, and translate as “readily memorize”. Thus someone who is not a natural memorizer, even though it’s hard for them to memorize things, still manage to remember some things (Culapanthaka!), and these are what they examine.
