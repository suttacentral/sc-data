# NOTE: The text says “fallen into a grave offence”. The grave offences are the sanghadisesas, and the relevant rules are 2-4, which deal with sexual harassment either verbally or physically. I think it’s important to make this clear. Also, the phrasing of this is odd in several ways. Why not use a more normal phrase for someone who has gone forth? Regardless, both Horner and Thanissaro mistranslate this. I follow BB’s construal of the grammar.
