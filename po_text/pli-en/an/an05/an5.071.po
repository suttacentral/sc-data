# NOTE: These similes all relate meaningfully to their explanations, but it’s not always possible to capture this in English. 1. “lifted the crossbar” = overcome ignorance, removed the blocks to knowledge. 2. “filled in the trench” = ended samsara. This one is obscure, but I think it means that you’re trapped by trenches, kept within the bounds of samsara, and when they’re filled in you can escape. 3. “pulled up the pillar” = give up craving. This one relies on a pun in the Pali: pillar = esika, which also means “seeking”. No pillar, no seeking, no craving. 4. Unbarred = giving up fiver lower fetters, a fetter is a bar. “lowering the flag” = giving up conceit. The flag is used as an identifier so you know who is who: no flag, no self.
