# NOTE: I am not sure what guna means in this context. DOP says “string of a musical instrument” for this context, but why not continue using tanti for this? BB does not use string, but has “balanced pitch”, and I am unsure if he is explicitly rendering guna as “pitch” or merely translating the overall sense. “Pitch” would seem to be a possible reading for guna, but i can’t find it attested anywhere. The normal word would be yama. Perhaps it is simply a more vague phrase, “fixed at an even quality”.

# NOTE: I think BB’s “balanced” is wrong for samatha. It occurs very commonly, of course, and it always means “settle”, not “balance”. Moreover at AN 6.116 we have Uddhaccassa pahānāya samatho bhāvetabbo, which repeates a familiar theme, that samatha abandons restlessness, i.e. the problem mentioned in the previous sentence. So I take it as a dvanda with samatha in its normal meaning. And as always, nimitta never means “object” or anything like it. This phrase means that one should understand this principle in terms of cause and effect, so that you know what to do.
