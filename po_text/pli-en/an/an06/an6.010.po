# NOTE: BB’s “simply straight” for ujugata strikes me as unhelpfully literal. It seems to me the point is that the mind is focussed on the meditation and doesn’t deviate from it. See Dhp 33, where a “wobbling” (=capala) arrow is made “ujugata”. Here uju means both literally “straight”, but with the metaphorical point that the arrow doesn’t wobble in flight. “Sure “or” true” could work, but only if the sense is made clear in context, something like “their mind’s aim is true”.
