# NOTE: Contra BB’s “outskirts of a village”, gamanta must mean “in a village”, or perhaps “in a village neighborhood”. It is regularly contrasted with aranna, and never with plain old “gama”. I use “village district” for gamakkhetta, strictly “a village together with its fields”, and “neighborhood of a village” for gamanta.
