# NOTE: This specific phrasing is shared with MN 136 and AN 6.62. In both cases, the context follows a case where a junior monk has made a silly statement. I think the phrasing is meant to express a certain frustration, if I may dare to use such a term of the Buddha! The parsing of vibhajantassa is problematic, see BB’s note on AN 6.62.
