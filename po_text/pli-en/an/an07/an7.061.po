# NOTE: BB translates pacchāpuresaññī as “what is behind you and what is in front”, which seems ti imply it is taken in a spatial sense, i.e. aware of the path before and after. However, the phrase frequently occurs in a temporal sense, where it emphasizes the continuity of perception: Pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati—yathā pure tathā pacchā … Of course it could be a different contextual meaning. however the contexts share a lot in common. In those cases we find such expressions as appaṇihitaṃ me bahiddhā cittan’ti pajānāti. Atha pacchāpure ‘asaṅkhittaṃ vimuttaṃ appaṇihitan’ti pajānāti; na ca bahiddhā vikkhitto bhavissati. Pacchāpuresaññī ca viharati It seems the phrase is used consistently to emphasize that attention is focussed constantly and internally as against the mind scattered externally.
