# NOTE: These phrases are evocative, and they should remain so in translation, rather than being too explicit. Jalini is a particularly feminine form, which relates to the widespread image in myth of women who weave the thread of worlds fates (eg http://www.creativitypost.com/arts/myth_and_creativity_ariadnes_thread_and_a_path_through_the_labyrinth). Sarita is, I think, correctly glossed in the comm (Saritanti tattha tattha saritvā saṃsaritvā ṭhitaṃ) but BB’s transl. of the comm in his note doesn’t quite catch it. I would translate: “Sarita means “it remains after migrating and transmigrating through many lives”.” By using migrant I hope to connect it with transmigration. For visata I think the sense is that it’s inescapable: like a net or stream it catches you everywhere.

# NOTE: Many of these expressions are obscure, although the overall intent is clear. BBs translation follows the comm, from which I have departed in a few cases. For asasmīti hoti, satasmīti I derive from sat rather than sid, following Woodward and Piya Tan. However, the implication of existence is “eternal existence” so the meaning ends up the same, except the terms are reversed. for “san-ti” I tak san=sa4 in PTS dict, i.e sva=own, whereas BB takes it as siyā.
