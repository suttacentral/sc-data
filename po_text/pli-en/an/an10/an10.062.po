# NOTE: BB has “not listening to the true teaching”. But where this negative form is used in MN 110, it has Asappuriso, bhikkhave, assaddhammasamannāgato hoti, which must mean “a bad person possesses an untrue teaching”. There, BB has “an untrue man is possessed of bad qualities” which agrees with the syntax I am proposing. Admittedly, there the context show dhamma must be “qualities”, while the association of dhamma here with savana shows that here it should be teachings. Similarly, below BB has “not associating with good persons” for asappurisesevana, but at SN 35.246 we have Asappurisasevito ceso maggo, na ceso maggo sappurisehi sevito. “This path is frequented by bad people, not by good people.”, which there BB translates as “This is a path followed by inferior people; it is not the path followed by superior people.”
