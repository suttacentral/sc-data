# NOTE: BB has “protected by their Dhamma”, with the note “protected by her co-religionists”. This is a surprisingly obscure detail, which I haven’t been able to source in the nikayas or their commentaries. However, the commentary to sanghadisesa 1 says: sagottehi pana sahadhammikehi ca ekaṃ satthāraṃ uddissa pabbajitehi ekagaṇapariyāpannehi ca rakkhitā so i guess this is where it stems from. It is possible, I guess, but it seems to me that the more obvious meaning would be that “dhamma” here simply means “what is right”.
