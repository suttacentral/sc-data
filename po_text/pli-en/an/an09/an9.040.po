# NOTE: I have no idea why BB translates “bent and twisted bundle of branches.” The “me” is supplied from the elephants reflection below. The point of this simile is that he, as tallest and strongest of the herd, pulls down the choice branches, but they eat them before he gets the chance. Here and above, pasuta is not “headed for” as in BB, but “engrossed in”. Otherwise the similes don’t make sense.
