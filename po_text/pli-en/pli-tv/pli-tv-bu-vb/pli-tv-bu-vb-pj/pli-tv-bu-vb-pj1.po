# NOTE: In Permutations part 1 above _magga_ is translated as “orifice,” here as “private part.” This follows from what appears to be a slightly different usage in the two sections. In the previous section _magga_ refers to the three orifices of the partner that a monk might have sexual intercourse with. In this section _magga_ seems to refer specifically to the genitals and the anus, whether of the partner or the monk, and the mouth would seem to be excluded. The mouth here seems to be represented by the Pali _amagga_, “non-path” or “non-private part.” This follows from the fact that in the _vinaya_ the anus is regularly called _vaccamagga_, “the path of feces,” and the genitals _passāvamagga_, “the path of urine.” The mouth, however, with the curious exception of the previous section, is never called _magga_. In this interpretation I follow BMC I, p.45.
