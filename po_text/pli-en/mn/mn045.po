# NOTE: Acc. to Ven Nyanatusita,"Thus it makes sense that the deity says that the termites could eat it. Perhaps even the whole seed was eaten since the Maloo Creeper, a member of the legume family, has a hard woody seed. It is eaten by forest people in India, supposedly after removing the skin. Termites do not carry away seeds like ants would do, they eat things at the spot. Besides this the seed is quite large. http://gardentia.net/2014/03/23/bauhinia-climber/ Thus udrabheyyuṃ is probably the right reading. It is supported by the commentary which glosses it as khādeyyuṃ.
