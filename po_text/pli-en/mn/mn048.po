# NOTE: Here I think the final -āya must be read as locative, as opposed to the more common dative as accepted by BB. Note that comm. here reads it as instrumental, i.e. “investigated with the knowledge of the realization of stream-entry.” The next sentence confirms that they already have stream-entry, so the dative is not appropriate.
