They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. "

# NOTE: niccabhikkha is a curious idiom, not, so far as I know, discussed in any available dictionary. In Ja 398 it refers to the daily offering of food to a yakkha, and this must be the early meaning. here and at SN 3.13 it is explicitly said to refer to money, so this must have evolved. the fact that Udena has to ask what kind of offering it is shows that it still might have meant food.
