That context draws out the slightly passive-aggressive nature of what Moggallana says here; he’s kind of praising him for having made merit, but also kind of criticizing him for living off his past. The verb sobhati in such cases is very idiomatic. Nyanatusita suggests “befits”, which apparently BB adopts in Connected Discourses. But I think the idea is that it looks nice for someone like Sakka (who is interested in such things).
