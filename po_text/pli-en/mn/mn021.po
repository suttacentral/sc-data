# NOTE: The grammar here is a little obscure, and the various translations evidence this. Chalmer’s is the only clearly correct one: the Buddha is applying the Golden rule, starting with the nuns, then to phagguna. Horner misses the shift in object and simply repeats verbatim. BB, following Nyanamoli, has “speaks dispraise in your presence”, without clarifying dispraise of who. But in the next passage, “you” is specified as object. In both passages, we should read tava (genitive) as playing the same role as bhikkhuninam in the former passages. The confusion comes because the genitive plays two roles in the passages, with sammukha and as the object of criticism/blows. These passages inherit tava as used in the former sense but apply it in the latter. In the next passage sammukha is omitted, presumably because it is unnecessary to specify being hit in your own presence.
