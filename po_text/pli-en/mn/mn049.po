# NOTE: Most translators take rittaka, tucchaka here to refer to Nibbana. But it seems to me likely it is referring to the Buddha’s speech. This is what comm. says: Mā heva te rittakamevaahositucchakameva ahosīti tuyhaṃ vacanaṃ rittakaṃ mā hotu, tucchakaṃ mā hotūti satthāraṃ musāvādena niggaṇhāti. When tucch-, ritt-are used together like this, they almost always refer to speech, in the context of a debate or controverted claim. (MN 61, MN 80, MN 99, and so on). Only rarely are they used in an ontological sense, as in SN 22.95 and SN 35.238. But these are not debates.
