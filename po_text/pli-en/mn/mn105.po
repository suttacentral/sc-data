# NOTE: The reading is problematic, and BB follows several manuscripts in omitting āneñjasaṃyojanena hi kho visaṃyutto. However, as the MS notes, it is commented on: Āneñjasaṃyojanena hi kho visaṃyuttoti āneñjasamāpattisaṃyojanena visaṃsaṭṭho. But the idea that such a person is genuinely detached from the anenja cannot be right. I suspect there was an old confused reading, and that this line connects back to the immediately prior anenjapatisamyutta. i.e. they’re not detached from the “fetter” of the anenja, but from “what is connected with” the anenja, i.e. the talk, etc. as discussed earlier.
