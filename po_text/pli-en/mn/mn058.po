# NOTE: BB has “no one-sided answer” which is overly literal, as one-sided has a negative connotation. In AN 3.78 he renders the same phrase “Not exclusively so”, while in AN 3.21 he has “definitive declaration about this matter.” It seems to me that the point of the idiom is not that a definitive answer cannot be made, for the texts do in fact go on to do just that. Rather, it is that a proper answer is complex, and cannot be answered simply.
