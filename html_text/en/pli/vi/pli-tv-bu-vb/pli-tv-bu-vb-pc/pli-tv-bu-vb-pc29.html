<h1>Monks’ Confession 29: the training rule on what is got prepared</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2><h3>First sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.29.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.295"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="629"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time the nun Thullanandā was associating with a family from which she received a regular meal.</p>
<p>On one occasion the head of that family had invited some senior monks. Just then, the nun Thullanandā robed up in the morning, took her bowl and robe, and went to that family. And she asked the head of the family, “Why have you prepared so much food?”</p>
<p>“Because, Venerable, I’ve invited the senior monks.”</p>
<p>“But who are those senior monks?”</p>
<p>“Venerable Sāriputta, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, Venerable Mahākaccāna, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika, Venerable Mahākappina, Venerable Mahācunda, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, Venerable Upāli, Venerable Ānanda, and Venerable Rāhula.”</p>
<p><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.296"></a> “But why do you invite such inferior monks instead of the great ones?”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="630"></a> “Who are these great monks?” “Venerable Devadatta, Venerable Kokālika, Venerable Kaṭamodakatissaka, Venerable Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Venerable Samuddadatta.”</p>
<p>While this conversation was still taking place, the senior monks entered. Thullanandā said, “Is it true that you’ve invited these great monks?”</p>
<p>“Just before you called them inferior monks, and now you call them great monks.” And that lay person threw her out of the house and made an end of her regular meal.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="3"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="631"></a> The monks of few desires … grumbled and complained, “How can Devadatta eat almsfood knowing that a nun got it prepared?” … “Is it true, Devadatta, that you did this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “… Foolish man, how can you eat almsfood knowing that a nun got it prepared? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h3>Preliminary ruling</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="4"></a><a class="pts-vp-pli" id="pts-vp-pli4.67"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="632"></a><a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.297"></a><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk eats almsfood knowing that a nun got it prepared, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong></p>
<p class="endsection"><a class="sc" id="5"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="633"></a> In this way the Master laid down this training rule for the monks.</p>
<h3>Second sub-story</h3>
<p><a class="sc" id="6"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.29.2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="634"></a> Soon afterwards a monk who had earlier left Rājagaha returned to see his family. Because it was long since he had last returned, people prepared food to honor him. And the nun who was associating with that family said to them, “Give food to that monk.” The monk thought, “The Master has prohibited us from eating almsfood when we know that a nun got it prepared,” and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept it. And because he was not able to walk for alms, he missed his meal.</p>
<p>After returning to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened,<a class="wt-pa" id="635"></a> and they in turn told the Master.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="7"></a> Soon afterwards the Master gave a teaching and addressed the monks,<strong class="rule"> “Monks, I allow you to eat almsfood knowing that a nun got it prepared if the lay person had already intended to prepare it.</strong> ” And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="8"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="636"></a> <span class="var" hidden>gihisamārambhā → gihīsamārambhā (bj)</span><strong class="rule"> ‘If a monk eats almsfood knowing that a nun got it prepared, unless the lay person had already intended to prepare it, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”</strong> </p>
