<h1>7.1 Of the Classification <span class='add'>of things</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc195' href='#pc195'></a>: That things cannot be grouped together by means of abstract ideas.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.1' href='#pts-cs7.1.1'>PTS cs 7.1.1</a>But you do not also deny that any things may combine or be included with other things under a concept of totality or universality. Hence, how can you deny that they may be grouped together? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.2' href='#pts-cs7.1.2'>PTS cs 7.1.2</a> The organs of sense <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.3' href='#pts-cs7.1.3'>PTS cs 7.1.3</a> and their objects are, you admit, computed under the material aggregate <span class='add'>of a living individual</span>. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.4' href='#pts-cs7.1.4'>PTS cs 7.1.4</a> Pleasant, painful, or neutral feelings are computed under the aggregate of feeling. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.5' href='#pts-cs7.1.5'>PTS cs 7.1.5</a> Percepts on occasion of sense and ideation come under the aggregate of perception. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.6' href='#pts-cs7.1.6'>PTS cs 7.1.6</a> Volitions on occasion of sense and ideation come under the aggregate of conscious concomitants. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.7' href='#pts-cs7.1.7'>PTS cs 7.1.7</a> Consciousness on occasion of sense and ideation comes under the aggregate of consciousness. Hence, by admitting these inclusions, you must admit that things may be grouped by an idea.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika, Siddhatthika:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc196' href='#pc196'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.1.8' href='#pts-cs7.1.8'>PTS cs 7.1.8</a>Then <span class='add'>you</span> understand “things being grouped together by ideas” in the same way as two bullocks may be grouped together by a rope or a yoke, an alms-bowl may be held together by a suspender, a dog may be held in by a leash?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <span class='add'>Yes; and</span> hence it is not less right to say that some things may be grouped together by other things (ideas).</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. First published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by <span class='editor'>Manfred Wierich</span> and <span class='editor'>Ven. Vimala</span> and proofread by <span class='editor'>Josephine Anderson</span>. Some changes were introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbreviations, i.e., those of cited works and the participants in the controversies, were expanded.</li>
<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
<li>The corrigenda were merged into the text. Some could not be resolved, though.</li>
