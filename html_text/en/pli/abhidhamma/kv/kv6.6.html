<h1>6.6 Of Space</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc192' href='#pc192'></a>: That space is unconditioned.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.6.1' href='#pts-cs6.6.1'>PTS cs 6.6.1</a>If space is unconditioned, as you affirm, you must class it with <i>Nibbāna</i>, or you must affirm two [sorts</p>
<p>of] unconditioned—and so two <i>Nibbānas</i>—all of which you deny … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.6.2' href='#pts-cs6.6.2'>PTS cs 6.6.2</a>Can anyone make space where there has been no space? Then one can make that which is conditioned unconditioned—which you deny … So, too, for the reverse process … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.6.3' href='#pts-cs6.6.3'>PTS cs 6.6.3</a>Again, if you admit that birds go through space, moon, sun, and stars go through space, supernormal movement is worked in space, the arm or hand is waved in space, clods, clubs, a supernormally moved person, arrows are projected through space, you must state as much about movement through or in the unconditioned—which you cannot … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.6.4' href='#pts-cs6.6.4'>PTS cs 6.6.4</a>Again, if people enclose space when they make houses or barns, do they enclose the unconditioned? Or when a well is dug, does non-space become space? Yes? Then does the unconditioned become conditioned? Or, when an empty well, or an empty barn, or an empty jar, is filled, does “space” disappear? If so, does the unconditioned disappear?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka, Mahiṁsāsaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.6.5' href='#pts-cs6.6.5'>PTS cs 6.6.5</a>If then it is wrong to say space is unconditioned, is it conditioned? You deny. Then it must be unconditioned.</p>
