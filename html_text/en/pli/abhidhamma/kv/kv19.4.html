<h1>19.4 Of Attainment (<i>patti</i>)</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That attainment is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.1' href='#pts-cs19.4.1'>PTS cs 19.4.1</a><span class='pe'><em>Is similar to <a class='cr' href='/kv19.3/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs19.3.1'>Kv 19.3 PTS CS 19.3.1</a> in the foregoing</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.2-4' href='#pts-cs19.4.2-4'>PTS cs 19.4.2–4</a>Again, do you imply that the winning <span class='add'>through gifts</span> of raiment, almsfood, lodging, medicine, is unconditioned? But if so, the same difficulty arises as in the case of attainment in general (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs19.4.1'>PTS CS 19.4.1</a>). In fact, you would have in these four and <i>Nibbāna</i> five “unconditioneds”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.5-6' href='#pts-cs19.4.5-6'>PTS cs 19.4.5–6</a>A similar argument is used for the winning of any of the Rūpa <i>Jhāna</i>s (4), or of the Arūpa <i>Jhāna</i>s (4), or of the Four Paths and Four Fruits, concluding with: In fact, you would have in these eight and <i>Nibbāna</i> nine “unconditioneds”, etc.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc338' href='#pc338'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.4.7' href='#pts-cs19.4.7'>PTS cs 19.4.7</a>But if I am wrong, can you identify winning with any one of the five aggregates, bodily or mental?</p>
<p>If not, then it is unconditioned.</p>
