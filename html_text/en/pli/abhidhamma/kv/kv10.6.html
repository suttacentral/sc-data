<h1>10.6 Of Two Codes of Morals</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc248' href='#pc248'></a>: That one who is engaged in the Path is practising a double morality.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.6.1' href='#pts-cs10.6.1'>PTS cs 10.6.1</a>You must then be prepared to affirm that he is possessed of his dual morality with a dual mental contact, dual feeling, dual perception, dual volition, dual thought, dual faith, dual energy, dual mindfulness, dual concentration, dual understanding …<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.6.2' href='#pts-cs10.6.2'>PTS cs 10.6.2</a> If his moral code be worldly, those processes will be worldly. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.6.3' href='#pts-cs10.6.3'>PTS cs 10.6.3</a> If his moral code be both, they will be double. The mental contact, the feeling, etc., that he experiences, will be both worldly as well as unworldly <span class='add'>or supramundane</span>—which you of course deny … .</p>
<p>And if you say that one actually engaged on the Path is possessed of a worldly code of morals, you are calling such an one in effect an average person or worldling—which you of course refuse to do … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.6.4-6' href='#pts-cs10.6.4-6'>PTS cs 10.6.4–6</a>Your position, you say, is this: (1) one actually engaged on the Path practises a worldly morality in the three factors relating to conduct—right speech, right action, right livelihood—but not in the five factors relating to mental life. (2) In those three factors his morals are both worldly and supramundane, but they are only the latter in the other five factors. My position is that you must affirm one and the same higher morality for all the eight.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahāsaṅghika:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc249' href='#pc249'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.6.7' href='#pts-cs10.6.7'>PTS cs 10.6.7</a>Well, but does the Path come to be when worldly morality has ceased?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahāsaṅghika:</span> What! can anyone without morals—his virtue defective, imperfect, cut off—develop the Path?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said … .</p>
