<h1>18.5 Of a One and Only Path</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the fourfold fruition of the religious life is realized by one path only.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.5.1' href='#pts-cs18.5.1'>PTS cs 18.5.1</a>This implies a fusion of the four distinct conscious procedures <span class='add'>experienced in each stage of progress</span>, which you deny.</p>
<p>Moreover, if there be one path only, which of the four is it?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Uttarāpathaka:</span> The path of Arahantship.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But do we teach that by that path the three first of the ten Fetters are removed—to wit, theory of soul, doubt, and infection of mere rule and ritual? Did not the Exalted One say that these are removed by the Stream-Winning Path?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.5.2' href='#pts-cs18.5.2'>PTS cs 18.5.2</a>And are gross passions and malevolence removed by the path of Arahantship? Did not the Exalted One say that the fruit of the Once-Returner was the state of having reduced these to a minimum? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.5.3' href='#pts-cs18.5.3'>PTS cs 18.5.3</a> And is it by the path of Arahantship that that minimum is removed? You know it is not. If you assent, I can refer you to the words of the Exalted One, who said that the fruit of the Never-Returner was the state of having removed that minimum without remainder.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.5.4' href='#pts-cs18.5.4'>PTS cs 18.5.4</a>But if we are wrong, and the Exalted One developed each Path in succession, can he be called Stream-Winner and so on? You deny, but you have implied it.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.5.5' href='#pts-cs18.5.5'>PTS cs 18.5.5</a>But if the Exalted One realized these four fruits of the religious life by one Ariyan Path only, and the disciples by four Paths, they have seen what he did not see, they arrive at where he did not arrive, they realize that which he did not realize. You cannot admit this … .</p>
