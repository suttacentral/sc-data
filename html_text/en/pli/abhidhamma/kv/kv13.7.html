<h1>13.7 Of <i>Jhāna</i> as Enjoyment</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the expert enjoys <i>Jhāna</i>, and the desire for <i>Jhāna</i> has <i>Jhāna</i> as its object.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.7.1' href='#pts-cs13.7.1'>PTS cs 13.7.1</a>Do you mean that a given <i>Jhāna</i> is the mental object to that same <i>Jhāna</i>? If you deny, your proposition falls. If you assent, you must equally admit that he touches a given mental contact with the same contact, feels a given feeling with that feeling, and so on for perception, volition, thought, applied and sustained intellection, zest, mindfulness, understanding … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.7.2' href='#pts-cs13.7.2'>PTS cs 13.7.2</a>You admit that desire for <i>Jhāna</i> and <i>Jhāna</i> itself are forms of conscious experience? But are you prepared to admit further that they constitute two conscious processes going on at once? You deny; then your former admission is invalid. And if you admit further that desire for <i>Jhāna</i> is wrong while <i>Jhāna</i> itself is good, you bring the good and the bad up against each other in the same consciousness—things as “far apart as earth and sky”, etc.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.7.3' href='#pts-cs13.7.3'>PTS cs 13.7.3</a>But, if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a <i>bhikkhu</i> who, aloof from sensuous ideas, aloof from evil ideas, entering into, abides in First <i>Jhāna</i>: he enjoys it, he yearns over it, and by it he is delighted”?</p>
<p>Hence surely the expert enjoys <i>Jhāna</i>, and the desire for <i>Jhāna</i> has <i>Jhāna</i> as a mental object.</p>
