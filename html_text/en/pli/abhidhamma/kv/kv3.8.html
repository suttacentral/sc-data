<h1>3.8 Of the Celestial Ear</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc151' href='#pc151'></a>: That the fleshly ear, when it is the medium of an idea, is the celestial ear.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.8.1-2' href='#pts-cs3.8.1-2'>PTS cs 3.8.1–2</a><span class='add'>correspond exactly to the same sections in</span> <a class='cr' href='/kv3.7/en/aung-rhysdavids'>Kv 3.7</a>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.8.3' href='#pts-cs3.8.3'>PTS cs 3.8.3</a>Further, you are, by your proposition, also admitting that the celestial ear, when it is the medium of a <span class='add'>sensuous</span> idea, becomes the fleshly ear. Further, you are also admitting that there is only one ear, or sense of hearing. If you deny, you cannot maintain your proposition. If you assent, I would ask whether the Exalted One did not speak of two ears—the fleshly ear and the heavenly ear?</p>
