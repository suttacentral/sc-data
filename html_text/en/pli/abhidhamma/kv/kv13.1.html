<h1>13.1 Of Age-Long Penalty</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.1' href='#pts-cs13.1'>PTS cs 13.1</a><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc272' href='#pc272'></a>: That one doomed to age-long retribution must endure it for a whole <i>kappa</i>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But this implies that the cycle may start when a Buddha is born into the world, or when the Order is dissolved, or when the condemned person is committing the act incurring the penalty, or when he is dying … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.1.2' href='#pts-cs13.1.2'>PTS cs 13.1.2</a>It also implies that if he live for a past <i>kappa</i>, he may live for a future one—nay, for two, three, or four … .</p>
<p>And if during his <i>kappa</i> there be a cosmic conflagration, whither will he go?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika:</span> To another plane of the universe.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Do the dead go thither? Do they go to the sky?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika:</span> The dead go.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Can the act involving the penalty take effect in a subsequent life? You must deny … Hence he must go to the sky. This implies that he has the gift of <i>iddhi</i>—<a class='pc' id='pc273' href='#pc273'></a>else he could not. Now can one doomed to age-long retribution practise the four steps to <i>Iddhi</i>—will, effort, thought, investigation? … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.1.3' href='#pts-cs13.1.3'>PTS cs 13.1.3</a>But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Doomed to the Waste, to purgatorial woe<br>
For age-long penalties, provoking schism.<br>
Of discord fain, fixed in unrighteousness.<br>
From the sure haven doth he fall away,<br>
Breaking the concord of the Brotherhood,<br>
Age-long in purgat'ry he waxeth ripe”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence my proposition is true.</p>
