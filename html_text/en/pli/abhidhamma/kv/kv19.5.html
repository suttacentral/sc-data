<h1>19.5 Of “Thusness”</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the fundamental characteristics of all things (<i>sabba-dhamma</i>) are unconditioned.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.5.1' href='#pts-cs19.5.1'>PTS cs 19.5.1</a>Do you then identify those fundamental characteristics or “thusness” with <i>Nibbāna</i>, the Shelter … the Goal, the Past-deceased, the Ambrosial? Or are there two “unconditioneds”? You deny both alternatives <span class='add'>but you must assent to one or the other</span>. If to the latter, I ask, are there two kinds of Shelters and so on? And is there a boundary or … interstice between them?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.5.2' href='#pts-cs19.5.2'>PTS cs 19.5.2</a>Again, assuming a materiality (<i>rūpatā</i>) of matter or body, is not materiality unconditioned? You assent. Then I raise the same difficulties as before.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.5.3' href='#pts-cs19.5.3'>PTS cs 19.5.3</a>I raise them, too, if you admit a “hedonality” of feeling, a “perceivability” of perception, a <i>saṅkhāratā</i> or <a class='pc' id='pc339' href='#pc339'></a> co-efficiency of mental coefficients, a consciousness of being conscious. If all these be unconditioned, are there then six categories of “unconditioneds”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.5.4' href='#pts-cs19.5.4'>PTS cs 19.5.4</a>But if I am wrong, is the “thusness” of all things the five aggregates <span class='add'>taken together</span>?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> Then that “thusness” of all things is unconditioned.</p>
