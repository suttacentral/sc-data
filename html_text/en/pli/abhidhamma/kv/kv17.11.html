<h1>17.11 Of the Sanctification of the Gift</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That a gift is sanctified by the giver only, not by the recipient.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.11.1' href='#pts-cs17.11.1'>PTS cs 17.11.1</a>Now are not some who receive gifts “worthy of offerings, attentions, gifts, salutations, the world's supreme field of merit”? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.11.2' href='#pts-cs17.11.2'>PTS cs 17.11.2</a> And did not the Exalted One pronounce the four pairs of men, the eight kinds of individuals to be worthy of gifts? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.11.3' href='#pts-cs17.11.3'>PTS cs 17.11.3</a> And are there not those who, having offered a gift to a Stream-Winner, Once-Returner, Never-Returner or Arahant, make the gift effective? How then can you maintain your proposition?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.11.4' href='#pts-cs17.11.4'>PTS cs 17.11.4</a>But if a gift may be sanctified by the recipient, does not he become the agent for quite a different person? Does not one person work the happiness or the misery of another? Does not one sow, another reap?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Now was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“There are four ways, Ānanda, of sanctifying a gift. Which are the four? A gift may be sanctified by the giver, not by the recipient; a gift may be sanctified by the recipient, not by the giver; or it may be sanctified by both; or, again, by neither”?</p>
<p>Hence it is surely wrong to say: “A gift is sanctified only by the giver, not by the recipient”.</p>
