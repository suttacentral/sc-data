<h1>14.4 Of the Outward Life of an Ariyan</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the Ariyan “forms” <span class='add'>of speech and action</span> are derived from the four primary qualities of matter.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc287' href='#pc287'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.4.1' href='#pts-cs14.4.1'>PTS cs 14.4.1</a>You admit that the qualities of the Ariyan are moral, and not unmoral. But the primary qualities of matter are not moral; they are unmoral … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.4.2' href='#pts-cs14.4.2'>PTS cs 14.4.2</a>Again, there is in these primary qualities nothing akin to the absence of intoxicant, fetter, tie, flood, bond, hindrance, infection, grasping, corruption, characteristic of the Ariyan's qualities. On the contrary, the former are concomitant with these <span class='add'>ethically undesirable things.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.4.3' href='#pts-cs14.4.3'>PTS cs 14.4.3</a>But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Whatever matter there is, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is the four primary qualities and their derivatives”.</p>
<p>Hence it is surely right to say that the material qualities of the Ariyan are derived from the primary qualities.</p>
