<h1>10.2 Of the Path and Bodily Form</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the physical frame of one who is practising the Eightfold Path is included in that Path.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.2.1' href='#pts-cs10.2.1'>PTS cs 10.2.1</a>You must then be prepared to affirm also that bodily form is <span class='add'>like the Path-factors</span> subjective, having the mental attributes of adverting, ideating, co-ordinated application, attending, volition, anticipating, aiming. You deny this and rightly, for surely the opposite is true.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.2.2-3' href='#pts-cs10.2.2-3'>PTS cs 10.2.2–3</a>The three factors of the Path <span class='add'>in which you deem things corporeal to be included</span>—supremely right speech, action, livelihood—these, you affirm, are not subjective, not having the mental attributes above-named. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.2.4-5' href='#pts-cs10.2.4-5'>PTS cs 10.2.4–5</a> But the other five factors of the Path—supremely right views, aspiration, endeavour, mindfulness, concentration—these, you admit, are subjective, and have the mental attributes above-named.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.2.6-7' href='#pts-cs10.2.6-7'>PTS cs 10.2.6–7</a>If you affirm the absence of these mental characteristics from those three factors of the Path, you must also affirm their absence from all these five factors of the Path.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahiṁsāsaka, Sammitiya, Mahāsaṅghika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.2.8' href='#pts-cs10.2.8'>PTS cs 10.2.8</a>But you admit that supremely right <a class='pc' id='pc245' href='#pc245'></a> speech, action, and livelihood are factors of the Path, <span class='add'>and these are manifestations of corporeality</span>. Surely then the practiser's physical frame is included in the Path.</p>
