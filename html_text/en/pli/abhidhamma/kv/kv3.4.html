<h1>3.4 Of Emancipation as a Process</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That spiritual emancipation is a <span class='add'>gradual</span> process of becoming free.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.1' href='#pts-cs3.4.1'>PTS cs 3.4.1</a>If your proposition is to stand, you must affirm also that such a mind is then in part freed, in part not. And if you assent to the second proposition, you must admit that your subject is part Stream-Winner, part not—in other words, that he has all the attributes of the Stream-Winner in part only.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.2-4' href='#pts-cs3.4.2-4'>PTS cs 3.4.2–4</a>The same argument holds for the other three Paths.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.5' href='#pts-cs3.4.5'>PTS cs 3.4.5</a>You must also affirm as to whether <span class='add'>each conscious unit</span> is emancipated at the moment of its genesis, and in process of being emancipated as it ceases … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Opponent:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.6' href='#pts-cs3.4.6'>PTS cs 3.4.6</a><a class='pc' id='pc146' href='#pc146'></a>You do not assent to my proposition; but was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“For him who thus knows, thus sees, the heart is set free from the intoxicants of sense-desires, of becoming, and of ignorance”?</p>
<p>Is there no “being emancipated” here of the emancipated mind?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.7' href='#pts-cs3.4.7'>PTS cs 3.4.7</a>But is there not also a Suttanta in which the Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“With heart thus made serene, made wholly pure, and very clean, freed from lust and from defilement, become pliant, ready to work and imperturbable, he bends over the mind to insight in the destruction of intoxicants”?</p>
<p>There is no process here of being set free.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.4.8' href='#pts-cs3.4.8'>PTS cs 3.4.8</a>You would not speak of a mind partially lusting, hating, being bewildered, being corrupted. How can you then maintain your proposition? Would you not say <span class='add'>straight away</span> that the mind is lustful or not, malevolent or not, confused or not, suspended or not, destroyed or not, finished or not?</p>
