<h1>3.6 Of the Controlling Powers of the Eighth Man</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the five controlling powers are absent in a person of the Eighth Stage.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.1' href='#pts-cs3.6.1'>PTS cs 3.6.1</a>You must deny him faith, if you deny in him the controlling power of faith. So also for the other four. But you will not go as far as that. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.2' href='#pts-cs3.6.2'>PTS cs 3.6.2</a> Contrariwise, you do allow that he <span class='add'>as Eighth Man</span> has faith and the rest, but you go no further. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.3' href='#pts-cs3.6.3'>PTS cs 3.6.3</a> Yet you are prepared to admit, with respect to other controlling powers—<span class='add'>e.g.</span>, mind, gladness, etc.… and psychic life—that whoso has the attribute, has also the controlling power of it. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.4' href='#pts-cs3.6.4'>PTS cs 3.6.4</a> Why draw the line at those five? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.5-6' href='#pts-cs3.6.5-6'>PTS cs 3.6.5–6</a> as, in fact, you do.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.7' href='#pts-cs3.6.7'>PTS cs 3.6.7</a>You contend that, whereas the controlling power of faith is absent in him, faith itself is not absent. That whereas the controlling powers of energy, mindfulness, concentration, and reason are absent in him, he is neither indolent, nor heedless, nor unsteady or mentally vacillating, nor stupid, nor deaf, nor dumb.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.8' href='#pts-cs3.6.8'>PTS cs 3.6.8</a>You acknowledge that his faith, energy, etc., are <span class='add'>of the saving kind called</span> forth-leading, yet you do not credit him with the controlling powers <span class='add'>in which such attributes consist.</span></p>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc140' href='#pc140'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.9-12' href='#pts-cs3.6.9-12'>PTS cs 3.6.9–12</a>You admit the attainment both of the attributes and of these five controlling powers in the person who is practising that he may realize the fruit of Once-Returning, of Never-Returning, of Arahantship, but you deny the latter for the Eighth Man alone; the one goes with the other!</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.6.13' href='#pts-cs3.6.13'>PTS cs 3.6.13</a>Finally, is there not a Suttanta in which the Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“The five controlling powers, <i>bhikkhus</i>—which are they? The controlling powers that are faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, understanding. From the completion and perfection of these five, a man becomes Arahant. Held in a weaker degree, the holder becomes one who is practising that he may realize the Fruit of Arahantship; in a yet weaker degree the holder becomes a Never-Returner; in a yet weaker degree, one who is practising that he may realize the Fruit of Never-Returning; in a yet weaker degree, a Once-Returner; in a yet weaker degree, one who is practising that he may realize the Fruit of Once-Returning; in a yet weaker degree, a Stream-Winner; in a yet weaker degree, one who is practising that he may realize the Fruit of Stream-Winning. In whom these five controlling powers are in every way, and everywhere wholly absent, he, I declare, is one who stands without, in the ranks of the average man”?</p>
<p>Yet you would not say that the Eighth Man stood thus without? Hence you must concede that the five controlling powers are present in him.</p>
