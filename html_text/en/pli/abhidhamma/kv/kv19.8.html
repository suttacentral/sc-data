<h1>19.8 Of the Moral Controlling Powers</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc342' href='#pc342'></a>: That the five moral controlling powers—faith, effort, mindfulness, concentration, understanding—are not valid as “controlling powers” in worldly matters.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.8.1' href='#pts-cs19.8.1'>PTS cs 19.8.1</a>Do you imply that there can be no faith, or effort, or mindfulness, or concentration, or understanding in worldly concerns? You deny. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.8.2' href='#pts-cs19.8.2'>PTS cs 19.8.2</a> On the other hand, you maintain that there is faith, etc., in such a connection, but that none of them avail for moral control.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.8.3' href='#pts-cs19.8.3'>PTS cs 19.8.3</a>You admit that both mind and mind as a controlling power are valid in worldly matters. And you admit a similar validity in both joy and joy as a controlling power, in both psychic life and psychic life as a controlling power.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.8.4' href='#pts-cs19.8.4'>PTS cs 19.8.4</a>Why then exempt those five?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.8.5' href='#pts-cs19.8.5'>PTS cs 19.8.5</a>Again, you admit that there is both a spiritual faith and a controlling power of that faith—why not both a worldly faith and a worldly controlling power of faith? And so for the rest. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.8.6' href='#pts-cs19.8.6'>PTS cs 19.8.6</a> Why accept in the one case, deny in the other?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.8.7' href='#pts-cs19.8.7'>PTS cs 19.8.7</a>Moreover, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“And I, <i>bhikkhus</i>, with the eyes of a Buddha surveying the world, saw beings living whose vision was dim with dust, in some but slightly, greatly in others, beings whose faculties were here keen, there blunt, of good disposition … apt to learn … some among them discerning the danger and defect of <span class='add'>rebirth in</span> other worlds”?</p>
<p>Surely then the five moral controlling powers are valid in worldly matters.</p>
