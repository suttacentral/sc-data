<h1>8.2 Of an Intermediate State</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc212' href='#pc212'></a>: That there is an intermediate state of existence.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.1' href='#pts-cs8.2.1'>PTS cs 8.2.1</a>If there be such a state, you must identify it with either the Kāma-life, or Rūpa-life, or Arūpa-life, which you refuse to do … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.2' href='#pts-cs8.2.2'>PTS cs 8.2.2</a>You deny that there is an intermediate state between the first and second, or the second and third, of these …<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.3' href='#pts-cs8.2.3'>PTS cs 8.2.3</a> you affirm, indeed, that there is no such thing; how then can you maintain your proposition?</p>
<p>Is<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.4' href='#pts-cs8.2.4'>PTS cs 8.2.4</a> it a fifth matrix, a sixth destiny, an eighth station for reborn consciousness, a tenth realm of beings? Is it a mode of living, a destiny, a realm of beings, a renewal of life, a matrix, a station of consciousness, an acquiring of individuality? Is there <i>karma</i> leading to it? Are there beings who approach thither? Do beings get born in it, grow old, die in it, decease from it, and get reborn from it? Do the five aggregates exist in it? Is it a five-mode existence? All this you deny. How then can you maintain your proposition?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.5-7' href='#pts-cs8.2.5-7'>PTS cs 8.2.5–7</a>You admit that every one of these <span class='add'>categories or notions</span> applies to each of the three planes of life named above, the only difference being that the first two—<i>Kāma</i>-life and <i>Rūpa</i>-life—are five-mode existences; the last—<a class='pc' id='pc213' href='#pc213'></a>Arūpa-life—is a four-mode existence (that is, without material qualities). If then there is an intermediate stage of life, you must be able to predicate some or all of these <span class='add'>notions or categories</span> of it. But you say you cannot … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.8' href='#pts-cs8.2.8'>PTS cs 8.2.8</a>But you deny also that there is an intermediate life for all beings. Hence your proposition is not universally valid.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.9-11' href='#pts-cs8.2.9-11'>PTS cs 8.2.9–11</a>For whom then do you deny the intermediate state? For the person whose retribution is immediate? If you assent, to that extent your proposition is for you not true. Or is it for the person whose retribution is not immediate that you affirm this state? Yes, you say. Then you must deny it for his opposite.</p>
<p>You deny it also for one who is to be reborn in purgatory, in the sphere of unconscious beings, in the immaterial</p>
<p>heavens. Therefore to that extent your proposition is not universally valid. Nevertheless, you maintain that there</p>
<p>is an intermediate stage of life for one whose retribution is not immediate, for one who is not to be reborn in purgatory, nor among the “unconscious beings”, nor in the immaterial heavens. <span class='add'>Concerning these you have yet to state in what respect, as a plane of life, it resembles, or differs from, the three named by the Exalted One.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya, Sammitiya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.12' href='#pts-cs8.2.12'>PTS cs 8.2.12</a>But are there not beings who “complete existence within the first half of the term”? If so, are we not right?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.2.13' href='#pts-cs8.2.13'>PTS cs 8.2.13</a>Granted that there are such beings, is there a separate interval-<span class='add'>state</span> <span class='add'>between any two recognized existences</span>? Yes, you say. But granted that there are beings who “complete existence within the second half of the term”, is there a separate state of life corresponding thereto? If you deny, you must also deny your proposition <span class='add'>since you rest it on this basis</span>.</p>
<p>The same argument applies to such cognate terms as “beings who complete existence without”, and again, “with difficulty and striving”.</p>
