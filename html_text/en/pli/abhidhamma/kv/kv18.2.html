<h1>18.2 Of how the Norm was taught</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That it is not right to say “The Exalted Buddha himself taught the Norm”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.2.1' href='#pts-cs18.2.1'>PTS cs 18.2.1</a>By whom then was it taught?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Vetulyaka:</span> By the special creation.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Then must this created thing have been the Conqueror, the Master, the Buddha Supreme, the Omni<a class='pc' id='pc325' href='#pc325'></a>scient, All-seeing, Lord of all things, Judge of Appeal of all things!… .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.2.2' href='#pts-cs18.2.2'>PTS cs 18.2.2</a>I ask again: By whom was the Norm taught?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Vetulyaka:</span> By the venerable Ānanda.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Then must he too have been the Conqueror, the Master, etc.? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.2.3' href='#pts-cs18.2.3'>PTS cs 18.2.3</a> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Sāriputta, I may teach the Norm concisely and I may teach it in detail, and I may teach it both ways. It is only they who understand that are hard to find”?</p>
<p>Hence surely the Buddha himself taught the Norm.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.2.4' href='#pts-cs18.2.4'>PTS cs 18.2.4</a>And again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“By the higher knowledge, <i>bhikkhus</i>, do I teach the Norm, not without the higher knowledge; a Norm with <span class='add'>reference to</span> cause do I teach, not one without; a wonder-working Norm do I teach, and none not wonder-working. And that I, <i>bhikkhus</i>, thus teach the Norm, a homily should be made, instruction should be given, to wit, let this, <i>bhikkhus</i>, suffice for your content, let this suffice for your satisfaction and for your gladness: the Exalted One is Buddha Supreme! the Norm is well revealed! the Order is well trained! Now when this declaration was uttered, ten thousand world-systems trembled”?</p>
<p>Hence surely the Exalted Buddha himself taught the Norm.</p>
