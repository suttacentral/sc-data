<h1>5.4 Of Assurance</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That one who has not made sure has the insight for entering the Path of Assurance.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.4.1' href='#pts-cs5.4.1'>PTS cs 5.4.1</a>If one who has not made sure has the insight for entering the Path of Assurance, then his opposite—one who has made sure—must have the insight for <em>not</em> entering it. If you deny, your proposition falls through. If, by it, you maintain that one who <i>has</i> made sure has <em>not</em> the insight for <em>not</em> entering that Path, then you imply that one who has <em>not</em> made sure has <em>not</em> the insight for entering thereon. Which, by your proposition, is wrong.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.4.2' href='#pts-cs5.4.2'>PTS cs 5.4.2</a>Again, if one who has not made sure has the insight for entering the Path of Assurance, do you then admit that one who has made sure is in the same intellectual stage? You deny. And if you admit, on the contrary, that one who has made sure has not <span class='add'>i.e., no longer</span> the insight <a class='pc' id='pc178' href='#pc178'></a> for entering, then you must surely deny that insight also to one who has not made sure.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.4.3' href='#pts-cs5.4.3'>PTS cs 5.4.3</a>Again, in affirming that one who has not made sure has the insight for entering the Path of Assurance, do you admit that he has also the insight for not entering it? You deny, that is, you affirm he has <em>not</em> the insight for not entering it. Do you equally admit then that he has <em>not</em> the insight for entering it? You deny … .</p>
<p>Does<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.4.4' href='#pts-cs5.4.4'>PTS cs 5.4.4</a> your proposition mean that there is a Path of Assurance for one who has not made sure of entering? You deny. Yet you admit that there is insight for entering upon it! Does this insight consist in applications of mindfulness and all the other factors of Enlightenment? You must deny, and <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.4.5' href='#pts-cs5.4.5'>PTS cs 5.4.5</a> affirm that there is no such Assurance. How then can your proposition stand?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.4.6' href='#pts-cs5.4.6'>PTS cs 5.4.6</a>You do not grant to one who is only in the prior stage of adoption the insight of the First Path? Or to one who is practising for the insight of the First … Fourth Fruition the insight of that Fruition? How then can you allow the insight of entering on the Path of Assurance to one who has not made sure?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.4.7' href='#pts-cs5.4.7'>PTS cs 5.4.7</a>If I am wrong, you must on the other hand admit that the Exalted One knows that a person, M or N, will enter the true Path of Assurance, and is capable of penetrating the Truths.</p>
