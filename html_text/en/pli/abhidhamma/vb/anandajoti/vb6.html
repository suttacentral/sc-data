<h2>1. The Section Derived from the Discourses</h2>
<h3>1.0. <span class='add'>The Outline of Conditional Origination</span></h3>
<p><a class='ref ba' id='ba180' href='#ba180'>BA 180</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli135' href='#pts-vp-pli135'>PTS vp 135</a> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs225' href='#pts-cs225'>PTS cs 225</a> With ignorance as condition there are (volitional) processes, with (volitional) processes as condition: consciousness, with consciousness as condition: mind and bodily form, with mind and bodily form as condition: the six sense spheres, with the six sense spheres as condition: contact, with contact as condition: feeling, with feeling as condition: craving, with craving as condition: attachment, with attachment as condition: continuation, with continuation as condition: birth, with birth as condition: ageing, death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow and despair (all) arise, and so there is an origination of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<h3>1.1. <span class='add'>Definition of Ignorance</span></h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs226' href='#pts-cs226'>PTS cs 226</a> Herein, what is ‘<span class='term'>ignorance</span>?’</p>
<p>Not knowing suffering, not knowing the origination of suffering, not knowing the cessation of suffering, not knowing the path leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>This is called ‘<span class='term'>ignorance</span>’.</p>
<h3>1.2. <span class='add'>Definition of (Volitional) Processes</span></h3>
<p>Herein, what is ‘<span class='term'>with ignorance as condition there are (volitional) processes</span>?’</p>
<p>(There is) a meritorious (volitional) process, a demeritorious (volitional) process, an imperturbable (volitional) process, a (volitional) process expressed by way of the body, a (volitional) process expressed by way of speech, a (volitional) process expressed by way of the mind.</p>
<p>Herein, what is a meritorious (volitional) process?</p>
<p>(There are) wholesome intentions in the sense-world sphere, in the form-world sphere, consisting of generosity, consisting of morality, consisting of meditation, this is said to be a meritorious (volitional) process.</p>
<p>Herein, what is a demeritorious (volitional) process?</p>
<p>(There are) unwholesome intentions in the sense-world sphere, this is said to be a demeritorious (volitional) process.</p>
<p>Herein, what is an imperturbable (volitional) process?</p>
<p>(There are) wholesome intentions in the formless-world sphere, this is said to be an imperturbable (volitional) process.</p>
<p><a class='ref ba' id='ba181' href='#ba181'>BA 181</a>Herein, what is a (volitional) process expressed by way of the body?</p>
