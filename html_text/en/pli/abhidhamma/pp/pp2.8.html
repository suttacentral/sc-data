<p class='question'><a class='pts-vp-en' id='8.1'></a>Who are the four persons identifiable with the path and who are the four identifiable with the fruition?</p>
<p>The stream-attainer and one who proceeds to realise the fruition stage; the once-returner and one who proceeds to realise the fruition stage; the never-returner and one who proceeds to realise the fruition stage; and the Arahant (elect or worthy) and one who proceeds to attain Arahantship—these are the four persons who are identifiable with the path and these the four identifiable with the fruition.</p>
