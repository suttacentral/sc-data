<h1>Monks’ Confession 24: the training rule on worldly gain</h1>
</div>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p><a class="sc" id="1"></a><a class="pts-vp-pli" id="pts-vp-pli4.58"></a><a class="pts-cs" id="Bu-Pc.24.1"></a> <a class="pts-vp-en" id="BD.2.279"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="548"></a> At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the senior monks who instructed the nuns received robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicines. And the monks from the group of six said this about them, “The senior monks aren’t instructing the nuns to render a service, but for the sake of worldly gain.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="2"></a><a class="wt-pa" id="549"></a> The monks of few desires … complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six say that the senior monks aren’t instructing the nuns to render a service, but for the sake of worldly gain?” … “Is it true, monks, that you say this?”</p>
<p>“It’s true, Master.”</p>
<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “… Foolish men, how can you say that the senior monks aren’t instructing the nuns to render a service, but for the sake of worldly gain? This will not give rise to confidence in those without it … And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus:</p>
<h2>Final ruling</h2>
