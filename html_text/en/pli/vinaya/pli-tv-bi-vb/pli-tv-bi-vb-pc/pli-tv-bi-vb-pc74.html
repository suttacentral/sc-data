Now at that time nuns ordained while they were less than twelve years (of standing). They were ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not allowable; moreover, the women who’ shared their cells were ignorant, inexperienced, they did not know what was allowable or what was not allowable. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain while they are less than twelve years (of standing)?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … less than twelve years (of standing)?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … less than twelve years (of standing)? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should ordain while she is less than twelve years (of standing) there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
