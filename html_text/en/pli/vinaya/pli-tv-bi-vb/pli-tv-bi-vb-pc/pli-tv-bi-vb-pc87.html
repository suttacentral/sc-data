Now at that time the group of six nuns wore women’s ornaments. People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns wear women’s ornaments, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns wear women’s ornaments?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that … women’s ornaments?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can … women’s ornaments? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should wear women’s ornaments, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
