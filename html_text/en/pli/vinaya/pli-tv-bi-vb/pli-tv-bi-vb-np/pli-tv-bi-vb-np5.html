Now at that time the nun Thullanandā came to be ill. Then a certain lay-follower approached the nun Thullanandā; having approached, he spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “I hope, lady, that you are better, I hope that you are keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Sir, I am not better, I am not keeping going.”</p>
<p>“Lady, I will deposit a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kahāpaṇa</i> in the house of such and such a shopkeeper; you can have whatever you want brought from there.”</p>
<p>The nun Thullanandā enjoined a certain probationer, saying: “Go, probationer, fetch oil for the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kahāpaṇa</i> from the house of such and such a shopkeeper.”</p>
<p>Then that probationer, <a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.250' href='#Vin.4.250'></a> having for the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kahāpaṇa</i> fetched oil from the house of that shopkeeper, gave it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā said: “I do not need oil, probationer, I need ghee.” Then that probationer approached that shopkeeper; having approached, she spoke thus to that shopkeeper:</p>
<p>“The lady says that she does not need oil, sir, she needs ghee. You take the oil (and) give me the ghee.”</p>
<p>“If we, lady, take back again goods that were bought, when will our goods be sold? Oil was taken owing to the purchase of oil; give for the purchase of ghee (and) you shall take ghee.”</p>
<p>Then that probationer stood crying. Nuns spoke thus to that probationer: “Why are you crying, probationer?” Then that probationer told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, having got one thing in exchange, get another thing in exchange?”</p>
<p><a class='pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.227' href='#BD.3.227'></a> “Is it true, as is said, monks, … <span class='pe'>see <a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-np4/en/horner#Bi-NP.4.1'>Bi-NP.4.1</a>. <i>Instead of</i> having had asked for, etc., <i>read</i> having got in exchange</span> … rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, having got one thing in exchange, should get another thing in exchange, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
