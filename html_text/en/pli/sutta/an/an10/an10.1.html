<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>(1) “Bhante, what is the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>(2) “Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>(3) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of non-regret?”</p>
<p>“The purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>(4) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of joy?”</p>
<p>“The purpose and benefit of joy is rapture.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>(5) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of rapture?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“The purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>(6) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of tranquility?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“The purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>(7) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of pleasure?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11'>SC 11</a>“The purpose and benefit of pleasure <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.2' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“The purpose and benefit of pleasure <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.2'>an.v.2</a>  is concentration.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>(8) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of concentration?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“The purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>(9) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“The purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>(10) “And what, Bhante, is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“The purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Thus, Ānanda, (1)–(2) the purpose and benefit of wholesome virtuous behavior is non-regret; (3) the purpose and benefit of non-regret is joy; (4) the purpose and benefit of joy is rapture; (5) the purpose and benefit of rapture is tranquility; (6) the purpose and benefit of tranquility is pleasure; (7) the purpose and benefit of pleasure is concentration; (8) the purpose and benefit of concentration is the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (9) the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is disenchantment and dispassion; and (10) the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion is the knowledge and vision of liberation. Thus, Ānanda, wholesome virtuous behavior progressively leads to the foremost.”</p>
