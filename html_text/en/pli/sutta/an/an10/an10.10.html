<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>(1) “Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu may be endowed with faith but he is not virtuous … <a class='pts_pn' id='an.v.13'></a> … (2) … endowed with faith and virtuous, but he is not learned … (3) … learned, but not a speaker on the Dhamma … (4) … a speaker on the Dhamma, but not one who frequents assemblies … (5) … one who frequents assemblies, but not one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly … (6) … one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly, but not an expert on the discipline … (7) … an expert on the discipline, but not one who recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births … <span class='pe'>as in 6:2 §4</span> … thus he does not recollect his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details … (8) … one who recollects his manifold past abodes … but not one who, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human … <span class='pe'>as in 6:2 §5</span> … understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma … (9) … one who, with the divine eye … understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma, but not one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Thus he is incomplete with respect to that factor. He should fulfill that factor, <span class='add'>thinking</span>: ‘How can I be endowed with faith … <a class='pts_pn' id='an.v.14'></a> … and also be one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it?’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>(10) “But when a bhikkhu is <span class='roman-numerals'>i</span> endowed with faith, <span class='roman-numerals'>ii</span> virtuous, and <span class='roman-numerals'>iii</span> learned; <span class='roman-numerals'>iv</span> a speaker on the Dhamma; <span class='roman-numerals'>v</span> one who frequents assemblies; <span class='roman-numerals'>vi</span> one who confidently teaches the Dhamma to an assembly; <span class='roman-numerals'>vii</span> an expert on the discipline; <span class='roman-numerals'>viii</span> one who recollects his manifold past abodes … with their aspects and details; <span class='roman-numerals'>ix</span> one who, with the divine eye … understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma; and <span class='roman-numerals'>x</span> one who, with the destruction of the taints, has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, dwells in it, then he is complete with respect to that factor.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities is one who inspires confidence in all respects and who is complete in all aspects.” <a class='pts_pn' id='an.v.15'></a></p>
