<h1>4.16. Exquisiteness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of exquisiteness. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu possesses supreme exquisiteness of form. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of form more excellent or sublime than that one. (2) He possesses supreme exquisiteness of feeling <a class='pts_pn' id='an.ii.18'></a> … (3) … supreme exquisiteness of perception … (4) … supreme exquisiteness of volitional activities. He does not perceive any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one; he does not yearn for any other exquisiteness of volitional activities more excellent or sublime than that one.</p>
<p>“These are the four kinds of exquisiteness.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Having known the exquisiteness of form,<br>
the origination of feelings,<br>
how perception arises,<br>
and where it disappears;<br>
having known volitional activities<br>
as alien, as suffering, and not as self,<br>
truly that bhikkhu who sees rightly,<br>
peaceful, delights in the peaceful state.<br>
He bears his final body,<br>
having conquered Māra and his mount.<br></p>
