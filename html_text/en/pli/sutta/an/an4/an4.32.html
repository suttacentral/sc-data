<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four means of sustaining a favorable relationship. What four? Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. These are the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Giving, endearing speech,<br>
beneficent conduct, and impartiality<br>
under diverse worldly conditions,<br>
as is suitable to fit each case: these means<br>
of sustaining a favorable relationship<br>
are like the linchpin of a rolling chariot.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>If there were no such means<br>
of sustaining a favorable relationship,<br>
neither mother nor father<br>
would be able to obtain esteem<br>
and veneration from their children.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>But since there exist these means<br>
of sustaining a favorable relationship,<br>
wise people respect them;<br>
thus they attain to greatness<br>
and are highly praised. <a class='pts_pn' id='an.ii.33'></a><br></p>
