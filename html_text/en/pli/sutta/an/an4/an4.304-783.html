<h1>4.304–783</h1>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, for direct knowledge … for full understanding … for the utter destruction … for the abandoning … for the destruction … for the vanishing … for the fading away … for the cessation … for the giving up … for the relinquishment of hatred … of delusion … of anger … of hostility … of denigration … of insolence … of envy … of miserliness … of deceitfulness … of craftiness … of obstinacy … of vehemence … of conceit … of arrogance … of intoxication … of heedlessness, these four things are to be developed. What four? (1) Here, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … (2) … feelings in feelings … (3) … mind in mind … (4) … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed longing and dejection in regard to the world. (1) Here, a bhikkhu generates desire for the non-arising of unarisen bad unwholesome states … (2) … for the abandoning of arisen bad unwholesome states … (3) … for the arising of unarisen wholesome states … (4) … for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their non-decline, increase, expansion, and fulfillment by development; he makes an effort, arouses energy, applies his mind, and strives. (1) Here, a bhikkhu develops the basis for psychic potency that possesses concentration due to desire … (2) … that possesses concentration due to energy … (3) … that possesses concentration due to mind … (4) … that possesses concentration due to investigation and activities of striving. For the relinquishment of heedlessness, these four things are to be developed.”</p>
