<h1>4.11. Walking</h1>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>(1) “Bhikkhus, if a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while walking, and he tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, terminate it, and obliterate it, then that bhikkhu is said to be devoid of ardor and moral dread; he is constantly and continuously lazy and lacking in energy while walking.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>(2) “If a sensual thought … arises in a bhikkhu while standing … (3) If a sensual thought … arises in a bhikkhu while sitting … (4) If a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while wakefully lying down, and he tolerates it, does not abandon it, dispel it, terminate it, and obliterate it, then that bhikkhu is said to be devoid of ardor and moral dread; he is constantly and continuously lazy and lacking in energy while wakefully lying down.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>(1) “But, bhikkhus, if a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while walking, and he does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, and obliterates it, then that bhikkhu is said to be ardent and to dread wrongdoing; he is constantly and continuously energetic and resolute while walking.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>(2) “If a sensual thought … arises in a bhikkhu while standing … (3) If a sensual thought … arises in a bhikkhu while sitting … (4) If a sensual thought, a thought of ill will, or a thought of harming arises in a bhikkhu while wakefully lying down, and he does not tolerate it but abandons it, dispels it, terminates it, <a class='pts_pn' id='an.ii.14'></a> and obliterates it, then that bhikkhu is said to be ardent and to dread wrongdoing; he is constantly and continuously energetic and resolute while walking.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>Whether walking or standing,<br>
sitting or lying down,<br>
one who thinks bad thoughts<br>
connected with the household life<br>
has entered upon a dire path,<br>
infatuated by delusive things:<br>
such a bhikkhu cannot reach<br>
the highest enlightenment.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>But one who, whether walking,<br>
standing, sitting, or lying down,<br>
has calmed his thoughts<br>
and delights in the stilling of thought:<br>
a bhikkhu such as this can reach<br>
the highest enlightenment.<br></p>
