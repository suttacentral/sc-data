<h1>4.31. The Wheel</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these four wheels. When these four wheels turn, those devas and humans who possess them soon attain greatness and abundance of wealth. What four? Dwelling in a suitable locality, relying on good persons, right resolution, and merits done in the past. These are the four wheels. When these four wheels turn, those devas and humans who possess them soon attain greatness and abundance of wealth.”</p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>When a person dwells in a suitable locality<br>
and makes friends with the noble ones,<br>
when he has formed right resolutions,<br>
and done deeds of merit in the past,<br>
grain, riches, fame, and reputation,<br>
along with happiness accrue to him.<br></p>
