<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these five powers. What five? The power of faith, the power of energy, the power of mindfulness, the power of concentration, and the power of wisdom. These are the five powers. Among these five powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all in place, the one that unifies them. Just as the peak is the chief part of a peaked-roof house, the part that that holds all in place, that unifies them, so among these five powers, the power of wisdom is foremost, the one that holds all in place, the one that unifies them.”</p>
