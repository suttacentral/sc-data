<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, an irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu falls away and is not established in the good Dhamma. What five? (1) An irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu devoid of faith falls away and is not established in the good Dhamma. (2) An irreverent and undeferential morally shameless bhikkhu … (3) An irreverent and undeferential morally reckless bhikkhu … (4) An irreverent and undeferential lazy bhikkhu … (5) An irreverent and undeferential unwise bhikkhu falls away and is not established in the good Dhamma. Possessing these five qualities, an irreverent and undeferential bhikkhu is not established in the good Dhamma. <a class='pts_pn' id='an.iii.8'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five <span class='add'>other</span> qualities, a reverential and deferential bhikkhu does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma. What five? (1) A reverential and deferential bhikkhu endowed with faith does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma. (2) A reverential and deferential bhikkhu who has a sense of moral shame … (3) A reverential and deferential bhikkhu who has moral dread … (4) A reverential and deferential bhikkhu who is energetic … (5) A reverential and deferential bhikkhu who is wise does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma. Possessing these five qualities, a reverential and deferential bhikkhu does not fall away but is established in the good Dhamma.”</p>
