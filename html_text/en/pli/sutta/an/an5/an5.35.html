<h1>5.35. The Benefits of Giving</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these five benefits of giving. What five? (1) One is dear and agreeable to many people. (2) Good persons resort to one. (3) One acquires a good reputation. (4) One is not deficient in the layperson’s duties. (5) With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. These are the five benefits in giving.”</p>

the good self-controlled monks<br>
always resort to one.<br></p>

that dispels all suffering,<br>
having understood which<br>
