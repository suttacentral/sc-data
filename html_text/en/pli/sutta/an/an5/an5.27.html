<h1>5.27. Concentration</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, being alert and mindful, develop concentration that is measureless. When, alert and mindful, you develop concentration that is measureless, five kinds of knowledge arise that are personally yours. What five? (1) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: ‘This concentration is presently pleasant and in the future has a pleasant result.’ (2) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: ‘This concentration is noble and spiritual.’ (3) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: ‘This concentration is not practiced by low persons.’ (4) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: ‘This concentration is peaceful and sublime, gained by full tranquilization, and attained to unification; it is not reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing <span class='add'>the defilements</span>.’ (5) The knowledge arises that is personally yours: ‘I enter this concentration mindfully and I emerge from it mindfully.’ Bhikkhus, being alert and continuously mindful, develop concentration that is measureless. When you are alert and mindful, developing concentration that is measureless, these five kinds of knowledge arise that are personally yours.” <a class='pts_pn' id='an.iii.25'></a></p>
