<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in hell as if brought there. <a class='pts_pn' id='an.iii.4'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Bhikkhus, possessing five <span class='add'>other</span> qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there. What five? Here, a bhikkhu is endowed with faith, has a sense of moral shame, has moral dread, and is energetic and wise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu is deposited in heaven as if brought there.”</p>
