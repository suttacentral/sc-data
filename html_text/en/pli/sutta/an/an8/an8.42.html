<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, observed complete in eight factors, the uposatha is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive. And how is the uposatha observed complete in eight factors, so that it is of great fruit and benefit, extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>(1) “Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘As long as they live the arahants abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, they dwell compassionate toward all living beings. Today, for this night and day, I too shall abandon and abstain from the destruction of life; with the rod and weapon laid aside, conscientious and kindly, I too shall dwell compassionate toward all living beings. I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.’ This is the first factor it possesses …</p>

I shall imitate the arahants in this respect and the uposatha will be observed by me.’ This is the eighth factor it possesses.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5'>SC 5</a>“To what extent is it of great fruit and benefit? To what extent is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive?

For what reason? Because human kingship is poor compared to celestial happiness.</p>
