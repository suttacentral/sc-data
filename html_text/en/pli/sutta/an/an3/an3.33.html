<h1>3.33. Sāriputta</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Sāriputta, I can teach the Dhamma briefly; I can teach the Dhamma in detail; I can teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. It is those who can understand that are rare.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“It is the time for this, Blessed One. It is the time for this, Fortunate One. The Blessed One should teach the Dhamma briefly; he should teach the Dhamma in detail; he should teach the Dhamma both briefly and in detail. There will be those who can understand the Dhamma.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Therefore, Sāriputta, you should train yourselves thus: (1) ‘There will be no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; (2) there will be no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and (3) we will enter and dwell in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it.’ It is in this way, Sāriputta, that you should train yourselves.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“When, Sāriputta, a bhikkhu <a class='pts_pn' id='an.i.134'></a> has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to this conscious body; when he has no I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit in regard to all external objects; and when he enters and dwells in that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, through which there is no more I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendency to conceit for one who enters and dwells in it, he is called a bhikkhu who has cut off craving, stripped off the fetter, and, by completely breaking through conceit, has made an end of suffering. And it was with reference to this that I said in the Pārāyana, in ‘The Questions of Udaya’:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“The abandoning of both<br>
sensual perceptions and dejection;<br>
the dispelling of dullness,<br>
the warding off of remorse;<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“purified equanimity and mindfulness<br>
preceded by reflection on the Dhamma:<br>
this, I say, is emancipation by final knowledge,<br>
the breaking up of ignorance.”<br></p>
