<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, one who possesses three qualities should be known as a fool. What three? (1) He does not see his transgression as a transgression. (2) When he sees his transgression as a transgression, he does not make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma. (3) When another person confesses a transgression to him, he does not accept it in accordance with the Dhamma. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a fool.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“One who possesses three qualities should be known as a wise person. What three? (1) He sees a transgression as a transgression. (2) When he sees a transgression as a transgression, he makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma. (3) When another person confesses a transgression to him, he accepts it in accordance with the Dhamma. One who possesses these three qualities should be known as a wise person.</p>
