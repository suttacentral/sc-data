What three? He encourages them in discordant bodily action, discordant verbal action, and discordant <span class='add'>mental</span> qualities. Possessing these three qualities, a well-known bhikkhu is acting for the harm of many people, for the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings.</p>
