<h1>3.34. Causes</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What three? Greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>(1) “Any kamma, bhikkhus, fashioned through greed, born of greed, caused by greed, originated by greed, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the <span class='add'>next</span> rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>(2) “Any kamma fashioned through hatred, born of hatred, caused by hatred, originated by hatred, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the <span class='add'>next</span> rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>(3) “Any kamma fashioned through delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originated by delusion, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, <a class='pts_pn' id='an.i.135'></a> it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the <span class='add'>next</span> rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun’s heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited in well-prepared ground in a good field and receive proper rainfall: in this way, those seeds would grow, increase, and mature. So too, any kamma that is fashioned through greed … hatred … delusion, born of delusion, caused by delusion, originated by delusion, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result, either in this very life, or in the <span class='add'>next</span> rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“These are the three causes for the origination of kamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“Bhikkhus, there are these three <span class='add'>other</span> causes for the origination of kamma. What three? Non-greed is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-hatred is a cause for the origination of kamma; non-delusion is a cause for the origination of kamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>(1) “Any kamma, bhikkhus, fashioned through non-greed, born of non-greed, caused by non-greed, originated by non-greed, is abandoned when greed has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a>(2) “Any kamma fashioned through non-hatred, born of non-hatred, caused by non-hatred, originated by non-hatred, is abandoned when hatred has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a>(3) “Any kamma fashioned through non-delusion, born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originated by non-delusion, is abandoned when delusion has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, there are seeds that are intact, unspoiled, <a class='pts_pn' id='an.i.136'></a> not damaged by wind and the sun’s heat, fecund, well preserved. Then a man would burn them in a fire, reduce them to ashes, and winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. In this way, those seeds would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising. So too, any kamma that is fashioned through non-greed … non-hatred … non-delusion, born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originated by non-delusion, is abandoned when delusion has vanished; it is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a>“These, bhikkhus, are the three causes for the origination of kamma.”</p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a>Whatever kamma an ignorant person <span class='add'>has done</span><br>
born of greed, hatred, and delusion,<br>
whether what was fashioned by him be little or much,<br>
it is to be experienced right here:<br>
there exists no other site <span class='add'>for it</span>.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a>Therefore a wise person should abandon<br>
<span class='add'>any deed</span> born of greed, hatred, and delusion.<br>
A bhikkhu, giving rise to knowledge,<br>
should abandon all bad destinations.<br></p>
