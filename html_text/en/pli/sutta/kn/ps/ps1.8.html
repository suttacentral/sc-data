Bhikkhus, <span class='add'>[seeing]</span> what is impermanent as permanent is a perversion of perception, a perversion of cognizance, a perversion of view. <span class='add'>[Seeing]</span> the painful as pleasant is a perversion of perception, a perversion of cognizance, a perversion of view. <span class='add'>[Seeing]</span> what is not self as self is a perversion of perception, a perversion of cognizance, a perversion of view. <span class='add'>[Seeing]</span> the foul as beautiful is a perversion of perception, a perversion of cognizance, a perversion of view.

<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of cognizance, non-perversions of view. What four? Bhikkhus, <span class='add'>[seeing]</span> what is impermanent as impermanent is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of cognizance, a non-perversion of view. <span class='add'>[Seeing]</span> what is painful as painful is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of cognizance, a non-perversion of view. <span class='add'>[Seeing]</span> what is not self as not self is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of cognizance, a non-perversion of view. <span class='add'>[Seeing]</span> what is foul as foul is a non-perversion of perception, a non-perversion of cognizance, a non-perversion of view. These, bhikkhus, are the four non-perversions of perception, non-perversions of cognizance, non-perversions of view.</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<span class='verse-line'>“Beings that can but misperceive</span>
<span class='verse-line'>With cognizance misled and views awry</span>
<span class='verse-line'>Perceive what is impermanent</span>
<span class='verse-line'>As permanent, and what is pain as pleasure,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>As well as the not self as self,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>And beauty too in what is foul; </span>
<span class='verse-line'>Such beings, bound to Māra's yoke,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>Go where is no surcease of bonds;</span>
<span class='verse-line'>They travel round the roundabout</span>
<span class='verse-line'>Where birth and death each hunt the other down.</span>
<span class='verse-line'>Now when Enlightened Ones appear</span>
<span class='verse-line'>And bring the light into the world,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>They promulgate the True Idea,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>Which <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en278' href='#pts-vp-en278'>PTS vp En 278</a> leads on to release from suffering.</span>
<span class='verse-line'>The wise, on hearing what they tell,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>Apply their minds to seek the truth:</span>
<span class='verse-line'>They see the impermanent as it is,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>And pain they see as only pain,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>They see what is not self as such,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>And likewise too they see the foul;</span>
<span class='verse-line'>Such views as they adopt are right,</span>
<span class='verse-line'>And they it is escape from suffering”.</span>

<p>2. In a person who possesses <span class='add'>[right]</span> view <span class='add'>[by his being a stream enterer]</span> are these four perversions abandoned or unabandoned?</p>
<p>Some are abandoned, and some are unabandoned. The perversion of perception, perversion of cognizance, and perversion of view, <span class='add'>[that see]</span> what is impermanent as permanent are abandoned in him. The perception <span class='add'>[that sees]</span> what is painful as pleasant arises, and so does the cognizance, but such perversion of view is abandoned in him. The perversion of perception, perversion of cognizance, and perversion of view, <span class='add'>[that see]</span> what is not self as self are abandoned in him. The perception <span class='add'>[that sees]</span> the foul as beautiful arises, and so does the cognizance, but such perversion of view is abandoned in him.</p>
<p>3. In two instances <span class='add'>[—the first and third—]</span> six perversions are abandoned. In two instances <span class='add'>[—the second and fourth—]</span> two perversions are abandoned and four perversions are unabandoned. In <span class='add'>[all]</span> four instances eight perversions are abandoned and four perversions are unabandoned.</p>
