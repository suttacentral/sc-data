<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en329' href='#pts-vp-en329'>PTS vp En 329</a>1. “Thus I heard. At one time the Blessed One was living at Benares in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There he addressed the bhikkhus of the Group of Five thus:</p>
<p>‘Bhikkhus, there are these two extremes that ought not to be cultivated by one who has gone forth. What two? There is devotion to pursuit of sensual desires, which is low, coarse, vulgar, ignoble and harmful; and there is devotion to self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble and harmful. The middle way discovered by the Perfect One avoids both these extremes; it creates an eye, creates knowledge, and leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to full enlightenment, to nibbana. And what is that middle way? It is this noble Eightfold Path, that is to say: right view, right thought, right speaking, right acting, right living, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. That is the middle way discovered by the Perfect One, which creates an eye, creates knowledge, and leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to full enlightenment, to nibbana.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of suffering: birth is suffering, ageing is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, association with what is disliked is suffering, dissociation from what is liked is suffering, not to get what one wants is suffering—in short, the five aggregates <span class='add'>[as objects]</span> of clinging are suffering.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of the origin of suffering: it is craving, which produces renewed being, is accompanied by delight and greed, delighting in this and that; in other words, craving for sensual desires, craving for being, craving for non-being.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the denying, relinquishing, leaving, rejecting of it.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: it is this noble eightfold path, that is to say: right view, right thought, right speaking, right acting, right living, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of suffering: such was the eye that arose, the knowledge that arose, the understanding that arose, the recognition that arose, the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before. This noble actuality of suffering must be fully understood: such was the eye that arose, the knowledge that arose, the understanding that arose, the recognition that arose, the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en330' href='#pts-vp-en330'>PTS vp En 330</a> before. This noble actuality of suffering has been fully understood: such was the eye that arose, the knowledge that arose, the understanding that arose, the recognition that arose, the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of the origin of suffering: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before. This noble actuality of the origin of suffering must be abandoned: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before. This noble actuality of the origin of suffering has been abandoned: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of the cessation of suffering: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before. This noble actuality of the cessation of suffering must be realized: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before. This noble actuality of the cessation of suffering has been realized: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose in me about ideas not heard before.</p>
<p>‘There is this noble actuality of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before. This noble actuality of the way leading to the cessation of suffering must be developed: such was the eye that arose, … the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before. This noble actuality of the way leading to the cessation of suffering has been developed: such was the eye that arose, the knowledge that arose, the understanding that arose, the recognition that arose, the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before.</p>
<p>‘As long as my correct knowledge and seeing in these twelve aspects—in these three phases in regard to these four noble actualities—was not quite purified, so long did I not claim to have discovered the full enlightenment that is supreme in the world with its deities, its Māras and its Brahmā Gods, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, its princes and men. But as soon as my correct knowledge and seeing in these twelve aspects—in these three phases in regard to each of these four noble actualities—was quite purified, then I claimed to have discovered the full enlightenment that is supreme in the world with its deities, its Māras and its Brahmā Gods, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, its princes and men.</p>
<p>‘The knowledge and seeing arose in me: My will's deliverance is unassailable; this is the last birth; there is now no renewal of being’.</p>
<p>‘So the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus of the Group of Five were glad, and they rejoiced at the Blessed One's words.</p>
<p>‘Now<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en331' href='#pts-vp-en331'>PTS vp En 331</a> while this discourse was being delivered, the spotless, stainless Eye of the True Idea arose in the venerable Koṇḍañña thus: “All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation”.</p>
<p>‘And when the Wheel of the True Idea had been set rolling by the Blessed One, the earth deities cried out: “At Benares, in the Deer Park at Isipatana, a Perfect One, Accomplished and fully Enlightened, has set the matchless Wheel of the True Idea rolling, that cannot be stopped by ascetic or brahman or deity or Māra or Brahmā God or anyone in the world”. And hearing the earth deities' cry, the deities of the Cātumahārājika Heaven cried out: “At Benares, …” And hearing the Cātumahārājika deities' cry, the deities of Tāvatiṃsa … the deities of Tusita … the deities of Yāma … the deities of Nimmānarati … the deities of Paranimmitavasavatti … the deities of Brahmā's Retinue cried out: “At Benares, …” So the news went at that moment, at that minute, at that instant right up to the Brahmā World. And this ten-thousand-fold world principle shook and quaked and trembled while a great measureless light surpassing the splendour of the gods appeared in the world. Then the Blessed One exclaimed: “Koṇḍañña knows, Koṇḍañña knows”!, and so that venerable one acquired the name Aññatar Koṇḍañña—Koṇḍañña who knows’,”.</p>
<p>2. “<i>There is this noble actuality of suffering: such was the eye that arose, the knowledge that arose, the understanding that arose, the recognition that arose, the light that arose, in me about ideas not heard before</i>”.</p>
<p>3. <i>The eye that arose</i>: in what sense? The <i>knowledge that arose</i>: in what sense? The <i>understanding that arose</i>: in what sense? The <i>recognition that arose</i>: in what sense? The <i>light that arose</i>: in what sense?</p>
<p>The eye that arose in the meaning of seeing. The knowledge that arose in the meaning of what-is-known. The understanding that arose in the meaning of act-of-understanding. The recognition that arose in the meaning of penetration. The light that arose in the meaning of illumination.</p>
<p>4. The eye is an idea, the knowledge is an idea, the understanding is an idea, the recognition is an idea, the light is an idea. These five ideas are the supporting object and the domain of the discrimination-of-ideas. Those that are its supporting object are its domain; those that are its domain are its supporting object. Hence it is said: Knowledge of ideas is the discrimination-of-ideas.</p>
<p>Meaning as seeing is a meaning, meaning as what-is-known is a meaning, meaning as act-of-understanding is a meaning, meaning as penetration is a meaning, meaning as illumination is a meaning. These five meanings are the supporting object and the domain of the discrimination-of-meaning. Those that are its supporting object are its domain; those that are its <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en332' href='#pts-vp-en332'>PTS vp En 332</a> domain are its supporting object. Hence it is said: Knowledge of meanings is the discrimination-of-meaning.</p>
<p>There are enunciation of word-language in order to indicate the five sorts of ideas and enunciation of word-language in order to indicate the five sorts of meanings. These ten sorts of language are the supporting object and the domain of the discrimination-of-language. Those that are its supporting object are its domain; those that are its domain are its supporting object. Hence it is said: Knowledge of kinds of language is discrimination-of-language.</p>
<p>There are <span class='add'>[instances of]</span> knowledge of the five sorts of ideas and <span class='add'>[instances of]</span> knowledge of the five sorts of meaning and <span class='add'>[instances of]</span> knowledge of the ten sorts of language. These twenty <span class='add'>[instances of]</span> knowledge are the supporting object and the domain of the discrimination-of-perspicuity. Those that are its supporting object are its domain; those that are its domain are its supporting object. Hence it is said: Knowledge of kinds of perspicuity is discrimination-of-perspicuity.</p>
