<p>2. (i) In the case of a successful destination, in what eight root-causes does rearising have its conditions at <span class='add'>[the moment of rebirth-linking]</span> associated with knowledge?</p>
<p>At the moment of impulsion of profitable action <span class='add'>[in the previous life]</span>, three root-causes, being profitable, are conascence conditions for the volition produced at that moment; hence “With profitable root-causes as condition there are formations” is said. At the moment of attachment <span class='add'>[immediately prior to death]</span>, “two root-causes”, <span class='add'>[namely, greed and delusion,]</span> being unprofitable, are conascence conditions for the volition produced at that time; hence “With unprofitable root-causes as conditions there are formations” is said. At the moment of rebirth-linking <span class='add'>[in the new life]</span>, three root-causes, being indeterminate, are conascence conditions <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en272' href='#pts-vp-en272'>PTS vp En 272</a> for the volition produced at that moment; hence “With mentality-materiality as condition there is consciousness and with consciousness as condition there is mentality-materiality” is said.</p>
<p>3. At the time of the rebirth-linking, the five aggregates are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and dissociation conditions. At the moment of rebirth-linking, the four great entities are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and dissociation conditions. At the moment of rebirth-linking, the three life-formations <span class='add'>[of life-span, heat and consciousness]</span> are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and dissociation conditions. At the moment of rebirth-linking, mentality and materiality are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and dissociation conditions.</p>
<p>At the moment of rebirth-linking, these fourteen ideas are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and dissociation conditions.</p>
<p>4. At the moment of rebirth-linking, the four immaterial aggregates are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and association conditions. At the moment of rebirth-linking, the five faculties <span class='add'>[of faith, etc.,]</span> are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and association conditions. At the moment of rebirth-linking, three root-causes are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and association conditions. At the moment of rebirth-linking, mentality and consciousness are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and association conditions.</p>
<p>At the moment of rebirth-linking, these fourteen ideas are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and association conditions.</p>
<p>5. At the moment of rebirth-linking, these twenty-eight ideas are conascence conditions, mutuality conditions, support conditions, and dissociation conditions.</p>
<p>6. In the case of a successful destination, rebirth has its conditions in these eight root-causes at <span class='add'>[the moment of rebirth-linking]</span> associated with knowledge.</p>

<p>22. (i) In the case of a successful destination, in what six root-causes does rebirth have its conditions at <span class='add'>[the moment of rebirth-linking]</span> dissociated from knowledge?</p>
<p>At the moment of impulsion of profitable action <span class='add'>[in the previous life]</span>, two root-causes, being profitable, are conascence conditions for the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en274' href='#pts-vp-en274'>PTS vp En 274</a> volition produced at that moment; hence “With profitable root-causes as conditions there are formations” is said. At the moment of attachment <span class='add'>[immediately prior to death]</span>, two root-causes, <span class='add'>[namely greed and delusion,]</span> being unprofitable, are conascence conditions for the volition produced at that moment; hence “With unprofitable root-causes as conditions there are formations” is said. At the moment of rebirth-linking <span class='add'>[in the new life]</span>, two root-causes, being indeterminate, are conascence conditions for the volition produced at that moment; hence “With mentality-materiality as condition there is consciousness and with consciousness as condition there is mentality-materiality” is said</p>
<p>23. At the moment of rebirth-linking, the five aggregates … <span class='add'>[repeat § 3]</span>.</p>
