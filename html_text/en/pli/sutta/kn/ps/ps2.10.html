<h1>2.10. Treatise on Voidness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en356' href='#pts-vp-en356'>PTS vp En 356</a>1. Thus I heard. At one time the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then the venerable Ānanda went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side. When he had done so, he asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, ‘The world is void, the world is void' is said. In what way is the world void”?</p>
<p>“Because it is void of self or of what belongs to self, therefore ‘the world is void' is said, Ānanda. And what is it that is void of self or of what belongs to self? Eye is void of self or of what belongs to self, visible objects are void of self or of what belongs to self, eye consciousness is void of self or of what belongs to self, eye contact is void of self or of what belongs to self; and any feeling that arises born of eye contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, is also void of self or of what belongs to self. Ear is void of self or of what belongs to self, sounds … Nose is void of self or of what belongs to self, odours … Tongue is void of self or of what belongs to self, flavours … Body is void of self or of what belongs to self, tangible objects … Mind is void of self or of what belongs to self, ideas … mind consciousness … mind contact … any feeling that arises born of mind contact, whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, is also void of self or of what belongs to self. Because it is void of self or of what belongs to self, therefore ‘the world is void' is said”.</p>
<p>2. There is voidness as voidness, voidness of formations, voidness in change, supreme voidness, voidness by characteristic.</p>
<p>There is voidness by suppression, voidness by substitution of opposites, voidness by cutting off, voidness by tranquillization, voidness as escape.</p>
<p>There is internal voidness, external voidness, voidness in both ways.</p>
<p>There is similar voidness, dissimilar voidness.</p>
<p>There is voidness in search, voidness in embracing, voidness in obtainment, voidness in penetration.</p>
<p>There is voidness in unity, voidness in difference.</p>
<p>There is voidness in choice, voidness in steadiness, voidness in fathoming, and voidness in the ultimate meaning of all kinds of voidness, which is the terminating of occurrence in <span class='add'>[the Arahant]</span>, who is fully aware.</p>
<p>3. What is <i>voidness as voidness</i>?</p>
<p>Eye is void of self or of what belongs to self or of what is permanent or <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en357' href='#pts-vp-en357'>PTS vp En 357</a> everlasting or eternal or not-subject-to-change. Ear … Nose … Tongue … Body … Mind is void of self or of what belongs to self or of what is permanent or everlasting or eternal or not-subject-to-change.</p>
<p>This is voidness as voidness.</p>
<p>4. What is <i>voidness of formations</i>?</p>
<p>There are three kinds of formation: the formation of merit, the formation of demerit, and the formation of imperturbability.</p>
<p>The formation of merit is void of the formation of demerit and of the formation of imperturbability. The formation of demerit is void of the formation of merit and of the formation of imperturbability. The formation of imperturbability is void of the formation of merit and of the formation of demerit.</p>
<p>There are these three kinds of formation.</p>
<p>There are three more kinds of formation: the body formation, the speech formation, and the cognizance formation.</p>
<p>The body formation is void of the speech formation and the cognizance formation. The speech formation is void of the body formation and the cognizance formation. The cognizance formation is void of the body formation and the speech formation.</p>
<p>There are these three kinds of formation.</p>
<p>There are three more kinds of formation: past formations, future formations, and presently arisen formations.</p>
<p>Past formations are void of future and presently-arisen formations. Future formations are void of past formations and presently-arisen formations. Presently-arisen formations are void of past formations and future formations.</p>
<p>There are these three kinds of formation.</p>

<p>5. What is <i>voidness in change</i>? Born materiality is void of individual essence; disappeared materiality is both changed and void.

The characteristic of the fool is void of the characteristic of the wise man, and the characteristic of the wise man is void of the characteristic of the fool.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of characteristic: the characteristic of arising, the characteristic of fall, and the characteristic of the alteration of what is present. The characteristic of arising is void of the characteristic of fall and the characteristic of the alteration of what is present. The characteristic of fall is void of the characteristic of arising and the characteristic of the alteration of what is present. The characteristic of the alteration of what is present is void of the characteristic of arising and the characteristic of fall. Materiality's characteristic of arising is void of its characteristic of fall and its characteristic of the alteration of what is present; materiality's characteristic of fall is void of its characteristic of arising and its characteristic of the alteration of what is present; materiality's characteristic of the alteration of what is present is void of its characteristic of arising and its characteristic of fall.
