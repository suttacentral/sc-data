<p>“And how is it, bhikkhus, that by depending on virtue, standing on virtue, a bhikkhu develops the noble eightfold path, makes much of the noble eightfold path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view depending on seclusion, depending on fading away, depending on cessation, resulting in relinquishment; he develops right thought … right speaking … right action … right living … right effort … right mindfulness … he develops right concentration depending on seclusion, depending on fading away, depending on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. That is how, by depending on virtue, standing on virtue, a bhikkhu develops the noble eightfold path, makes much of the noble eightfold path.</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, just as these seeds and plants that come to growth, increase and maturity all do so by depending on the earth, standing on the earth, and that is how they come to growth, increase and maturity, so too, it is by depending on virtue, by standing on virtue, that a bhikkhu developing the noble eightfold path, making much of the noble eightfold path, reaches growth, increase and maturity in <span class='add'>[good]</span> ideas.</p>

Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view depending on seclusion, … <span class='add'>[as above]</span> … develops right concentration depending on seclusion, depending on fading away, depending on cessation, resulting in relinquishment”.</p>
