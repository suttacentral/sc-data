<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en317' href='#pts-vp-en317'>PTS vp En 317</a>1. “Bhikkhus, when the deliverance of will by loving kindness is cultivated, developed and made much of, made the vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated, and properly undertaken, then eleven blessings can be expected. What eleven? A man sleeps in comfort, wakes in comfort, and dreams no evil dreams; he is dear to human beings, he is dear to non-human beings, deities guard him, fire and poison do not harm him; his mind is easily concentrated, the expression on his face is serene; he dies undeluded, and if he does not penetrate the supreme state he will be reborn in the Brahmā world. When the deliverance of will by loving kindness is cultivated, developed and made much of, made the vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated and properly undertaken, then these eleven blessings can be expected”.</p>
