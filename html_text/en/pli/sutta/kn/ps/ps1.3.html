<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en164' href='#pts-vp-en164'>PTS vp En 164</a>1. When anyone develops concentration by mindfulness of breathing with sixteen grounds, over two hundred kinds of knowledge arise in him:</p>
<ol type='i'>
<li>eight kinds of knowledge of obstacles and eight kinds of knowledge of aids,</li>
<li>eighteen kinds of knowledge of imperfections,</li>
<li>thirteen kinds of knowledge of cleansing,</li>
<li>thirty-two kinds of knowledge in mindful workers,</li>
<li>twenty-four kinds of knowledge through concentration,</li>
<li>seventy-two kinds of knowledge through insight,</li>
<li>eight kinds of knowledge of dispassion,</li>
<li>eight kinds of knowledge of what is in conformity with dispassion,</li>
<li>eight kinds of knowledge as tranquillization of dispassion,</li>
<li>twenty-one kinds of knowledge of pleasure of deliverance.</li>
</ol> 
<h2>Section I</h2>
<p><i>2. What are the eight kinds of knowledge of obstacles and eight kinds knowledge of aids?</i></p>
<p>3. Zeal for sensual-desires is an obstacle to concentration, renunciation is an aid to concentration.</p>
<p>Ill-will is an obstacle …, non-ill-will is an aid …</p>
<p>Stiffness-and-torpor is an obstacle …, perception of light is an aid …</p>
<p>Agitation is an obstacle …, non-distraction is an aid …</p>
<p>Uncertainty is an obstacle …, definition-of-ideas is an aid …</p>
<p>Ignorance is an obstacle …, knowledge is an aid …</p>
<p>Boredom is an obstacle …, gladness is an aid …</p>
<p>Also all unprofitable ideas are an obstacle to concentration, and all profitable ideas are an aid to concentration.</p>
<p>These are the eight kinds of knowledge of obstacles and eight kinds of knowledge of aids.</p>
<p>4. When cognizance is oriented, well oriented, in these sixteen aspects, it establishes the unities and is purified from hindrances.</p>
<p>What are these unities?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en165' href='#pts-vp-en165'>PTS vp En 165</a>Renunciation is unity, non-ill-will is unity, perception of light is unity, non-distraction is unity, definition-of-ideas is unity, knowledge is unity, gladness is unity, also all profitable ideas are unity.</p>
<p>5. What are these hindrances?</p>
<p>Zeal for sensual-desires is a hindrance, ill-will is a hindrance, stiffness-and-torpor is a hindrance, agitation is a hindrance, uncertainty is a hindrance, ignorance is a hindrance, boredom is a hindrance, also all unprofitable ideas are a hindrance.</p>
<p><i>Hindrance</i>: in what sense hindrance?</p>
<p>They are hindrances in the sense of blocking the outlets.</p>
<p>What are the outlets?</p>
<p>Renunciation is an outlet for noble ones, and noble ones are let out by renunciation: zeal for sensual-desires blocks that outlet, and because one is hindered by zeal for sensual-desires one does not understand the noble ones' outlet consisting in renunciation.</p>
<p>Non-ill-will … ill-will …</p>
<p>Perception-of-light … stiffness-and-torpor …</p>
<p>Non-distraction … agitation …</p>
<p>Definition-of-ideas … uncertainty …</p>
<p>Knowledge … ignorance …</p>
<p>Gladness … boredom …</p>
<p>Also all profitable ideas are an outlet for noble ones, and noble ones are let out by all profitable ideas: all unprofitable ideas block that outlet, and because one is hindered by all unprofitable ideas one does not understand the noble ones' outlet consisting in all profitable ideas.</p>
<h2>Section II</h2>
<p>6. When one whose cognizance is purified from these hindrances develops concentration by mindfulness of breathing with sixteen grounds, the following eighteen imperfections arise in him in momentary combinations.</p>
<p>What eighteen imperfections arise?</p>
<p>(1) When he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning, middle and end of an in-breath, his cognizance becomes distracted internally, and that is an obstruction to concentration.</p>
<p>(2) When he goes out with mindfulness after the beginning, middle and end of an out-breath, his cognizance becomes distracted externally, and that is an obstruction to concentration.</p>
<p>(3) Such behaviour of craving as hope for, and attachment to, in-breath is an obstruction to concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en166' href='#pts-vp-en166'>PTS vp En 166</a>(4) Such behaviour of craving as hope for, and attachment to, out-breath is an obstruction to concentration.</p>
<p>(5) Any longing for out-breath in him, when he is fatigued by <span class='add'>[too long or too short]</span> in-breath, is an obstruction to concentration.</p>
<p>(6) Any longing for in-breath in him, when he is fatigued by out-breath, is an obstruction to concentration.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>14. When one whose cognizance is purified from those hindrances <span class='add'>[mentioned in Section I.]</span> develops concentration by mindfulness of breathing with sixteen grounds these eighteen imperfections arise in him in momentary combinations.</p>
<h2>Section III</h2>
<p>15. What are the thirteen kinds of knowledge of cleansing?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en169' href='#pts-vp-en169'>PTS vp En 169</a>(1) Cognizance that runs after the past <span class='add'>[breaths]</span> is attacked by distraction: by avoiding that he concentrates it in one place, thus cognizance does not become distracted.</p>
<p>(2) Cognizance that looks forward to the future <span class='add'>[breaths]</span> is shakable: by avoiding that he composes it there, thus also cognizance does not become distracted.</p>
<p>(3) Slack cognizance is attacked by indolence: by exerting it he abandons indolence, thus also cognizance does not become distracted.</p>
<p>(4) Over-exerted cognizance is attacked by agitation: by curbing it he abandons agitation, thus also cognizance does not become distracted.</p>
<p>(5) Enticed cognizance is attacked by greed: by being fully aware of that he abandons greed, thus also cognizance does not become distracted.</p>
<p>(6) Repelled cognizance is attacked by ill-will: by being fully aware of that he abandons ill-will, thus also cognizance does not become distracted.</p>
<p>In these six aspects cognizance becomes purified and bright and arrives at the unities.</p>
<p>16. What are these unities? They are:</p>
<p>(7) the unity consisting in establishing the will-to-relinquish a gift <span class='add'>[in the act of giving]</span>,</p>
<p>(8) the unity consisting in establishing the sign of serenity <span class='add'>[in concentration]</span>,</p>
<p>(9) the unity consisting in establishing the characteristic of fall <span class='add'>[in insight]</span>,</p>
<p>(10) the unity consisting in establishing cessation <span class='add'>[in the path]</span>.</p>
<p>17. The unity consisting in establishing the will-to-relinquish a gift belongs to those resolute on giving up. The unity consisting in establishing the sign of serenity belongs to those devoted to the Higher Cognizance. The unity consisting in establishing the characteristic of fall belongs to those practising insight. The unity consisting in establishing cessation belongs to Noble Persons.</p>
<p>18. In these four instances cognizance arrived at unity</p>
<p>(11) enters into purification of the way,</p>
<p>(12) is intensified in equanimity,</p>
<p>(13) is satisfied by knowledge.</p>
<p>19. What is the beginning, the middle, and the end, of the first jhana?</p>
<p>Of the first jhana purification of the way is the beginning, intensification of equanimity is the middle, and encouragement is the end.</p>
<p>20. <i>Of the first jhana purification of the way is the beginning</i>: how many characteristics has the beginning?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en170' href='#pts-vp-en170'>PTS vp En 170</a>The beginning has three characteristics:</p>
<p>(i) cognizance is purified of obstructions to that <span class='add'>[jhana]</span>;</p>
<p>(ii) because it is purified, cognizance makes way for the central <span class='add'>[state of equilibrium, which is the]</span> sign of serenity;</p>
<p>(iii) because it has made way, cognizance enters into that state.</p>
<p>And in that cognizance is purified of obstructions, and because it is purified, cognizance makes way for the central <span class='add'>[state of equilibrium, which is the]</span> sign of serenity, and because it has made way, cognizance enters into that state, purification of the way is the beginning of the first jhana. These are the three characteristics of the beginning. Hence it is said that the first jhana is good in the beginning, which possesses <span class='add'>[three]</span> characteristics.</p>
<p>21. <i>Of the first jhana intensification of equanimity is the middle</i>: how many characteristics has the middle?</p>
<p>The middle has three characteristics:</p>
<p>(iv) he looks on with equanimity at cognizance that is purified;</p>
<p>(v) he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity;</p>
<p>(vi) he looks on with equanimity at the establishment of unity.</p>
<p>And in that he <span class='add'>[now]</span> looks on with equanimity at cognizance that is purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made way for serenity and looks on with equanimity at the establishment of unity, that intensification of equanimity is the middle of the first jhana. These are the three characteristics of the middle. Hence it is said that the first jhana is good in the middle, which possesses <span class='add'>[three]</span> characteristics.</p>
<p>22. <i>Of the first jhana encouragement is the end</i>: how many characteristics has the end?</p>
<p>The end has four characteristics:</p>
<p>(vii) encouragement in the sense that there was non-excess of the ideas arisen therein;</p>
<p>(viii) encouragement in the sense that the faculties had a single function (taste);</p>
<p>(ix) encouragement in the sense that the appropriate energy was effective;</p>
<p>(x) encouragement in the sense of repetition;</p>
<p>are the encouragement in the end of the first jhana. These are the four characteristics of the end. Hence it is said that the first jhana is good in the end, which possesses <span class='add'>[four]</span> characteristics.</p>
<p>23. Cognizance that has reached the triple cycle <span class='add'>[of beginning, middle and end]</span> thus and is good in the three ways and possesses the ten characteristics, also possesses <span class='add'>[the five jhana factors of]</span> applied-thought and sustained-thought and happiness and pleasure and steadiness as well as <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en171' href='#pts-vp-en171'>PTS vp En 171</a> <span class='add'>[the five faculties and powers of]</span> faith and energy and mindfulness and concentration and understanding.</p>
<p>24. What is the beginning, the middle, and the end, of the second jhana? Of the second jhana purification of the way is the beginning, intensification of equanimity is the middle, and encouragement is the end.</p>
<p>25.–28. <i>Of the second jhana purification of the way is the beginning</i>: how many characteristics has the beginning?</p>
<p>The beginning has three … <span class='add'>[repeat §§ 20 to 23, substituting <i>second jhana</i> for <i>first jhana</i>]</span></p>
<p>29.–33. What is the beginning, the middle, and the end, of the third jhana? … <span class='add'>[repeat §§ 19 to 23]</span></p>
<p>34.–38. What is the beginning, the middle, and the end, of the fourth jhana? …</p>
<p>39.–58. … <span class='add'>[repeat the same five §§ for each of the four immaterial attainments]</span> …</p>
<p>59.–148. … <span class='add'>[repeat the same five §§ for each of the 18 Principal Insights]</span> …</p>
<p>149.–168. … <span class='add'>[repeat the same five §§ for each of the four paths]</span> …</p>

</blockquote>
<p>170. How is it that these three ideas are not the supporting object of a single cognizance, that they are nevertheless not unrecognized, that cognizance does not become distracted, that he manifests endeavour, carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effect?</p>
<p>Suppose there were a tree trunk placed on a level piece of ground, and a man cut it with a saw. The man's mindfulness is established by the saw's teeth where they touch the tree trunk, without his giving attention to the saw's teeth as they approach and recede, though they are not unrecognized <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en172' href='#pts-vp-en172'>PTS vp En 172</a> by him as they do so; and he manifests endeavour, carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effect.</p>
<p>As the tree trunk placed on the level piece of ground, so the sign for the anchoring of mindfulness. As the saw's teeth, so the in-breaths and out-breaths. As the man's mindfulness, established by the saw's teeth where they touch the tree trunk, without his giving attention to the saw's teeth as they approach and recede, though they are not unrecognized by him as they do so, and so he manifests endeavour, carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effect, so too the bhikkhu sits, having established mindfulness at the nose tip or on the upper lip, without giving attention to the in-breaths and out-breaths as they approach and recede, though they are not unrecognized by him as they do so, and he manifests endeavour, carries out a task and achieves a distinctive effect.</p>
<p>What is the endeavour? The body and the cognizance of one who is energetic become wieldy: this is the endeavour.</p>
<p>What is the task? Imperfections come to be abandoned in one who is energetic, and his applied-thoughts are stilled: this is the task.</p>
<p>What is the effect? Fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic, and his underlying tendencies come to be done away with: this is the distinctive effect.</p>
<p>So these three things are not the supporting object of a single cognizance and they are nevertheless not unrecognized, and cognizance does not become distracted, and he manifests endeavour, carries out a task, and achieves a distinctive effect.</p>

<p>172. <i>Breathing in</i> (<i>āna</i>) is in-breath (<i>assāsa</i>); <i>breathing out</i> (<i>apāna</i>) is out-breath (<i>passāsa</i>). Establishment (foundation) by means of in-breath is <i>mindfulness</i>; establishment (foundation) by means of out-breath is <i>mindfulness</i>. When he breathes in it is established (founded) in him; when he breathes out it is established (founded) in him.</p>
<p>173. <i>Perfect</i>: perfect in the sense of embracing <span class='add'>[jhana, insight and path]</span>; perfect in the sense of <span class='add'>[the mutual]</span> equipment <span class='add'>[of all ideas connected therewith]</span>; perfect in the sense of perfection.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en173' href='#pts-vp-en173'>PTS vp En 173</a>174. <i>Well developed</i>: There are four kinds of development:</p>
<p>(i) development in the sense of non-excess of ideas arisen therein (I § 135),</p>
<p>(ii) development in the sense of single function (taste) of the faculties (I § 134),</p>
<p>(iii) development in the sense of effectiveness of appropriate energy,</p>
<p>(iv) development in the sense of repetition.</p>
<p>These four kinds of development in him are made the vehicle, made the ground, consolidated, reinforced and brought to very sameness.</p>
<p>“Made the vehicle”: he has mastery, power and assurance wherever he wishes, those ideas <span class='add'>[of serenity and insight]</span> are ready to his adverting, ready to his wish, ready to his attention, ready to his arising of cognizance. Hence “made the vehicle” was said.</p>
<p>“Made the ground”: his mindfulness is well-established (founded) on whatever basis his cognizance is well steadied on. His cognizance is well steadied on whatever ground his mindfulness is well established (founded) on. Hence “made the ground” was said.</p>
<p>“Consolidated”: his mindfulness has parallel turn-over with whatever he guides his cognizance by. He guides his cognizance by whatever his mindfulness has parallel turn-over with. Hence “consolidated” was said.</p>
<p>“Reinforced”: reinforced in the sense of embracing, reinforced in the sense of equipment, reinforced in the sense of perfection. When he embraces with mindfulness, he conquers evil, unprofitable ideas. Hence “reinforced” was said.</p>
<p>“Brought to very sameness” (<i>susamāraddhā</i>); there are four kinds of bringing to very sameness: bringing to very sameness in the sense of non-excess of ideas arisen therein, bringing to very sameness in the sense of single function (taste) of the faculties, bringing to very sameness in the sense of effectiveness of appropriate energy, bringing to very sameness owing to verisimilar abolition (<i>susamugghātattā</i>) of defilements opposed thereto.</p>
<p>“Very sameness” (<i>susamaṃ</i>): there is sameness (<i>samaṃ</i>) and very sameness (<i>susamaṃ</i>). What is sameness? Ideas there arisen that are blameless and partake of enlightenment: this is sameness. What is very sameness? The supporting object for such ideas, namely, cessation, nibbana: this is very sameness. This sameness and this very sameness are known, seen, recognized, realized, sounded with understanding; tireless energy is brought to bear (<i>āraddha</i>), established (founded) mindfulness is unremitting, the tranquillized body brings no trouble (<i>asāraddho</i>), concentrated cognizance is unified. Hence “brought to very sameness” (<i>susamāraddhā</i>) was said.</p>
<p>175. <i>Gradually brought to growth</i>: previously prepared for growth and <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en174' href='#pts-vp-en174'>PTS vp En 174</a> subsequently brought to growth by long in-breath, previously prepared for growth and subsequently brought to growth by long out-breath, … <span class='add'>[and so on with the rest of the 32 modes, see § 183 below, up to]</span> … previously prepared for growth and subsequently brought to growth by out-breath contemplating relinquishment. Also all the varieties of mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen grounds are prepared for growth and brought to growth interdependently. Hence “gradually brought to growth” was said.</p>
<p>176. <i>According as</i>: there are ten meanings of “according as”, namely, meaning of “according as” as meaning of self-control, meaning of “according as” as meaning of serenity in oneself, … as meaning of extinguishment in oneself, … as meaning of direct knowledge, … as meaning of full understanding, … as meaning of abandoning, … as meaning of developing, … as meaning of realizing, … as meaning of convergence upon actuality, meaning of “according as” as meaning of establishment in cessation.</p>
<p>177. <i>Buddha</i> (Enlightened One): he who is the Blessed One, who is what he is of himself, without teacher in ideas not heard before, who discovered (<i>abhisambujjhati</i>) the actualities by himself, reached omniscient knowledge therein and the powers and mastery.</p>
<p><i>Buddha</i>: in what sense <i>buddha</i>? He is the discoverer (<i>bujjhitar</i>) of the actualities, thus he is enlightened (<i>buddha</i>). He is the awakener (<i>bodhetar</i>) of the generation, thus he is enlightened. He is enlightened by omniscience, enlightened by seeing all, enlightened without dependence on others' instruction, enlightened because of majesty, he is enlightened through the quality of having exhausted cankers, enlightened through the quality of being free from the essentials of being. He is quite without greed, thus he is enlightened; he is quite without hate, thus he is enlightened; he is quite without delusion, thus he is enlightened; he is quite without defilement, thus he is enlightened; he has travelled the path that goes on only one way, thus he is enlightened; he alone discovered the peerless full enlightenment, thus he is enlightened. He is enlightened because he has destroyed unenlightenment and obtained enlightenment.</p>
<p><i>Buddha</i>: this is not a name made by a mother, made by a father, made by a brother, made by a sister, made by friends and companions, made by relatives and kin, made by ascetics and brahmans, made by deities: this is a name (derived) from the final liberation of the Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of the Enlightenment Tree, this name “Enlightened One (Buddha)” is a description (concept) based on realization.</p>

<p>182. <i>Just like the full moon free from cloud</i>: Defilements are like clouds, the noble ones' knowledge is like the moon. The bhikkhu is like the deity's son who possesses the full moon. As the moon when freed from cloud, freed from mist, freed from smoke and dust, delivered from the clutches of the Eclipse-Demon Rāhu, gleams and glows and shines, so too the bhikkhu who is delivered from all defilements gleams and glows and shines. Hence “just like the full moon free from cloud” was said.</p>
<p>These are the thirteen kinds of knowledge of cleansing.</p>

<h3>Commentary on Introductory Paragraph</h3>
<p>184. <i>Here</i>: in this view, in this choice, in this preference, in this selection, in this True Idea, in this Discipline (vinaya), in this field of True Idea and Discipline, in this doctrine, in this Good Life, in this Master's Dispensation. Hence “here” is said.</p>
<p>185. <i>A bhikkhu</i>: a bhikkhu is a magnanimous ordinary man or an Initiate or an Arahant who has reached the unassailable idea.</p>
<p>186. <i>Forest</i>: having gone out beyond the boundary post, all that is forest.</p>
<p>187. <i>Root of a tree</i>: where the bhikkhu's seat is prepared, or his bed or his chair or his mattress or his mat or his piece of hide or his spread of grass or his spread of leaves, or his spread of straw, there he walks or stands or sits or lies down.</p>
<p>188. <i>Empty</i>: unfrequented by laymen or by those gone forth into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en177' href='#pts-vp-en177'>PTS vp En 177</a>189. <i>Place</i>: dwelling, lean-to, mansion, villa, cave.</p>
<p>190. <i>Sits down</i>; having folded his legs crosswise: he is seated, having folded his legs crosswise.</p>
<p>191. <i>Set his body erect</i>: his body is erect, <span class='add'>[firmly]</span> placed, properly disposed.</p>
<p>192. <i>Established mindfulness in front of him</i> (<i>parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā</i>): <i>pari</i> has the sense of embracing; <i>mukhaṃ</i> (lit. mouth) has the sense of outlet; <i>sati</i> (mindfulness) has the sense of establishment (foundation). Hence “<i>parimukhaṃ satiṃ upaṭṭhapetvā</i> (established mindfulness in front of him)” is said.</p>
<p>193. <i>Ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out</i>: he is a mindful worker in thirty-two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) When he knows unification of cognizance and non-distraction through breathing in long, mindfulness is established (founded) in him; by means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker. (2) When he knows unification of cognizance and non-distraction through breathing out long, … (32) When he knows unification of cognizance and non-distraction through breathing out contemplating relinquishment, mindfulness is established (founded) in him; by means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker.</p>

<p><i>194. How is it that (1) breathing in long, he knows “I breathe in long” (2) breathing out long, he knows “I breathe out long”?</i></p>
<h4>Analysis of Knowledge of the Object of Contemplation</h4>
<p>195. (a) He breathes in a long in-breath reckoned by extent. (b) He breathes out a long out-breath reckoned by extent. (c) He breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths reckoned by extent. As he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and long out-breaths reckoned by extent, zeal arises. (d) Through zeal he breathes in a long in-breath more subtle than before reckoned by extent. (e) Through zeal he breathes out a long out-breath more subtle than before reckoned by extent. (f) Through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned by extent. As, through zeal, he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned by extent, gladness arises. (g) Through gladness he breathes in a long in-breath more subtle than before reckoned by extent. (h) Through gladness he breathes out a long out-breath more subtle than before reckoned by extent. (i) Through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en178' href='#pts-vp-en178'>PTS vp En 178</a> in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned by extent. As, through gladness, he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned by extent, his cognizance turns away from the long in-breaths and out-breaths, and equanimity is established.</p>
<h4>The Foundation of Mindfulness</h4>
<p>196. Long in-breaths and out-breaths in these nine aspects are a body. The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness. The contemplation is knowledge. The body is the establishment (foundation), but it is not the mindfulness. Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the mindfulness. By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body. Hence “Development of the Foundation (Establishment) of Mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body” is said.</p>
<p>197. <i>He contemplates</i> how does he contemplate that body? He contemplates it as impermanent, not as permanent; as painful, not as pleasant; as not self, not as self; he becomes dispassionate, does not delight; he causes greed to fade away, does not inflame it; he causes cessation, not arising; he relinquishes, does not grasp. When he contemplates as impermanent he abandons perception of permanence, when he contemplates as painful he abandons perception of pleasure, when he contemplates as not self he abandons perception of self, when he becomes dispassionate he abandons delight, when his greed fades away he abandons greed, when he causes cessation he abandons arising, when he relinquishes he abandons grasping. Thus he contemplates the body.</p>
<p>198. <i>Development</i>: there are four kinds of development: development in the sense of non-excess of ideas produced therein, development in the sense of single function (taste) of the faculties, development in the sense of effectiveness of the appropriate energy, and development in the sense of repetition.</p>
<h4>Exercise of Mindfulness and Full-Awareness</h4>
<p>199. When he understands unification of cognizance and non-distraction through long in-breaths and out-breaths, his feelings are recognized as they arise, recognized as they appear (are established), recognized as they subside; his perceptions are recognized as they arise, recognized as they appear (are established), recognized as they subside; his applied-thoughts are recognized as they arise, recognized as they appear (are established), recognized as they subside.</p>

This is how the appearance of feeling is recognized.</p>
<p>How is the subsiding of feeling recognized? The subsiding of feeling is recognized in the sense of conditioned cessation thus: With the cessation of ignorance there is the cessation of feeling.

Also when he sees the characteristic of change he has recognized the subsiding of feeling. This is how the subsiding of feeling is recognized.</p>
<p>This is how feelings are recognized as they arise, recognized as they appear, and recognized as they subside.</p>
<p>201. How are <i>perceptions</i> recognized as they arise, recognized as they appear, recognized as they subside?</p>
<p>How is the arising of perception recognized? The arising of perception is recognized in the sense of conditioned arising thus: With the arising of ignorance there is the arising of perception … With the arising of craving … With the arising of contact … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 200 up to the end]</span>.</p>

<h4>The Foundation of Mindfulness</h4>
<p>219. Short in-breaths and out-breaths in these nine aspects are a body. The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness. The contemplation is knowledge. The body is the establishment (foundation), but it is not the mindfulness. Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the mindfulness. By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body. Hence “Development of the Foundation (Establishment) of Mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body” is said.</p>

<h4>Analysis of the Object of Contemplation</h4>
<p>240. <i>Body</i>: there are two bodies: the mental body and the material body. What is the mental body? Feeling, perception, volition, contact, attention, and mentality are the mental body, and also what are called cognizance formations: these are the mental body.</p>
<p>What is the material body? The four great entities and the materiality derived by clinging from the four great entities, in-breath and out-breath and the sign for anchoring <span class='add'>[mindfulness]</span>, and also what are called body formations: this is the material body.</p>
<p>241. How is he acquainted with these bodies? When he understands unification of cognizance and non-distraction through long in-breaths, his mindfulness is established (founded). By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he is acquainted with those bodies. When he understands unification of cognizance and non-distraction through long out-breaths, … through short in-breaths, … through short out-breaths, his mindfulness is established (founded). By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he is acquainted with those bodies.</p>

That is how those bodies are experienced.</p>
<h4>The Foundation of Mindfulness</h4>
<p>243. In-breaths and out-breaths while acquainted with the whole body <span class='add'>[of breaths]</span> are a body. The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness. The contemplation is knowledge. The body is the establishment (foundation), but it is not the mindfulness. Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the mindfulness. By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body. Hence “Development of the Foundation (Establishment) of Mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body” is said.</p>

<h4>Training</h4>
<p>246.

<p><i>265. How is it that (7) he trains thus “I shall breathe in tranquillizing the body formation”; (8) he trains thus “I shall breathe out tranquillizing the body formation”?</i></p>
<h4>Analysis of the Object of Contemplation</h4>
<p>266. What is the <i>body formation</i>? Long in-breaths are of the body; these things, being bound up with the body, are body formations; he trains in tranquillizing, stopping, stilling, those body formations. Long out-breaths belong to the body; … Short in-breaths belong to the body; … Short out-breaths belong to the body; … In-breaths while acquainted with the whole body <span class='add'>[of breaths]</span> belong to the body; … Out-breaths while acquainted with the whole body <span class='add'>[of breaths]</span> belong to the body; these things, being bound up with the body, are body formations; he trains in tranquillizing, stopping, stilling, those body formations.</p>
<p>When there are such body formations whereby there is bending backwards, sideways, in all directions, and forwards, and perturbation, excitement, moving, and shaking, of the body, he trains thus “I shall breathe in tranquillizing the body formation”, he trains thus “I shall breathe out tranquillizing the body formation”. When there are such body formations whereby there is no bending backwards, sideways, in all directions, and forwards, and no perturbation, excitement, moving, and shaking, of the body, quiet and subtle, he trains thus “I shall breathe in tranquillizing the body formation”, he trains thus “I shall breathe out tranquillizing the body formation”.</p>
<p>So then he trains thus “I shall breathe in tranquillizing the body formation”, he trains thus “I shall breathe out tranquillizing the body formation”: that being so, there is no production of experience of wind, and there is no production of in-breaths and out-breaths, and there is no production of mindfulness of breathing, and there is no production of concentration by mindfulness of breathing, and consequently the wise neither enter into nor emerge from that attainment.</p>
<p>So then he trains thus “I shall breathe in tranquillizing the body formation”, he trains thus “I shall breathe out tranquillizing the body formation”: that being so, there is production of experience of wind, and there is production of out-breaths and in-breaths, and there is production of mindfulness of breathing, and there is production of concentration by <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en186' href='#pts-vp-en186'>PTS vp En 186</a> mindfulness of breathing, and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment.
