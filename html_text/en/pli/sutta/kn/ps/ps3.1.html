<p>“Bhikkhus, these four ideas, when developed and made much of, lead to realization of the fruit of arahantship …”</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, these four ideas, when developed and made much of, lead to obtainment of understanding, to awakening of understanding, to abundance of understanding, to the state of great understanding, to the state of wide understanding, to the state of abundant understanding, to the state of profound understanding, to the state of unequalled understanding, to the state of over-all understanding, to the state of much understanding, to the state of quick understanding, to the state of rapid (light) understanding, to the state of laughing understanding, to the state of impulsive understanding, to the state of keen understanding, to the state of penetrative understanding. What four? Waiting on good men, hearing the True Idea, careful attention, and practice in accordance with the True Idea. These four ideas, when developed and made much of, lead to obtainment of understanding, … to penetrative understanding”.</p>
<p>5. <i>Lead to obtainment of understanding</i>: What is obtainment of understanding? It is the attaining, obtaining, reaching, achieving, sounding, realizing and undertaking of the four kinds of path knowledge, the four <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en367' href='#pts-vp-en367'>PTS vp En 367</a> kinds of fruition knowledge, the four kinds of discrimination knowledge, the six kinds of direct knowledge, the seventy-three kinds of knowledge (Tr. I), the seventy-seven kinds of knowledge. They lead to the obtainment of understanding: this is obtainment of understanding.</p>
<p>6. <i>Lead to awakening of understanding</i>: What is awakening of understanding? In the seven kinds of initiate and in the magnanimous ordinary man understanding increases; in the arahant understanding <span class='add'>[has]</span> increase<span class='add'>[d]</span>. Increases lead to awakening of understanding: this is awakening of understanding.</p>
<p>7. <i>Lead to abundance of understanding</i>: What is abundance of understanding? In the seven kinds of initiate and in the magnanimous ordinary man understanding comes to abundance; in the arahant understanding has come to abundance. They lead to abundance of understanding: this is abundance of understanding.</p>
<p>8. <i>Lead to the state of great understanding</i>: what is great understanding? It embraces the great meanings, thus it is great understanding. It embraces the great ideas, thus it is great understanding. It embraces the great languages, thus it is great understanding. It embraces the great perspicuities, thus it is great understanding. It embraces the great Virtue Aggregates … the great Concentration Aggregates … the great Understanding Aggregates … the great Deliverance Aggregates … the great Knowledge-and-Seeing-of-Deliverance Aggregates … the great possibles and impossibles … the great abidings and attainments … the great noble actualities … the great foundations of mindfulness … the great right endeavours … the great roads to power (bases for success) … the great faculties … the great powers … the great enlightenment factors … the great noble path … the great noble fruits of asceticism … the great direct knowledges … the great ultimate meaning, nibbana, thus it is great understanding. They lead to the state of great understanding: this is great understanding.</p>
<p>9. <i>Lead to the state of wide understanding</i>: What is wide understanding? Knowledge about widely separate aggregates occurs, thus it is wide understanding. Knowledge about widely separate principles occurs, thus it is wide understanding. Knowledge about widely separate bases … about widely separate dependent originations … about widely separate ideas unapprehendable owing to voidness … about widely separate meanings … about widely separate ideas … about widely separate languages … about widely separate perspicuities … about widely separate virtue aggregates … concentration aggregates … understanding aggregates … liberation aggregates … knowledge-and-seeing-of-deliverance aggregates … possibles and impossibles … abidings and attainments … noble actualities … foundations <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en368' href='#pts-vp-en368'>PTS vp En 368</a> of mindfulness … right endeavours … roads to power (bases for success) … faculties … powers … enlightenment factors … noble paths … fruits of asceticism … Knowledge about widely separate direct knowledges occurs, thus it is wide understanding. Knowledge about the ultimate meaning, nibbana, occurs, having surmounted the ideas widely separated shared by ordinary men, thus it is wide understanding. They lead to the state of wide understanding: this is wide understanding.</p>
<p>10. <i>Lead to the state of abundant understanding</i>: what is abundant understanding? It embraces abundant meanings, thus it is abundant understanding. It embraces abundant ideas, thus it is abundant understanding. It embraces abundant languages, … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 8 up to]</span> … It embraces abundant direct knowledges, thus it is abundant understanding. It embraces the ultimate meaning, nibbana, thus it is abundant understanding. They lead to the state of abundant understanding: this is abundant understanding.</p>
<p>11. <i>Lead to the state of profound understanding</i>: what is profound understanding? Knowledge about profound aggregates occurs, thus it is profound understanding. Knowledge about profound principles occurs, thus it is profound understanding. Knowledge about profound bases … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 9 up to]</span> … … Knowledge about profound direct knowledges occurs, thus it is profound understanding. Knowledge about the ultimate meaning, nibbana, occurs, thus it is profound understanding. They lead to the state of profound understanding: this is profound understanding.</p>
<p>12. <i>Lead to the state of unequalled understanding</i>: what is unequalled understanding? When a <span class='add'>[noble]</span> person has arrived at, realized and sounded the discrimination of meanings by definition of meanings, has arrived at, realized and sounded the discrimination of ideas by definition of ideas, has arrived at, realized and sounded the discrimination of language by definition of languages, has arrived at, realized and sounded the discrimination of perspicuity by definition of perspicuities, then no one else <span class='add'>[who is an ordinary man]</span> can reach his meanings, ideas, languages and perspicuities, he being unreachable by others <span class='add'>[who are ordinary men]</span>, thus it is unequalled understanding.</p>
<p>The understanding of a magnanimous ordinary man is far from, far distant from, very far distant from, not near to, not equal to, the understanding of the Eighth <span class='add'>[Person, who has the stream entry path]</span>; compared to the magnanimous ordinary man the Eighth has unequalled understanding. The understanding of the Eighth is far from … not equal to, the understanding of a Stream Enterer; compared to the Eighth the Stream <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en369' href='#pts-vp-en369'>PTS vp En 369</a> Enterer has unequalled understanding. The understanding of the Stream Enterer is far from, … not equal to, the understanding of the Once-returner; compared to the Stream Enterer the Once-returner has unequalled understanding. The understanding of the Once-returner is far from, … is not equal to, the understanding of the Non-returner; compared to the Once-returner the Non-returner has unequalled understanding. The understanding of the Non-returner is far from, … not equal to, the understanding of the Arahant; compared to the Non-returner the Arahant has unequalled understanding. The understanding of the Arahant is far from, … not equal to, the understanding of the Pacceka Buddha; compared to the Arahant the Pacceka Buddha has unequalled understanding.</p>
<p>Compared with a Pacceka Buddha and the world with its deities a Perfect One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is the highest with unequalled understanding; he is skilled in the categories of understanding, has every category of knowledge, has arrived at the discriminations, has reached the four kinds of assurance, wields the ten powers, is the man bull, the man lion, the man tusker, the man thoroughbred, the man burden-drawer, with unlimited knowledge, unlimited vigour, unlimited fame, rich <span class='add'>[in knowledge]</span>, wealthy <span class='add'>[in knowledge]</span>, prosperous <span class='add'>[in knowledge]</span>, the leader, the leader away (discipliner), leader along <span class='add'>[the way of the True Idea]</span>, who causes understanding, causes pondering, causes regard, and causes confidence. “For that Blessed One is the Arouser of the unarisen Path, the Producer of the unproduced Path, the Declarer of the undeclared Path, the Path Knower, Path Seer, Skilled in the Path; but now when the disciples dwelling in conformity with the Path become possessed of it, they do so following after him”. “For that Blessed One knows what is to be known, sees what is to be seen; he is the Eye, the Knowledge, the True Idea, the Divine (brahma), the Mover, the Maintainer, the Bringer of Good, the Giver of the Deathless, the Lord of the True Idea, The Perfect One”. There is nothing that the Blessed One has not known, has not seen, has not recognized, has not realized, has not sounded with understanding, including the past, the future and the presently-arisen. All ideas come into the focus of the Blessed One's knowledge in all aspects. Whatever there is knowable that can be known—a meaning belonging to himself or a meaning belonging to another or a meaning belonging to both or a meaning belonging to the here and now or a meaning belonging to the life to come or an evident meaning or a profound meaning or a cryptic meaning or a revealed meaning or a deducible meaning or a direct meaning or a blameless meaning or an undefiled meaning or a cleansing meaning or an ultimate-meaning meaning—all that is available within the Buddha-knowledge. All body <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en370' href='#pts-vp-en370'>PTS vp En 370</a> action is available to the Buddha's knowledge, all speech action is available to the Buddha's knowledge, all mind action is available to the Buddha's knowledge. The Buddha's knowledge of the past is unobstructed, the Buddha's knowledge about the future is unobstructed, the Buddha's knowledge about the presently arisen is unobstructed. As much as is knowable, so much is his knowledge; as much as is his knowledge, so much is knowable; his knowledge is co-extensive with the knowable, and the knowable is co-extensive with his knowledge; his knowledge does not exceed the knowable, and there is nothing knowable that exceeds his knowledge; these ideas are co-extensive with each other. Just as, when two congruent surfaces are in close contact, the lower congruent surface does not exceed the upper congruent surface nor the upper the lower but both are co-extensive with each other, so too, for the Buddha, the Blessed One, the knowable and the knowledge are ideas co-extensive with each other. As much as is knowable, so much is his knowledge; … <span class='add'>[as above]</span> … these ideas are co-extensive with each other. The Buddha's knowledge reaches all ideas; all ideas are available to the adverting of the Buddha, the Blessed One, available to his wish, available to his attention, available to his thought-arising. The Buddha's knowledge reaches all beings; the Buddha knows the biasses of all beings, their underlying tendencies, their temperaments, their resolutions, he understands them as with little dust on their eyes, as with much dust on their eyes, as with keen faculties, as with dull faculties, as of good parts, as of bad parts, as easy to instruct, as hard to instruct, as capable and incapable. The world with its deities, its Māras and its Brahmā Gods, this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, with its princes and men occurs within the sphere of the Buddha-knowledge. Just as any fishes and turtles including even the biggest sea-monster are contained within the great ocean, so too, this world … occurs within the sphere of the Buddha-knowledge. Just as any winged creatures including even the Venateyya Garuḷa are contained within a part of space, so too, even those possessed of understanding equal to Sāriputta are contained within a part of the Buddha-knowledge. The Buddha-knowledge reaches the understanding of deities and human beings and overtakes it. Even those Khattiya scholars, Brahman scholars, householder scholars, ascetic scholars, who are clever and know others' theories as a hair-splitter <span class='add'>[knows archery]</span>, who must, one would think, go about breaking down <span class='add'>[wrong]</span> views with the understanding that they have—even they, when they have contrived a problem and approached the Perfect One and asked cryptic and hidden <span class='add'>[questions]</span>, have their questions explained and answered by the Blessed One with the reasons made clear, and they become the Blessed One's converts; and then the Blessed One himself shines forth exceedingly <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en371' href='#pts-vp-en371'>PTS vp En 371</a> there in understanding. Thus he is the highest of those with unequalled understanding. They lead to the state of unequalled understanding: this is unequalled understanding.</p>
<p>13. <i>Lead to the state of over-all understanding:</i> what is over-all understanding? It overcomes (<i>abhibhuyyati</i>) greed, thus it is over-all (<i>bhūri</i>) understanding; it has overcome, thus it is over-all understanding. It overcomes hate …; it has overcome, … It overcomes delusion …; it has overcome delusion … It overcomes anger … enmity … contempt … domineering … envy … avarice … deceit … fraud … obduracy … presumption … pride (conceit) … haughtiness … vanity … negligence … all defilements … all misconduct … all action-formations … It overcomes all action that leads to being, thus it is over-all understanding; it has overcome, thus it is over-all understanding.</p>
<p>Greed is a foe (<i>ari</i>); it crushes that foe: thus it is over-all (<i>bhūri</i>=<i>bhū-ari</i>) understanding. Hate is a foe; it crushes that foe: thus it is over-all understanding. Delusion is a foe … anger … enmity … contempt … domineering … envy … avarice … deceit … fraud … obduracy … presumption … pride (conceit) … haughtiness … vanity … negligence … all defilements … all misconduct … all action-formations … All action that leads to being is a foe; it crushes that foe: thus it is over-all understanding.</p>
<p>The Earth is called the “Over-All” (<i>bhūri</i>); he is possessed of understanding that is abundant, extended like the Earth: thus it is over-all understanding. Furthermore, these are terms for understanding, namely, the Over-All (<i>bhūri</i>=<i>bhūte atthe ramati</i> <span class='add'>[Comy.]</span>), Wisdom, and the Guide: thus it is over-all understanding.</p>
<p>They lead to the state of over-all understanding, this is over-all understanding.</p>
<p>14. <i>Lead to the state of much understanding</i>: what is much understanding? Here there is someone to whom understanding is important, who has the temperament of understanding, who has the bias of understanding, who is resolute upon understanding, whose flag is understanding, whose banner is understanding, in whom understanding is dominant, who has much investigation, who has much scrutiny, who has much examination, who has much the manner of observing, whose idea is observing, who abides in the evident, whose temperament is that, who gives that importance, who has that in plenty, who tends to that, who inclines to that, who leans to that, who is resolute upon that, in whom that is dominant.</p>
<p>Just as one to whom a class <span class='add'>[of students]</span> is important is called “One much with a class”, as one to whom a robe is important is called “One much with a robe”, as one to whom a bowl is important is called “One <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en372' href='#pts-vp-en372'>PTS vp En 372</a> much with a bowl”, as one to whom a resting place is important is called “One much with a resting place”, so too here there is someone to whom understanding is important, who has the temperament of understanding, … <span class='add'>[as above]</span> in whom that is dominant. They lead to the state of much understanding: this is much understanding.</p>
<p>15. <i>Lead to the state of quick understanding</i>: what is quick understanding? It very quickly perfects the virtues, thus it is quick understanding. It very quickly perfects restraint of the faculties, thus it is quick understanding. It very quickly perfects knowledge of the right amount in eating … devotion to wakefulness … the virtue aggregate … the concentration aggregate … the understanding aggregate … the deliverance aggregate … the knowledge-and-seeing-of-deliverance aggregate. It very quickly penetrates the possibles and impossibles, thus it is quick understanding. It very quickly perfects the abidings and attainments, … It very quickly penetrates the noble actualities, … It very quickly develops the foundations of mindfulness, … It very quickly develops the right endeavours, … It very quickly develops the roads to power (bases for success), … It very quickly develops the faculties, … It very quickly develops the powers, … It very quickly develops the enlightenment factors, … It very quickly develops the path, … It very quickly realizes the fruits of asceticism, … It very quickly penetrates the direct knowledges, … It very quickly realizes the ultimate meaning, nibbana, thus it is quick understanding. They lead to the state of quick understanding: this is quick understanding.</p>
<p>16. <i>Lead to rapid (light) understanding</i>: what is rapid (light) understanding? It very rapidly perfects the virtues, thus it is rapid understanding. It very rapidly perfects restraint of the faculties, … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 15 up to]</span> … It very rapidly realizes the ultimate meaning, nibbana, thus it is rapid (light) understanding. They lead to the state of rapid (light) understanding: this is rapid (light) understanding.</p>
<p>17. <i>Lead to the state of laughing understanding</i>: what is laughing understanding? Here someone with much laughter, blitheness, content and gladness perfects the virtues, thus it is laughing understanding. With much laughter, blitheness, content and gladness he perfects restraint of the faculties, … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 15 up to]</span> … With much laughter, blitheness, content and gladness he realizes the ultimate meaning, nibbana, thus it is laughing understanding. They lead to the state of laughing understanding: this is laughing understanding.</p>
<p>18. <i>Lead to the state of impulsive understanding</i>: what is impulsive understanding?</p>
<p>Any materiality whatever, whether past, future or presently-arisen, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en373' href='#pts-vp-en373'>PTS vp En 373</a> internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—it soon gives the impulse that all materiality is impermanent, thus it is impulsive understanding; it soon gives the impulse that it is painful, thus it is impulsive understanding; it soon gives the impulse that it is not self, thus it is impulsive understanding. Any feeling whatever, … <span class='add'>[and so on with the 201 ideas listed in Tr. I § 5 up to]</span> … Any ageing-and-death whatever, whether past, future or presently-arisen, … it soon gives the impulse that it is impermanent, thus it is impulsive understanding; it soon gives the impulse that it is painful, thus it is impulsive understanding; it soon gives the impulse that it is not self, thus it is impulsive understanding.</p>
<p>Having calculated and judged and clarified and made clear that past, future and presently-arisen materiality is impermanent in the sense of destruction, painful in the sense of terror, and not self in the sense of having no core, it soon gives the impulse to the cessation of materiality, nibbana, thus it is impulsive understanding. Having calculated and judged and clarified and made clear that past, future and presently-arisen materiality is impermanent, formed, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to fall, subject to fading away, subject to cessation, it soon gives the impulse to the cessation of materiality, nibbana, thus it is impulsive understanding. Having calculated and judged and clarified and made clear that past, future and present feeling … <span class='add'>[and so on with the rest of the 201 ideas listed in Tr. I § 5 up to]</span> … Having calculated … that past, future and presently-arisen ageing-and-death is impermanent in the sense of destruction … subject to cessation, it soon gives the impulse to the cessation of ageing-and-death, nibbana, thus it is impulsive understanding. They lead to the state of impulsive understanding: this is impulsive understanding.</p>
<p>19. <i>Lead to the state of keen understanding</i>: what is keen understanding? It soon severs defilements, thus it is keen understanding. It does not endure an arisen thought of sense-desire, abandons it, removes it, eliminates it, annihilates it, thus it is keen understanding. It does not endure an arisen thought of ill-will, … an arisen thought of cruelty, abandons it, removes it, eliminates it, annihilates it, thus it is keen understanding. Whenever evil unprofitable ideas arise, it does not endure them, abandons them, removes them, eliminates them, annihilates them, thus it is keen understanding. It does not endure arisen greed, … hate, … delusion, … anger, … enmity, … contempt, … domineering, … envy, … avarice, … deceit, … fraud, … obduracy, … presumption, … pride (conceit), … haughtiness, … vanity, … negligence, … any defilements, … any misconduct, … any action-formations, … It does not endure any action that leads to being, abandons it, removes it, eliminates it, annihilates it, thus it is keen understanding. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en374' href='#pts-vp-en374'>PTS vp En 374</a> In a single session the four paths and the four fruits of asceticism and the four discriminations and the six direct knowledges are acquired, realized and sounded with understanding, thus it is keen understanding. They lead to the state of keen understanding: this is keen understanding.</p>
<p>20. <i>Lead to the state of penetrative understanding</i>: what is penetrative understanding? Here someone has much sense of urgency about all formations, much fear, much dissatisfaction, much boredom, much disenchantment, has no enjoyment externally in any formations; he penetrates, explodes the mass of greed never penetrated, never exploded before, thus it is penetrative understanding. He penetrates, explodes the mass of hate … mass of delusion … mass of anger … enmity … contempt … domineering … envy … avarice … deceit … fraud … obduracy … presumption … pride (conceit) … haughtiness … vanity … negligence … all defilements … all misconduct … all action-formations … He penetrates, explodes all action that leads to being never penetrated and exploded before, thus it is penetrative understanding. They lead to the state of penetrative understanding: this is penetrative understanding.</p>
<p>21. There are sixteen kinds of understanding. The person possessed of these sixteen kinds of understanding has reached the discriminations.</p>
<p>22. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations: one has had previous practice <span class='add'>[in former lives]</span>, and the other has not. He who has had previous practice surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible <span class='add'>[in two]</span>.</p>
<p>23. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and two who have had previous practice: one is well taught and the other is not. He who is well taught surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible.</p>
<p>24. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and two who have had previous practice, and two who are well taught: one does much teaching and the other does not. He who does much teaching surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible.</p>
<p>25. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and two who have had previous practice, and two who are well taught, and two who do much teaching: one is dependent upon a teacher, and the other is not. He who is dependent upon a teacher surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible.</p>
<p>26. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and who have had previous practice, and who are well taught, and who do much teaching, and who are dependent upon a teacher: one abides much <span class='add'>[in insight and fruition]</span>, and the other does not. He who abides much <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en375' href='#pts-vp-en375'>PTS vp En 375</a> surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible.</p>
<p>27. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and who have had previous practice, and who are well taught, and who do much teaching, and who are dependent upon a teacher, and who abide much: one does much reviewing, and the other does not: He who does much reviewing surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible.</p>
<p>28. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and who have had previous practice, and who are well taught, and who do much teaching, and who are dependent upon a teacher, and who abide much, and who do much reviewing: one has reached the initiates' discriminations, and the other has reached the adepts' discriminations. He who has reached the adepts' discriminations surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible.</p>
<p>29. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and who have had previous practice, and who are well taught, and who do much teaching, and who are dependent upon a teacher, and who abide much, and who do much reviewing, and who have reached the adepts' discriminations: one has reached the disciples' perfections, and the other has not. He who has reached the disciples' perfections surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible.</p>
<p>30. There are two kinds of persons who have reached the discriminations, and who have had previous practice, and who are well taught, and who do much teaching, and who are dependent upon a teacher, and who abide much, and who do much reviewing, and who have reached the adepts' discriminations: one who has reached the disciples' perfections, and one who is a Pacceka Buddha. He who is a Pacceka Buddha surpasses the other, exceeds him, is more distinguished; and his knowledge is divisible. Compared with a Pacceka Buddha and the world with its deities a Perfect One, accomplished and fully enlightened, is the highest who has reached the discriminations; he is skilled in the categories of understanding, … <span class='add'>[and so on as in § 12 up to]</span> … and then the Blessed One himself shines forth exceedingly there in understanding. Thus he is the highest of those who have reached the discriminations.</p>
