<h1>14. Sariputta Bhante’s Mother</h1>
</header>
<p>Sariputta Bhante sees a female ghost and asks,</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Sariputta Bhante:</span></p>
<p>You are naked and very ugly. Your veins are popping out. You thin person, with your ribs sticking out, who are you?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Ghost:</span></p>
<p>I was your mother in a previous life. Now I am living in the ghost world suffering from hunger and thirst. My food is saliva, mucus, phlegm, the fat of burning bodies, the blood of women giving birth, blood of wounds, pus, and the blood from shaving wounds. I can only feed on the pus and blood of humans and animals. I do not have of a house of my own, therefore I stay in the cemetery. Oh my son, please offer alms to monks and dedicate that merit to me. Then I will be free from eating pus and blood.</p>
<p>Having heard what his mother said, the compassionate Sariputta Bhante called Moggallana Bhante, Narada Bhante, and Kappina Bhante. Sariputta Bhante built four huts and offered those huts along with food and drink to the whole community of monks and dedicated the merit to his mother.</p>
<p>The result of this donation immediately took effect in the form of food, drink, and clothing for the ghost. She became pure, wearing the cleanest and finest clothes with jewelry. Then she approached Moggallana Bhante.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Moggallana Bhante:</span></p>
<p>Who are you, with heavenly beauty, shining in all directions like a star? Why are you so beautiful? What merit have you collected when you were a human?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Ghost:</span></p>
<p>I was your mother in a previous live. I was reborn in the ghost world suffering from hunger and thirst. My food was saliva, mucus, phlegm, the fat of burning bodies, the blood of women giving birth, the blood of wounds, pus, and the blood from shaving wounds. I could only feed on the pus and blood of humans and animals. I did not have a house of my own, therefore I stayed in the cemetery.</p>
<p>I am very happy now, rejoicing in Sariputta Bhante’s gift. I do not fear anything. I have come here to worship the compassionate Sariputta Bhante.</p>
