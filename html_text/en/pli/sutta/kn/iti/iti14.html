<h1>14. Ignorance</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, I do not perceive any single hindrance other than the hindrance of ignorance by which humankind is so obstructed and for so long a time runs on and wanders in saṃsāra. It is indeed through the hindrance of ignorance that humankind is obstructed and for a long time runs on and wanders in saṃsāra.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>No other single thing exists<br>
Like the hindrance of delusion,<br>
Which so obstructs humankind<br>
And makes it wander on forever.</p>
<p>Those who have abandoned delusion,<br>
Cleaving through this mass of darkness,<br>
No longer roam and wander on;<br>
In them the cause is found no more.</p>
</blockquote>
