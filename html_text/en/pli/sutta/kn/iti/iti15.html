<h1>15. Craving</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, I do not perceive any single fetter other than the fetter of craving by which beings are so tied and for so long a time run on and wander in saṃsāra. It is indeed through the fetter of craving that beings are tied and for a long time run on and wander in saṃsāra.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>A man companioned by craving<br>
Wanders on this long journey;<br>
He cannot go beyond saṃsāra<br>
In this state of being or another.</p>
<p>Having understood the danger thus—<br>
That craving is the origin of suffering—<br>
A bhikkhu should wander mindfully,<br>
Free from craving, without grasping.</p>
</blockquote>
