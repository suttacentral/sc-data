<h1>40. Knowledge</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Ignorance, bhikkhus, precedes and leads to unwholesome states, and shamelessness and lack of fear of wrongdoing follow after. Knowledge, bhikkhus, precedes and leads to wholesome states, and shame and fear of wrongdoing follow after.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Whatever bad bourns there are<br>
In this world and hereafter,<br>
All are rooted in ignorance,<br>
Constructed by desire and greed.</p>
<p>Since one of evil desires<br>
Is shameless and disrespectful,<br>
From that evil flows forth<br>
And he goes to a state of misery.</p>
<p>Thus by discarding desire and greed,<br>
Along with ignorance as well,<br>
A bhikkhu arouses knowledge<br>
And abandons all bad bourns.</p>
