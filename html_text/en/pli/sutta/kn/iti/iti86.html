<h1>86. Practice According to Dhamma</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“When referring to a bhikkhu who practises according to Dhamma, this is the proper way of defining ‘practice according to Dhamma.’ When speaking he speaks only Dhamma, not non-Dhamma. When thinking he thinks only thoughts of Dhamma, not thoughts of non-Dhamma. By avoiding these two he lives with equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>A bhikkhu enjoying the Dhamma<br>
And delighting in the Dhamma,<br>
Reflecting upon the Dhamma,<br>
Does not fall from the true Dhamma.</p>
<p>Whether walking or standing,<br>
Sitting or lying down,<br>
With mind inwardly restrained,<br>
He attains to lasting peace.</p>
</blockquote>
