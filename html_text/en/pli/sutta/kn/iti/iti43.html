<h1>43. The Not-born</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“There is, bhikkhus, a not-born, a not-brought-to-being, a not-made, a not-conditioned. If, bhikkhus, there were no not-born, not-brought-to-being, not-made, not-conditioned, no escape would be discerned from what is born, brought-to-being, made, conditioned. But since there is a not-born, a not-brought-to-being, a not-made, a not-conditioned, therefore an escape is discerned from what is born, brought-to-being, made, conditioned.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The born, come-to-be, produced,<br>
The made, the conditioned, the transient,<br>
Conjoined with decay and death,<br>
A nest of disease, perishable,<br>
Sprung from nutriment and craving’s cord—<br>
That is not fit to take delight in.</p>
<p>The escape from that, the peaceful,<br>
Beyond reasoning, everlasting,<br>
The not-born, the unproduced,<br>
The sorrowless state that is void of stain,<br>
The cessation of states linked to suffering,<br>
The stilling of the conditioned—bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
