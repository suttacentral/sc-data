<h1>57. Taints (2)</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three taints …”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>One for whom the taint of desire<br>
For sensual pleasures has been destroyed,<br>
Who has eliminated ignorance<br>
And exhausted the taint of being—<br>
Such a one is released without clinging.<br>
Having conquered Māra and his mount,<br>
He bears his final body.</p>
