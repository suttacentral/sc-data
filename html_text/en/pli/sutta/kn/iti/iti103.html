<h1>103. Recluses and Brahmins</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, whatever recluses and brahmins do not understand as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’; ‘This is the origin of suffering’; ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; ‘This is the course leading to the cessation of suffering’—these recluses and brahmins are not considered by me to be true recluses among recluses, to be true brahmins among brahmins. These venerable ones live without having realized and achieved here and now by their own direct knowledge the aim of being a recluse, the aim of being a brahmin.</p>
<p>“But, bhikkhus, whatever recluses and brahmins understand as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’; ‘This is the origin of suffering’; ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; ‘This is the course leading to the cessation of suffering’—these recluses and brahmins are considered by me to be true recluses among recluses, to be true brahmins among brahmins. These venerable ones indeed live having achieved and realized here and now by their own direct knowledge the aim of being a recluse, the aim of being a brahmin.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Those who do not understand suffering,<br>
Or how suffering is produced,<br>
Or where suffering finally stops<br>
Altogether without remainder,<br>
And who do not know that path<br>
Leading to relief from suffering—<br>
They are destitute of mind-release<br>
And lack release by wisdom too;<br>
Unable to make an end of it,<br>
They fare on in birth and decay.</p>
<p>But those who understand suffering,<br>
And how suffering is produced,<br>
And where suffering finally stops<br>
Altogether without remainder,<br>
And who also know that path<br>
Leading to relief from suffering—<br>
They possess that mind-release<br>
And the release by wisdom too;<br>
Able to make an end of it<br>
They never come back to birth and decay.</p>
