<h1>The Discourse about Subhūti</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Subhūti was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, having attained a concentration free from thought. The Gracious One saw venerable Subhūti sat not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, who had attained a concentration free from thought.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“For he who has dispelled thoughts,<br>
Totally cut <span class='add'>them</span> off within himself without remainder,<br>
Perceiving the formless <span class='add'>nibbāna</span>, beyond the shackle,<br>
Having overcome the four yokes—he surely does not come <span class='add'>to birth again</span>.”</p>
</blockquote>
