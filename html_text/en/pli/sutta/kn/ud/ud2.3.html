<h1>The Discourse about the Stick</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then at that time many young boys who were between Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Wood were attacking a snake with a stick. Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, was entering Sāvatthī for alms. The Gracious One saw <span class='add'>those</span> many young boys between Sāvatthī and Jeta’s Wood attacking a snake with a stick. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“He who, while seeking happiness for himself,<br>
harms with a stick <span class='add'>Other</span> beings who desire happiness,<br>
will not find happiness after passing away.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“He who, while seeking happiness for himself,<br>
does not harm with a stick <span class='add'>Other</span> beings who desire happiness,<br>
will find happiness after passing away.”</p>
</blockquote>
