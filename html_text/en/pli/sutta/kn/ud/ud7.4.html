<h1>The Second Discourse about Clinging</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time almost all the people in Sāvatthī clung to sense pleasures, delighted, greedy, tied, infatuated, indulgent and blinded, they dwelt having become completely intoxicated with sense pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. The Gracious One saw that almost all the people in Sāvatthī clung to sense pleasures, delighted, greedy, tied, infatuated, indulgent and blinded, and dwelt having become completely intoxicated with sense pleasures. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Blinded by sense pleasure, covered with a net,<br>
covered over with the covering of craving,<br>
Bound by <span class='add'>Māra</span> the heedless one’s kin, like fish in the mouth of a trap,<br>
They go to old age and death, like a suckling calf to its mother.”</p>
</blockquote>
