<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4943'>Walt 4943</a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything,<br>
Seclusion-Lover, the Sambuddha<br>
was flying through the sky <span class='add'>back then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4944'>Walt 4944</a> In the Himalayan region,<br>
there was a large natural lake.<br>
My palace was <span class='add'>located</span> there,<br>
bound up with <span class='add'>my</span> good karma. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4945'>Walt 4945</a> Having gone out from the palace,<br>
I saw the Leader of the World,<br>
bright like a blue water lily,<br>
blazing up like a fire-altar. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4946'>Walt 4946</a> <span class='add'>Thinking,</span> “I’ll worship the Leader,”<br>
<span class='add'>though</span> I searched I saw no flower.<br>
Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> own heart,<br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>him</span>, the Teacher, <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4947'>Walt 4947</a> With the gem <span class='add'>I had</span> on my head,<br>
I worshipped <span class='add'>him</span>, the World-Leader:<br>
“Let there be a lucky result<br>
of this offering of a gem.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4948'>Walt 4948</a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
the Teacher, standing in the sky,<br>
spoke this verse <span class='add'>about me then</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4949'>Walt 4949</a> “Let your thought have a good result;<br>
let you receive huge happiness.<br>
Because of offering this gem,<br>
let you experience great fame.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4950'>Walt 4950</a> Having said this, the Blessed One,<br>
the one whose name was “Best Lotus,”<br>
the Best Buddha <span class='add'>then</span> flew away,<br>
to where <span class='add'>his</span> mind directed <span class='add'>him</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4951'>Walt 4951</a> Sixty aeons the lord of gods,<br>
I exercised divine rule.<br>
And another hundred times I<br>
was a monarch who turns the wheel. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4952'>Walt 4952</a> When I had become a god who<br>
remembered <span class='add'>his</span> former karma,<br>
a gemstone comes to be for me,<br>
<span class='add'>which functioned as</span> my source of light. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4953-4954'>Walt 4953-4954</a> Eighty-six thousand women <span class='add'>then</span><br>
were <span class='add'>married to me as</span> my wives,<br>
with varied clothes and jewelry<br>
and wearing earrings made of gems,<br>
with long eyelashes, lovely smiles<br>
and slim waists, pleasant to look at.<br>
<span class='add'>They’re</span> constantly waiting on me:<br>
that’s the fruit of offering gems. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11-12'>Verse 11-12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4955'>Walt 4955</a> Well-made things to adorn <span class='add'>myself</span><br>
are <span class='add'>coming</span> to me as I wish,<br>
made of gold and made of gemstones,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> likewise made out of rubies. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4956'>Walt 4956</a> Delightful gabled huts and caves,<br>
and beds that are very costly,<br>
discerning what I am thinking,<br>
are produced according to wish. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4957'>Walt 4957</a> The gain for them is well-received<br>
who get to listen <span class='add'>to Buddha,</span><br>
the Merit-Field for humankind,<br>
the Medicine for all that breathe. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4958'>Walt 4958</a> My karma too was <span class='add'>so</span> well done,<br>
which is that I saw the Leader.<br>
I am freed from <span class='add'>all</span> suffering;<br>
<span class='add'>I’ve</span> attained the unshaking state. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4959'>Walt 4959</a> In whichever womb I’m reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
on all sides are the seven gems;<br>
there is light for me all the time. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4960'>Walt 4960</a> Because of that gem-offering,<br>
having enjoyed <span class='add'>great</span> good fortune,<br>
the knowledge-light is seen by me;<br>
I’ve attained the unshaking state. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4961'>Walt 4961</a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I offered that gem <span class='add'>to him</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of offering gems. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4962'>Walt 4962</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4963'>Walt 4963</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4964'>Walt 4964</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
