the people, with exalted minds,<br>
intoxicated with delight<br>
did <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i> for the Neutral One,<br>
the Teacher, who was the World’s Best,<br>
Blessed One, Padumuttara. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1' href='#vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>

was born, great joy arose in me.<br>
Gathering my family and friends<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to all of them</span>:<br>
“the Great Hero has passed away;<br>
surely we should do a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>!” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2' href='#vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw402' href='#jw402'>Walt 402</a> They agreed saying, “Excellent!”<br>
which made me smile even more.<br>
“We’ll make a meritorious pyre<br>
over the Buddha, the World-Chief.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3' href='#vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw403' href='#jw403'>Walt 403</a> We made a well-made festoon work<br>
which was one hundred hands in height,<br>
and we raised up into the sky<br>
a mansion fifty hands higher. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4' href='#vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw404' href='#jw404'>Walt 404</a> Having made that festoon work there,<br>
decorated with rows of stripes,<br>
bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> own mind<br>
I worshipped that excellent shrine. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5' href='#vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw405' href='#jw405'>Walt 405</a> Like a blazing column of fire,<br>
like a regal <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> tree in bloom,<br>
like Indra’s post up in the sky<br>
it shined in the four directions. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6' href='#vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw406'>Walt 406</a> After making <span class='add' href='#jw406'>Walt 406</a> After making <span class='add'>my</span> mind pleased there<br>
and doing much that was wholesome,<br>
recalling karma from the past<br>
I was born with the thirty <span class='add'>gods</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7' href='#vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw407' href='#jw407'>Walt 407</a> I possessed a divine chariot<br>
yoked with one thousand <span class='add'>fine</span> horses.<br>
That tall residence of mine <span class='add'>there</span><br>
was seven stories <span class='add'>tall</span> in height. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8' href='#vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw408' href='#jw408'>Walt 408</a> It had one thousand gabled cells;<br>
all <span class='add'>of them were</span> made out of gold.<br>
It blazed by means of its own power<br>
lighting up every direction. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9' href='#vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw409' href='#jw409'>Walt 409</a> There were also other doorways<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> made of rubies <span class='add'>at that time</span>.<br>
With their light they too illumined<br>
the four directions entirely. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10' href='#vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw410' href='#jw410'>Walt 410</a> Those well-constructed gabled cells<br>
produced by <span class='add'>my past</span> good karma<br>
and <span class='add'>all</span> the gemstone <span class='add'>doors</span> then shined<br>
in ten directions on all sides. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11' href='#vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw411'>Walt 411</a> When they were thus <span class='add' href='#jw411'>Walt 411</a> When they were thus <span class='add'>all</span> shining forth<br>
there was a massive effulgence.<br>
I surpassed all the <span class='add'>other</span> gods;<br>
that is the fruit of good karma. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12' href='#vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw412' href='#jw412'>Walt 412</a> Sixty thousand aeons ago<br>
I was the king named Ubbiddha.<br>
Victorious on <span class='add'>all</span> four sides<br>
I took the earth as residence. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13' href='#vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw413' href='#jw413'>Walt 413</a> In that most auspicious aeon<br>
for fully thirty times I was<br>
a wheel-turning king with great strength<br>
deriving from my own karma. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14' href='#vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>

I‘m lord of the four continents.<br>
And in that place my residence<br>
was as tall as the tree of Indra. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15' href='#vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw414-415'>Walt 414-415</a> It was twenty-four <span class='add' href='#jw414-415'>Walt 414-415</a> It was twenty-four <span class='add'>leagues</span> in length,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> in width <span class='add'>it measured</span> twelve <span class='add'>leagues</span>.<br>
<span class='add'>My</span> city was named Rammaka;<br>
it had strong ramparts and gateways. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16' href='#vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw415'>Walt 415</a> It was five hundred <span class='add' href='#jw415'>Walt 415</a> It was five hundred <span class='add'>leagues</span> in length,<br>
in width two hundred fifty <span class='add'>leagues</span>.<br>
It was crowded with groups of men<br>
just like the thirty-three gods’ city. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17' href='#vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw416' href='#jw416'>Walt 416</a> Like needles in a needle-case<br>
there were twenty <span class='add'>different</span> bazaars<br>
<span class='add'>where</span> they gather, one another;<br>
<span class='add'>the city</span> was <span class='add'>very</span> crowded. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18' href='#vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw417' href='#jw417'>Walt 417</a> Of such a sort was my city,<br>
with elephants, horses, chariots<br>
and <span class='add'>very</span> crowded with people:<br>
Rammaka, excellent city. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19' href='#vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw418' href='#jw418'>Walt 418</a> Having lived there and having left<br>
I returned to the world of gods.<br>
In this, my final existence,<br>
I’m born in an accomplished clan. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20' href='#vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw419' href='#jw419'>Walt 419</a> Born into a brahmin family<br>
I had a massive heap of gems.<br>
Eight hundred million <span class='add'>worth of</span> gold<br>
abandoned, I went forth renouncing. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21' href='#vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw420'>Walt 420</a> My defilements are <span class='add' href='#jw420'>Walt 420</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>

Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw421' href='#jw421'>Walt 421</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
