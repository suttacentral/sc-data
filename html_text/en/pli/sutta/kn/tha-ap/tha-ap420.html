<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4416'>Walt 4416</a> Taking someone unknown to me,<br>
I went to a village back then.<br>
Seeing a very full river,<br>
I approached a monastery. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4417'>Walt 4417</a> Forest-dwellers, punctilious,<br>
meditators, <span class='add'>clad in</span> coarse robes,<br>
wise, lovers of seclusion, were<br>
living in <span class='add'>that</span> monastery. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4418'>Walt 4418</a> Their destinies had been cut off,<br>
well-liberated, neutral ones;<br>
they did not go begging for alms<br>
if the river obstructed <span class='add'>them</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4419'>Walt 4419</a> Happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
awe-struck, with hands pressed together,<br>
taking <span class='add'>some</span> rice-grain that I had,<br>
I made a gruel-donation <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4420'>Walt 4420</a> Giving gruel <span class='add'>to those monks</span> five times,<br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span>pleased by <span class='add'>my</span> own hands,<br>
satisfied with <span class='add'>my</span> own karma,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa then. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4421'>Walt 4421</a> A mansion made of gems was born<br>
for me in the group of thirty.<br>
I joyed with a group of women<br>
in that superb mansion <span class='add'>of mine</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4422'>Walt 4422</a> Thirty-three times the lord of gods,<br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
Thirty times a wheel-turning king,<br>
I exercised overlordship. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4423'>Walt 4423</a> There was <span class='add'>also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
In the world of gods or humans,<br>
I <span class='add'>always</span> enjoyed <span class='add'>great</span> fame. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4424'>Walt 4424</a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
As soon as <span class='add'>my</span> hair was cut off,<br>
I realized complete success. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4425'>Walt 4425</a> Due to decay, due to old age,<br>
contemplating this corpse <span class='add'>of mine</span>,<br>
before the training rules were taught,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4426'>Walt 4426</a> Well-given was my superb gift;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> trade was very well-applied.<br>
Because of that very gruel-gift,<br>
I’ve attained the unshaking state. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4427'>Walt 4427</a> I have no experience of<br>
sorrow <span class='add'>and</span> wailing <span class='add'>and</span> illness,<br>
<span class='add'>nor</span> distress that torments the mind:<br>
that is the fruit of giving gruel. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4428'>Walt 4428</a> O! <span class='add'>that</span> gruel was very well spent!<br>
Giving the monks’ Assembly gruel,<br>
in the unsurpassed merit-field,<br>
I enjoy <span class='add'>these</span> five good results: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4429'>Walt 4429</a> I don’t get ill, I’m beautiful,<br>
the Teaching quickly is observed,<br>
I receive <span class='add'>lots of</span> food <span class='add'>and</span> drink,<br>
and <span class='add'>my long</span> lifespan is the fifth. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4430'>Walt 4430</a> Whoever struck by awe would give<br>
gruel to the Assembly of monks,<br>
that wise person would <span class='add'>also</span> get<br>
these five <span class='add'>most welcome</span> benefits. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p>What should be done has all been done;<br>
I have put an end to rebirths.<br>
All defilements are exhausted;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p>I am wandering from village<br>
to village, city to city,<br>
extolling <span class='add'>him</span>, the Sambuddha,<br>
and <span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> virtuous Teaching. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4431'>Walt 4431</a> In the thirty thousand aeons<br>
since I gave that gift at that time,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of giving gruel. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4432'>Walt 4432</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4433'>Walt 4433</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4434'>Walt 4434</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
