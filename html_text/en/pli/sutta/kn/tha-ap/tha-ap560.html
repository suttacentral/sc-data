<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6428'></a> I, having plunged into a pond,<br>
served by various elephants,<br>
am pulling up lotus root there,<br>
because <span class='add'>they’re what</span> I’m eating then.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6429-6430'></a> The Buddha in that period<br>
bore the name Padumuttara.<br>
Wearing cloth <span class='add'>dyed</span> red, the Buddha<br>
is traveling through the sky <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
shaking <span class='add'>his</span> robes made out of rags.<br>
Then I heard the sound <span class='add'>of his robes</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> looking upward <span class='add'>at the sky,</span><br>
I saw the Leader of the World.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6431'></a> Remaining in that very place,<br>
I invited the World-Leader:<br>
“Honey is flowing from the roots<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> milk <span class='add'>and</span> oil <span class='add'>flow</span> from the stems;<br>
let the Buddha, the Eyeful One,<br>
with pity accept <span class='add'>some</span> from me.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6432'></a> Then the Teacher, Compassionate,<br>
the Greatly Famed One, descended.<br>
The Eyeful One, with pity then,<br>
accepted <span class='add'>that</span> alms food of mine.<br>
Accepting <span class='add'>it</span>, the Sambuddha<br>
expressed <span class='add'>his</span> thanks to me <span class='add'>like this</span>:</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6433'></a> “Be happy, O merit-filled one;<br>
let your rebirth be accomplished.<br>
Due to this gift of lotus root,<br>
may you receive huge happiness.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6434'></a> Having said that, the Sambuddha,<br>
the one whose name was “Best Lotus,”<br>
the Sambuddha, taking <span class='add'>that</span> food,<br>
the Victor flew off through the sky.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6435'></a> Having taken <span class='add'>more</span> lotus root,<br>
I came <span class='add'>back</span> to my hermitage.<br>
Hanging that root up in a tree,<br>
I remembered my offering.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6436'></a> A massive wind<span class='add'>-storm</span> then arose;<br>
it agitated the forest.<br>
The space was filled up with the noise<br>
of thunderbolts bursting forth <span class='add'>there</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6437'></a> Then lightening falling <span class='add'>from the sky,</span><br>
struck <span class='add'>me right</span> on <span class='add'>top of</span> my head.<br>
<span class='add'>Because of that,</span> sitting down,<br>
I passed away <span class='add'>right</span> on the spot.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6438'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> bound up with my good karma,<br>
I was reborn in Tusitā.<br>
<span class='add'>When</span> my <span class='add'>human</span> body fell down,<br>
I delighted in the gods’ world.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6439'></a> Eighty-six thousand women <span class='add'>then,</span><br>
decked out <span class='add'>in fine clothes and jewelry,</span><br>
wait on me evening and morning:<br>
the fruit of giving lotus root.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6440'></a> Having come to a human womb,<br>
I am then happy all the time.<br>
I have no lack of possessions:<br>
the fruit of giving lotus root.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6441'></a> Having <span class='add'>then</span> been pitied by him,<br>
the God of Gods, the Neutral One,<br>
all defilements are exhausted;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6442'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave that alms food back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
the fruit of giving lotus root.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6443'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6444'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6445'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
