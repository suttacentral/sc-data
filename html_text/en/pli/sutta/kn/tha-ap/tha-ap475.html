<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4965'>Walt 4965</a> The Blessed One named Kosika,<br>
Meditator, Trance-Loving One,<br>
Buddha, Seclusion-Lover, Sage,<br>
lived on Cittakūṭa back then. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4966'>Walt 4966</a> Plunged into the Himalayas,<br>
attended by troops of women,<br>
I saw <span class='add'>him</span>, Kosika Buddha,<br>
like the moon on the fifteenth day. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4967'>Walt 4967</a> With a hundred flaming<span class='add'>-torches,</span><br>
I waited on <span class='add'>him</span> at that time.<br>
Remaining seven nights and days,<br>
on the eighth <span class='add'>day</span> I departed. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4968'>Walt 4968</a> With a pleased heart, having worshipped<br>
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,<br>
Kosika Buddha, <span class='add'>when</span> he rose,<br>
I <span class='add'>also</span> gave one meal <span class='add'>to him</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4969'>Walt 4969</a> Through that karma for the World’s Best,<br>
the Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men,<br>
I was reborn in Tusitā:<br>
that is the fruit of <span class='add'>that</span> one meal. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4970'>Walt 4970</a> During the day and also at<br>
night, there is always light for me;<br>
on all sides for a hundred leagues,<br>
I am permeated by light. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4971'>Walt 4971</a> In the fifty-fifth aeon hence<br>
I was a king who turns the wheel,<br>
lord of the grove of rose-apples,<br>
victorious on <span class='add'>all</span> four sides. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4972'>Walt 4972</a> My city at that time was rich,<br>
prosperous and well-constructed.<br>
<span class='add'>It measured</span> thirty leagues in length,<br>
and <span class='add'>it was</span> twenty leagues in width. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4973'>Walt 4973</a> <span class='add'>My</span> city was named Sobhana;<br>
<span class='add'>it</span> was built by Vissakamma.<br>
<span class='add'>It</span> did not lack for the ten sounds,<br>
well-accompanied by cymbals. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4974'>Walt 4974</a> No<span class='add'>thing</span> in that city was \[made<br>
of\] sticks <span class='add'>or of</span> vines <span class='add'>or of</span> clay.<br>
Everything was made out of gold,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> it was shining all the time. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4975'>Walt 4975</a> Four rampart walls surrounded <span class='add'>it</span>;<br>
they were constructed out of gems.<br>
In the middle, a palmyra<br>
pond was made by Vissakamma. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4976'>Walt 4976</a> <span class='add'>There were</span> ten thousand ponds <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
covered with pink and blue lotus,<br>
covered with white lotuses <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> exuding varied perfumes. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4977'>Walt 4977</a> In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I carried those torches <span class='add'>for him</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
the fruit of carrying torches. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4978'>Walt 4978</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4979'>Walt 4979</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4980'>Walt 4980</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
