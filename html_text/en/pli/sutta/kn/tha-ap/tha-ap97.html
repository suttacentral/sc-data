<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1576-78'></a>I made a perfumed stupa for<br>
<span class='add'>him</span>, Siddhattha, the Blessed One,<br>
the Buddha, Top Chief of the World,<br>
blazing up like a fire-altar,<br>
bright as a blue water lily,<br>
as superb as a tiger bull,<br>
of noble birth as is a lion,<br>
seated, the Top of <span class='add'>all</span> the Monks,<br>
Honored by the Monks’ Assembly,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> covered it with jasmine flowers<br>
appropriate for the Buddha.<br>
<span class='add'>Then</span> worshipping the Teacher’s feet<br>
I departed facing the north. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1-3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1579'></a>In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I gave that perfumed garland <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
distinguished by the fruit of doing<br>
what should be done for the Buddha,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1580'></a> In the thirty-ninth aeon <span class='add'>hence</span><br>
there were sixteen <span class='add'>different</span> people;<br>
<span class='add'>all</span> were known as Devagandha<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> they were <span class='add'>all</span> wheel-turning kings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1581'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Gandhamāliya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
