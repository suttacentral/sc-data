Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
known by the name of Kassapa,<br>
Best Debater, <span class='add'>Buddha,</span> arose. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6274'>Walt 6274</a> Then I, after having gone forth<br>
in the Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
wandering in the holy life<br>
as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived, fell from there. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6275'>Walt 6275</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6276-6277'>Walt 6276-6277</a> Fallen from there, in a forest,<br>
I was <span class='add'>then born as</span> a pigeon.<br>
A Buddhist monk <span class='add'>was</span> living there,<br>
always delighting in trances,<br>
loving-hearted, compassionate,<br>
with a face always greatly pleased,<br>
even-minded, a great hero,<br>
learned in the <span class='add'>four</span> boundless <span class='add'>states</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4-5'>Verse 4-5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6278'>Walt 6278</a> In not a long time I trusted<br>
that follower of the Buddha,<br>
whose thoughts were without obstructions,<br>
friendly toward all living beings. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6279'>Walt 6279</a> Then whenever <span class='add'>I</span> approached him,<br>
every day he preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
and gave <span class='add'>a little of his</span> food<br>
to me, seated before <span class='add'>his</span> feet. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6280'>Walt 6280</a> After living <span class='add'>like that</span> back then,<br>
with great love for the Victor’s son,<br>
having died I went to heaven,<br>
like home <span class='add'>after</span> being abroad. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6281'>Walt 6281</a> Fallen from heaven I’m reborn<br>
as human due to good karma.<br>
Throwing away <span class='add'>life in</span> the house,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> went forth repeatedly. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6282'>Walt 6282</a> As monk, ascetic <span class='add'>or</span> brahmin,<br>
I was thus one who had gone forth,<br>
becoming a forest-dweller<br>
<span class='add'>in</span> various hundreds <span class='add'>of lives</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6283'>Walt 6283</a> And now in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
a brahmin <span class='add'>named</span> Vacchagotta<br>
in lovely Kapilavastu,<br>
I set forth along with <span class='add'>my</span> wife. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6284'>Walt 6284</a> My mother’s pregnancy craving<br>
<span class='add'>when she was</span> close to giving birth,<br>
resolved <span class='add'>her</span> to live in the woods,<br>
when <span class='add'>I</span> had come out of <span class='add'>her</span> womb. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6285'>Walt 6285</a> <span class='add'>My</span> mother then gave birth to me<br>
within a beautiful forest.<br>
As I departed from her womb,<br>
they swaddled me in saffron <span class='add'>cloth</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6286'>Walt 6286</a> After that Prince Siddhartha was<br>
born, Banner of the Śākyan Clan.<br>
I became his beloved friend,<br>
held in confidence and honored. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6287'>Walt 6287</a> When Beings’ Hardwood departed,<br>
renouncing <span class='add'>all of his</span> vast fame,<br>
after having gone forth as well,<br>
I went to the Himalayas. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6288'>Walt 6288</a> Seeing respected Kassapa,<br>
preacher of rigor, in the woods,<br>
hearing the Victor’d arisen,<br>
I approached the Coachman of Men. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6289'>Walt 6289</a> He <span class='add'>then</span> preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to me,<br>
with all of the meanings explained.<br>
Then, going forth <span class='add'>under Buddha,</span><br>
I went to the forest again. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6290'>Walt 6290</a> Zealously living there I <span class='add'>then</span><br>
learned the six special knowledges.<br>
O! I have obtained a good gain,<br>
being pitied by <span class='add'>my</span> good friend. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6291'>Walt 6291</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6292'>Walt 6292</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6293'>Walt 6293</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
