<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5839'></a> One hundred thousand aeons hence<br>
the Leader arose <span class='add'>in the world</span>,<br>
the Great Light, Chief of the Three Worlds,<br>
who name was Padumuttara. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5840-5841'></a> My mind thrilled, having heard the Sage,<br>
praising the virtue of a monk<br>
who had instant comprehension;<br>
doing a deed for the Great Sage,<br>
having given alms for a week<br>
to the Sage with <span class='add'>his</span> students, I<br>
saluting <span class='add'>him</span>, the Sambuddha,<br>
then aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2-3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5842-5845'></a> The Buddha prophesied <span class='add'>of</span> me:<br>
“All of you look at this brahmin,<br>
fallen down in front of my feet,<br>
broad-shouldered, contemplating <span class='add'>me</span>,<br>
gold brahmin’s cord on <span class='add'>his</span> torso,<br>
skin that’s white upon his body,<br>
who has pouty, copper-red lips,<br>
teeth that are white, sharp and even,<br>
with the utmost strength of virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> body hair growing upward,<br>
with senses flooded by virtue,<br>
with a face blossoming in joy,<br>
wishing for the place of the monk<br>
who has instant comprehension.<br>
In the future, a Great Hero<br>
will come to be, named Gotama. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4-7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5846'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Bāhiya<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5847'></a> Then very happy, being roused,<br>
for as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived, doing<br>
deeds for the Sage, fallen, I went<br>
to heaven, as though my own home. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5848'></a> Born as a god or as a man,<br>
because of the power of that<br>
karma, transmigrating I <span class='add'>then</span><br>
enjoyed good fortune <span class='add'>everywhere</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5849'></a> Again, when Hero Kassapa’s<br>
dispensation had reached <span class='add'>its</span> goal,<br>
ascending to a mountain-top,<br>
engaged in the Victor’s teachings, <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5850'></a> of pure morals, wise, doers<br>
of the Victor’s dispensation,<br>
fallen from there, <span class='add'>we</span> five people,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> went to the world of the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5851'></a> Then I was born as Bāhiya,<br>
in Bhārukaccha, best city.<br>
From there by boat I venture forth<br>
on the ocean full of danger. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5852'></a> After going for a few days<br>
from there, the boat was broken up;<br>
then I fell into <span class='add'>the ocean</span>,<br>
awful, fearful, sea-monster-mine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5853'></a> At that time, after <span class='add'>much</span> struggling,<br>
having crossed over the ocean,<br>
disoriented, I arrived<br>
at the good seaport Suppāra. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5854-5855'></a> Having dressed in robes made of bark,<br>
I entered the village for alms.<br>
Then a man <span class='add'>there</span>, delighted, said,<br>
“This is an arahant who’s come;<br>
honoring him with food <span class='add'>and</span> drink,<br>
with clothes and <span class='add'>also</span> with a bed,<br>
and <span class='add'>furthermore</span> with medicine,<br>
we’ll be happy <span class='add'>through that karma</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw16-17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5856'></a> Receiving <span class='add'>that</span>, then going back,<br>
<span class='add'>thus</span> honored and worshipped by them,<br>
wrongly I gave rise to the thought<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> “this one is an arahant.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5857'></a> Afterward, discerning my mind,<br>
the non-returner god reproached:<br>
“You don’t know the path, the method;<br>
how could you be an arahant?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5858'></a> Reproached by him I was then moved;<br>
I questioned him back <span class='add'>in this way</span>:<br>
“Who, or where in the world are they,<br>
<span class='add'>those</span> supreme men, the arahants?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5859'></a> “Of Vast Wisdom, Greatly Very Wise, the<br>
Victor, in Śrāvasti, in Kosala’s palace,<br>
the Śākyas’ Son, the Arahant, Undefiled One<br>
is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> for reaching arahantship.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw21-22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5860'></a> Then having heard <span class='add'>that</span> word of him <span class='add'>I was</span> well-gladdened,<br>
very astonished like a pauper finding treasure,<br>
mind thrilled <span class='add'>for</span> ultimate arahantship, <span class='add'>and</span> to<br>
know the Good-Looking One, the Limitless Pasture. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23-24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5861'></a> Delighting at that time, departing for the Teacher,<br>
always I see the Victor whose Face is Stainless.<br>
Approaching the delightful grove named Vijita,<br>
I questioned brahmins, “Where is the World’s Delighter?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw25-26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5862'></a> Then they replied, “the One Worshipped by Men <span class='add'>and</span> Gods<br>
has entered the city wishing to eat some food;<br>
very quickly indeed, zealous to see the Sage,<br>
approach and worship him, the Foremost of People. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27-28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5863-5864'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> then, having gone speedily<br>
to Śrāvasti, the best city,<br>
I saw the <span class='add'>Buddha</span> wandering<br>
for alms, without greed or desire,<br>
bowl in hand, eyes undistracted,<br>
as though dividing ambrosia,<br>
like the abode of good fortune,<br>
face bearing the blaze of the sun. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29-30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5865'></a> Coming together, bowing down,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> spoke these words to him <span class='add'>there</span>:<br>
“O Gotama, be the refuge<br>
for one who’s lost on the wrong road.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5866'></a> The Seventh Sage said this <span class='add'>to me</span>:<br>
“I’m wandering on <span class='add'>my</span> alms-round<br>
to help living beings cross; not<br>
the time to tell you the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5867'></a> Again <span class='add'>and</span> again I asked the<br>
Buddha, being greedy for <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.<br>
He then preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to me,<br>
the state that is deep and empty. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5868'></a> Hearing his Teaching, I attained<br>
the destruction of the outflows,<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> lifespan obliterated.<br>
O! the Teacher’s mercifulness! <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5869'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5870'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5871'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5872'></a> Thus prophesied the elder <span class='add'>named</span><br>
Bāhiya Dārucīriya.<br>
He fell down on a garbage heap<br>
when he had been gored by a cow. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5873'></a> Having detailed his own former<br>
conduct, he who was very wise,<br>
that hero fully passed away<br>
in Śrāvasti, supreme city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5874-5875'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> departing from the city,<br>
the Seventh Sage, having seen him—<br>
the wise one who wore robes of wood,<br>
outsider come to the outside,<br>
now fallen onto the safe ground,<br>
like the fallen flag of Indra,<br>
lifespan gone, defilements gone, a<br>
doer of the Victor’s teachings—<a class='vjw' id='vjw40-41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5876'></a> the Teacher said to followers<br>
who delighted in the teachings:<br>
“get, and having taken <span class='add'>it</span> burn,<br>
the body of your fellow monk. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5877'></a> Build a stupa <span class='add'>and</span> worship it;<br>
this great wise one reached nirvana,<br>
foremost in instant comprehension,<br>
follower who heeded my words. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5878'></a> One word in a verse, hearing which,<br>
one becomes calm, is better than<br>
even a thousand verses, if<br>
they possess words without meaning. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5879'></a> Where the waters and the earth, the<br>
fire and the wind have no footing,<br>
there the stars are not shining, <span class='add'>and</span><br>
the sun <span class='add'>remains</span> invisible;<br>
the moon does not shed light there, <span class='add'>and</span><br>
darkness is not to be found there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45,.46a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5880'></a> And when one knows <span class='add'>that place</span> oneself,<br>
a sage, a brahmin with wisdom,<br>
he’s freed from form and formlessness,<br>
from happiness and suffering.”<br>
Thus <span class='add'>he</span> spoke, <span class='add'>the Buddha</span>, the Lord,<br>
the Sage, Refuge of the Three Worlds. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46c-d,.47'></a></p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Bāhiya Thera spoke these verses.</p>
