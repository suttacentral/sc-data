<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2984'></a> In deep forest which was crowded<br>
with wild beasts there was a stupa<br>
of Blessed Padumuttara,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2985'></a> Nobody dared to travel <span class='add'>there</span><br>
to pay homage to the stupa.<br>
The stupa was broken, <span class='add'>in ruins</span>,<br>
covered in grasses, sticks and vines. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2986'></a> I was then a forest-worker,<br>
as were father and grandfathers.<br>
I saw that stupa in the woods,<br>
broken, tangled in grass and vines. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2987-2988'></a>Having seen the Buddha’s stupa,<br>
I served <span class='add'>it</span> with a reverent heart:<br>
“the Best Buddha’s stupa, broken,<br>
is abandoned in the forest.<br>
It’s not meet, not appropriate<br>
for one who can tell right from wrong.<br>
<span class='add'>But</span> I engage in other work,<br>
not cleaning the Buddha’s stupa.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4-5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2989'></a> Cleaning off the grasses and sticks<br>
and vines <span class='add'>growing</span> on the stupa,<br>
after worshipping <span class='add'>it</span> eight times,<br>
<span class='add'>still</span> bent over I <span class='add'>then</span> went off. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2990'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2991'></a> There my well-constructed mansion<br>
was <span class='add'>made of</span> gold, brightly shining.<br>
It rose up sixty leagues <span class='add'>in height</span><br>
<span class='add'>and it</span> was thirty leagues in width. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2992'></a> And thirty <span class='add'>different</span> times did I<br>
exercise rule over the gods.<br>
And five and twenty times was I<br>
a wheel-turning king <span class='add'>with great strength</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2993'></a> Transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I’m receiving great possessions.<br>
Possessions never lack for me:<br>
that’s the fruit of cleaning <span class='add'>stupas</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2994'></a> When I’m going in the forest,<br>
seated on an elephant’s back,<br>
whichever direction I go,<br>
the forest provides <span class='add'>me</span> refuge. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2995'></a> I do not see with <span class='add'>my two</span> eyes<br>
<span class='add'>any tree-</span>stump or thorn at all.<br>
In accordance with <span class='add'>my</span> karma,<br>
it gets removed all by itself. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2996'></a> I do not get the itch, ringworm,<br>
rashes, abscesses, leprosy,<br>
epilepsy <span class='add'>and</span> scabies <span class='add'>too</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of cleaning <span class='add'>stupas</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2997'></a> Another miracle for me:<br>
after I had cleaned the stupa,<br>
I was not conscious of pimples<br>
or spots produced on my body. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2998'></a> Another miracle for me:<br>
after I had cleaned the stupa,<br>
I transmigrate in <span class='add'>just</span> two states:<br>
that of a god, or of a man. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2999'></a> Another miracle for me:<br>
after I had cleaned the stupa,<br>
every place where I am living<br>
is gold-colored and very bright. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3000'></a> Another miracle for me:<br>
after I had cleaned the stupa,<br>
displeasing things are avoided,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> things which are pleasing appear. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3001'></a> Another miracle for me:<br>
after I had cleaned the stupa,<br>
my mind is <span class='add'>always very</span> pure,<br>
one-pointed, very attentive. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3002'></a> Another miracle for me:<br>
after I had cleaned the stupa,<br>
seated in a single sitting,<br>
I achieved the arahant-state. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3003'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I did that <span class='add'>good</span> karma then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of cleaning <span class='add'>stupas</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3004'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
