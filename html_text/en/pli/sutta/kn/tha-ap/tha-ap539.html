<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5881'>Walt 5881</a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the Sage, Knower of Every World,<br>
the One who had <span class='add'>Five</span> Eyes, arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5882'>Walt 5882</a>The Admonisher, Instructor,<br>
Crosser-Over of all that breathe,<br>
Skilled at Preaching, <span class='add'>he</span>, the Buddha,<br>
caused many folks to cross <span class='add'>the flood</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5883'>Walt 5883</a> Merciful, Compassionate One,<br>
Well-Wisher of all that breathe, he<br>
established in the five precepts<br>
all the rivals who had arrived. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5884'>Walt 5884</a> In this way he was Unconfused<br>
and Very Well-Known by rivals,<br>
Ornamented by arahants<br>
who were masters <span class='add'>and</span> neutral ones. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5885'>Walt 5885</a> The <span class='add'>body of the</span> Sage So Great<br>
rose up fifty-eight cubits <span class='add'>tall</span>;<br>
he was Valuable Like Gold,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5886'>Walt 5886</a> <span class='add'>People’s</span> lifespan at that time was<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
Remaining <span class='add'>in the world</span> so long,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5887'>Walt 5887</a> I then <span class='add'>lived</span> in Haṃsavatī,<br>
brahmin master of the Vedas.<br>
Approaching Beings’ Best Hardwood,<br>
I heard the preaching of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5888-5889'>Walt 5888-5889</a> Then <span class='add'>Buddha</span> placed a follower,<br>
who pastured in developed thought,<br>
skilled in meaning and the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
a hero, in that foremost place.<br>
After hearing that, I was thrilled;<br>
then for a week I fed <span class='add'>him</span>, the<br>
Best Victor, with <span class='add'>his</span> followers. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8-9'>Verse 8-9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5890'>Walt 5890</a> Having covered with <span class='add'>new</span> cloth <span class='add'>robes</span><br>
the Wisdom-Sea with <span class='add'>his</span> students,<br>
bowing down in front of <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5891'>Walt 5891</a> Afterward the World-Chief said <span class='add'>this</span>:<br>
“Look at that excellent brahmin,<br>
<span class='add'>now</span> bent down in front of my feet,<br>
with lotus-belly radiance. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5892-5893'>Walt 5892-5893</a> This one’s aspiring to the place<br>
of the monk of the Best Buddha.<br>
Through that faith, generosity,<br>
and <span class='add'>his</span> hearing of the Teaching,<br>
he’ll transmigrate from birth to birth,<br>
being happy in every place;<br>
very far into the future,<br>
he’ll receive that delightful <span class='add'>place</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12-13'>Verse 12-13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5894'>Walt 5894</a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5895'>Walt 5895</a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Koṭṭhita<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5896'>Walt 5896</a> After hearing that I was thrilled,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then for as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived,<br>
mindful, loving-hearted <span class='add'>and</span> wise,<br>
I waited on <span class='add'>him</span>, the Victor. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5897'>Walt 5897</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5898'>Walt 5898</a> Three hundred times <span class='add'>the lord of gods,</span><br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
and <span class='add'>then</span> five hundred times I was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5899'>Walt 5899</a> <span class='add'>There was also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
Through the power of that karma,<br>
I was happy in every place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5900'>Walt 5900</a> I transmigrate in <span class='add'>just</span> two states:<br>
that of a god, or of a man.<br>
I don’t go to other rebirths:<br>
that’s the fruit of good practice. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5901'>Walt 5901</a> I am born in the two <span class='add'>high</span> clans,<br>
kṣatriyan and also brahmin.<br>
I don’t get born in lesser clans:<br>
that’s the fruit of good practice. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5902'>Walt 5902</a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained<br>
I was a kinsman of Brahmā,<br>
reborn <span class='add'>then</span> in a brahmin clan<br>
in Śrāvasti, very wealthy. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5903-5904'>Walt 5903-5904</a> Mother was named Candavatī;<br>
my father Assalāyana.<br>
When with all intelligence the<br>
Buddha instructed my father,<br>
being pleased with the Well-Gone-One,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
Moggallāna was my teacher;<br>
Sāri’s child was my preceptor. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23-24'>Verse 23-24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5905'>Walt 5905</a> When my hair was being cut off,<br>
views were cut off <span class='add'>too</span>, with their roots.<br>
<span class='add'>While</span> living in the saffron robes,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5906'>Walt 5906</a> Because my thought was developed<br>
<span class='add'>well</span> in meaning and the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
the World-Chief placed me in that place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5907'>Walt 5907</a> Questioned by Upatissa, I<br>
explained with no<span class='add'>thing</span> indistinct.<br>
Thus in analytical modes,<br>
I’m foremost in the religion. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5908'>Walt 5908</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28'>Verse 28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5909'>Walt 5909</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5910'>Walt 5910</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30'>Verse 30</a></p>
