<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5689'>Walt 5689</a> One hundred thousand aeons hence<br>
a Leader arose <span class='add'>in the world</span>,<br>
Superior-Named, Boundless One,<br>
whose name was Padumuttara. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5690'>Walt 5690</a> <span class='add'>His</span> speech had lotus-attributes,<br>
skin was stainless like a lotus;<br>
<span class='add'>Buddha was</span> Unsoiled by the World,<br>
like a pink lotus by water. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5691'>Walt 5691</a> Wise One, with eyes like lotus leaves,<br>
Beloved as is a lotus,<br>
he had a superb lotus scent;<br>
therefore his <span class='add'>name was</span> “Best Lotus.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5692'>Walt 5692</a> The World’s Best One, Free of Conceit,<br>
proverbial Eyes for the Blind,<br>
Virtue-Treasure, the Mask of Peace,<br>
Ocean of Compassionate Thoughts, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5693'>Walt 5693</a> Praised by Brahmā, titans <span class='add'>and</span> gods,<br>
the Great Hero, the Best Person,<br>
Crowded by Men Along with Gods,<br>
once, dwelling among people, he <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5694'>Walt 5694</a> delighted the whole multitude<br>
with <span class='add'>his</span> very fragrant speaking<br>
and <span class='add'>with his</span> voice, <span class='add'>sweet as</span> honey,<br>
<span class='add'>while</span> praising <span class='add'>his</span> own follower: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5695'>Walt 5695</a> “Intent on faith, with a good mind,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> greedy for my appearance,<br>
there’s no other as <span class='add'>much</span> like that<br>
as is this monk <span class='add'>named</span> Vakkali.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5696'>Walt 5696</a> Back then I was a brahmin’s son,<br>
in the city, Haṃsavatī.<br>
After hearing <span class='add'>the Buddha’s</span> speech,<br>
I longed <span class='add'>to have</span> that place <span class='add'>myself</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5697'>Walt 5697</a> Inviting the Stainless One, the<br>
Thus-Gone-One, with <span class='add'>his</span> followers,<br>
after feeding <span class='add'>them</span> for a week,<br>
I covered <span class='add'>them</span> with <span class='add'>new</span> cloth <span class='add'>robes</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5698'>Walt 5698</a> Bowing <span class='add'>my</span> head to the <span class='add'>Buddha</span>,<br>
sunk in <span class='add'>his</span> limitless ocean<br>
of virtue, overflowing with joy,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him just then</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5699'>Walt 5699</a> “O <span class='add'>Great</span> Sage, seven days ago,<br>
you praised the one who is foremost<br>
among the monks possessing faith;<br>
I’ll <span class='add'>someday</span> be the same as <span class='add'>him</span>.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5700'>Walt 5700</a> When that was said, the Great Hero,<br>
whose Vision is Unobstructed,<br>
the Sage So Great uttered this speech<br>
to the <span class='add'>assembled</span> multitude: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5701'>Walt 5701</a> “All of you, look at this young man,<br>
clothed in polished gold<span class='add'>-colored clothes</span>,<br>
gold brahmin’s cord on <span class='add'>his</span> torso,<br>
transporting people’s eyes <span class='add'>and</span> minds. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5702'>Walt 5702</a> Very far into the future,<br>
this one will be the follower<br>
of Gotama <span class='add'>Buddha</span>, Great Sage,<br>
foremost of those intent on faith. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5703'>Walt 5703</a> <span class='add'>Whether</span> born human or divine,<br>
avoiding every torment <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
furnished with every possession,<br>
he will transmigrate happily. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5704'>Walt 5704</a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5705'>Walt 5705</a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Vakkali<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5706'>Walt 5706</a> Due to that karma’s excellence,<br>
and <span class='add'>my</span> intention and resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5707'>Walt 5707</a> Transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
being happy in every place,<br>
I was born in a certain clan,<br>
in the city of Śrāvasti. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5708-5709'>Walt 5708-5709</a> At the feet of the Great Sage,<br>
<span class='add'>my parents</span>, frightened by goblin-fears,<br>
wretched-minded laid me down <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
sleeping stretched out flat <span class='add'>on my back</span>,<br>
as tender as fresh butter is,<br>
soft like a <span class='add'>new-</span>born lotus sprout.<br>
“O Lord, we’re giving you this <span class='add'>boy</span>;<br>
please support him, O <span class='add'>World-</span>Leader.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20-21'>Verse 20-21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5710'>Walt 5710</a> Refuge for those who are frightened,<br>
the <span class='add'>Great</span> Sage then accepted me<br>
with his hand, soft as a lotus,<br>
which was webbed and marked with conch shells. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5711'>Walt 5711</a> Since that time I was <span class='add'>then</span> guarded<br>
by him who’s Guarded by No One;<br>
freed from all grounds for rebirth, I<br>
<span class='add'>am</span> reared up with <span class='add'>great</span> happiness. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5712'>Walt 5712</a> <span class='add'>Each</span> moment I’m deprived of <span class='add'>him</span>,<br>
the Well-Gone-One, I long <span class='add'>for him</span>;<br>
<span class='add'>being only</span> seven years old,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5713'>Walt 5713</a> Dissatisfied, I’m longing for<br>
his form possessing all good <span class='add'>traits</span>,<br>
produced by all the perfections,<br>
the highest home of good fortune. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5714'>Walt 5714</a> Knowing my love for Buddha’s form,<br>
the Victor then admonished me:<br>
“Enough, Vakkali! Why delight<br>
in form, rejoiced over by fools? <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5715'>Walt 5715</a> The one who sees the great Teaching,<br>
that man who’s wise is seeing me;<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> not seeing the great Teaching,<br>
he also is not seeing me. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5716'>Walt 5716</a> Endless danger is the body,<br>
likened to a poisonous tree;<br>
the abode of every disease,<br>
it’s just a heap of suffering. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28'>Verse 28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5717'>Walt 5717</a> Tiring of form, seeing <span class='add'>it as</span><br>
the rising and falling of parts,<br>
happily, one is going to reach<br>
the end of all the defilements.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5718'>Walt 5718</a> Being thus instructed by him,<br>
by the Leader, the Friendly Sage,<br>
having ascended Vulture’s Peak,<br>
I meditated in a cave. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30'>Verse 30</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5719-5720'>Walt 5719-5720</a> The Great Sage, standing at the foot<br>
of the mountain, <span class='add'>then</span> said to me,<br>
“O Vakkali,” <span class='add'>and</span> being thrilled,<br>
hearing the word of the Victor,<br>
I leapt right off that mountainside,<br>
varied hundreds of man-lengths <span class='add'>high</span>,<br>
then through the Buddha’s majesty,<br>
I reached the ground, comfortably. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw31-32'>Verse 31-32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5721'>Walt 5721</a> Once again he preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
the rising and falling of parts;<br>
<span class='add'>and this time,</span> grasping the Teaching,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33'>Verse 33</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5722'>Walt 5722</a> Then amidst a great multitude,<br>
the One Gone to the End of Death,<br>
Great-Minded One, appointed me<br>
foremost of those intent on faith. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw34'>Verse 34</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5723'>Walt 5723</a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I did that <span class='add'>good</span> karma then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw35'>Verse 35</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5724'>Walt 5724</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw36'>Verse 36</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5725'>Walt 5725</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw37'>Verse 37</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5726'>Walt 5726</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw38'>Verse 38</a></p>
