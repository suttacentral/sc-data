the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,<br>
shining like a dinner-plate tree,<br>

<span class='add'>him</span> beat the drum of the Teaching,<br>
sounding the roar of a lion,<br>
crushing groups of ford-worshippers? <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>

since I praised the Buddha <span class='add'>like that</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that is the fruit of praising <span class='add'>him</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4919'>Walt 4919</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4920'>Walt 4920</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>

six special knowledges mastered,<br>
