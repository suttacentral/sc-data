<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4113'></a> In Ketumati, best city,<br>
there was a king named Vijaya,<br>
a hero, endowed with great strength,<br>
inhabiting <span class='add'>that</span> city then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4114'></a> Because of that king’s indolence,<br>
wild men of the forest rose up.<br>
They were spies, and men with foul mouths;<br>
they laid waste to the country then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4115'></a> When the borderlands angered <span class='add'>him</span>,<br>
the king then quickly assembled<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> dependents and officers,<br>
to restrain <span class='add'>all those</span> enemies. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4116'></a> Elephant-riders, sentinels,<br>
champions, shield-bearing soldiers,<br>
archers and mighty noblemen:<br>
they all assembled at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4117'></a> The cooks <span class='add'>and</span> those who dress the hair,<br>
the bath boys, the garland-makers,<br>
heroes <span class='add'>and</span> conquering soldiers:<br>
they all assembled at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4118'></a> The swordsmen as well as the waiters,<br>
bowmen and people in armor,<br>
hunters and conquering soldiers:<br>
they all assembled at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4119'></a> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Mātaṅgas</i> rutting in three ways<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> tuskers sixty years of age,<br>
adorned with headdresses of gold:<br>
they all assembled at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4120'></a> The soldiers who have done the job,<br>
enduring cold <span class='add'>as well as</span> heat,<br>
also excrement-removal:<br>
they all assembled at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4121'></a> The sound of conchs, the sound of drums,<br>
and thus the sound of trumpets;<br>
they being gladded by those <span class='add'>sounds</span><br>
did all assemble at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4122'></a> Those who crush and those who injure<br>
with tridents <span class='add'>and</span> knives <span class='add'>and</span> mantras,<br>
suits of armor, also lances:<br>
they all assembled at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4123'></a> Dressing in a suit of armor<br>
that king, victory-less victor,<br>
impaled on tridents at that time<br>
sixty thousand living beings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4124'></a> The people then let out the cry,<br>
“Alas! the king is unrighteous.<br>
When will there <span class='add'>ever</span> be an end<br>
for one who is roasting in hell?” <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4125'></a> On the bed I then tossed and turned,<br>
<span class='add'>as though</span> I’m lying down in hell:<br>
I do not sleep by day and night;<br>
they torture me with a trident. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4126'></a> “What good is <span class='add'>this</span> careless kingship,<br>
<span class='add'>these</span> vehicles <span class='add'>or this</span> army?<br>
They aren’t able to support <span class='add'>me</span>;<br>
they terrify me all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4127'></a> What good are <span class='add'>these</span> sons <span class='add'>and these</span> wives,<br>
<span class='add'>as well as this</span> entire kingship?<br>
Well then why don’t I <span class='add'>now</span> go forth?<br>
I will cleanse the road to rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4128-4129'></a> Disregarding <span class='add'>all my</span> wealth <span class='add'>and</span><br>
fighting battles I abandoned<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> sixty thousand elephants<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>mātaṅgas</i> with gold headdresses,<br>
clothed in harnessing made of gold,<br>
mounted by elephant-trainers<br>
with lances and goads in <span class='add'>their</span> hands.<br>
Frightened by <span class='add'>my</span> own <span class='add'>bad</span> karma,<br>
I went out into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16-18a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4130-4131'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> sixty thousand horses <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
thoroughbreds of good pedigree,<br>
horses from Sindh, fast vehicles,<br>
mounted by trainers of horses<br>
wearing armor with bows in hand—<br>
having abandoned all of them,<br>
I went out into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18c-d-20a-b'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4132'></a> Sixty thousand chariots <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
covered in the skins of leopards<br>
and likewise tigers, flags hoisted—<br>
having abandoned all of them,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20c-d-21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4133'></a> Sixty thousand milch-cows <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> all the metal pails for milk—<br>
eliminating even them,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4134-4135'></a> <span class='add'>My</span> sixty thousand women <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
with varied clothes and jewelry<br>
and wearing earrings made of gems,<br>
with long eyelashes, lovely smiles<br>
and slim waists, pleasant to look at—<br>
abandoning them as they wept,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23-24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4136'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> sixty thousand villages,<br>
completely full in all regards—<br>
throwing away that <span class='add'>whole</span> kingship,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4137'></a> Having gone out from the city,<br>
I approached the Himalayas.<br>
On Bhāgīrathī River’s banks,<br>
I constructed a hermitage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4138'></a> Having built a hall out of leaves<br>
I made <span class='add'>myself</span> a heated room;<br>
bent on exertion, resolute,<br>
I’m living in my hermitage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4139'></a> Terror does not arise in me;<br>
I don’t see frights or fearful <span class='add'>things</span><br>
when meditating under trees,<br>
in pavilions or empty homes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4140'></a> The Sambuddha named Sumedha,<br>
Chief, Compassionate One, the Sage,<br>
blazing with the light of knowledge,<br>
arose in the world at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4141'></a> There was a powerful spirit<br>
living near my hermitage <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
When the Best Buddha came to be,<br>
he then announced <span class='add'>that fact</span> to me: <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4142'></a> “A Buddha’s risen in the world,<br>
an Eyeful One named Sumedha;<br>
he’s <span class='add'>helping</span> all the folk to cross;<br>
he will ferry you across too.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4143'></a> After hearing the spirit’s words,<br>
all the time I was deeply moved;<br>
thinking, “A Buddha! A Buddha!”<br>
I made my hermitage ready. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4144'></a> After chopping wood for the fire<br>
and smoothing out <span class='add'>my</span> sleeping mat,<br>
having worshipped my hermitage,<br>
I went out from the forest <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4145'></a> Taking sandalwood from village<br>
to village, city to city,<br>
searching for <span class='add'>him</span>, the God of Gods,<br>
I then came up to <span class='add'>him</span>, the Guide. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4146'></a> At that moment, the Blessed One,<br>
Sumedha, Leader of the World,<br>
was preaching the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths,<br>
enlightening the people then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4147'></a> Pressing both my hands together<br>
with the sandalwood on my head,<br>
having greeted the Sambuddha,<br>
I spoke these verses <span class='add'>to him then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4148'></a> “When jasmine trees are flowering<br>
<span class='add'>their</span> scents are diffused around them;<br>
Hero, with the scent of virtue you<br>
permeate every direction. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4149'></a> When the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> trees are flowering,<br>
champak, ironwood, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>vanika</i>,<br>
hiptage vines, and and <span class='add'>also</span> screw-pine,<br>
<span class='add'>their scents</span> get diffused with the wind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4150'></a> Having smelled your <span class='add'>perfume-like</span> scent,<br>
I came here from Himalaya.<br>
I worship you, O Sage So Great,<br>
World’s Best One, O One of Great Fame.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4151'></a> I anointed the World-Leader,<br>
Sumedha, with good sandalwood.<br>
Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> own heart<br>
I stood silently at that time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4152'></a> The Blessed One named Sumedha,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4153'></a> “This one who praised my virtues and<br>
who worshipped me with sandalwood,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4154'></a> For twenty-five aeons he is<br>
going to be a handsome man<br>
who speaks welcome words, pious<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> upright, full of great power. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4155'></a> In the twenty-sixth aeon he<br>
will delight in the world of gods.<br>
A thousand times he’ll be a king,<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4156'></a> Thirty-three times the lord of gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule,<br>
<span class='add'>and there will be</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4157'></a> Being fallen from there, this man<br>
will go on to the human state.<br>
Bound up with <span class='add'>his</span> good karma he’s<br>
going to be Brahma’s kinsman. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4158'></a> Learned, knowing <span class='add'>all</span> the mantras,<br>
a master of the three Vedas,<br>
endowed with three auspicious marks<br>
<span class='add'>will be</span> the brahmin, Bāvarī. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4159-4160'></a> Having become that man’s student,<br>
he’ll be a master of mantras.<br>
Going up to the Sambuddha,<br>
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,<br>
having asked <span class='add'>him</span> subtle questions,<br>
cultivating the straight <span class='add'>path, he</span><br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
will reach nirvana, undefiled.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw48-49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4161'></a> The three fires are blown out in me;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed;<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> living, undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4162'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4163'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4164'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
