<p><a class='jw' id='jw865'></a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
Who Had Crossed Over Everything,<br>
the Sambuddha went fully out<br>
like a fire finished burning. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw866'></a> Many people came together<br>
venerating the Thus-Gone-One.<br>
They made a well-made pyre <span class='add'>for him</span><br>
<span class='add'>then</span> lifted <span class='add'>his</span> body <span class='add'>on it</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw867'></a> Doing the needful with the corpse<br>
they gathered <span class='add'>all</span> the relics there.<br>
<span class='add'>Then</span> all the people, with <span class='add'>their</span> kings,<br>
constructed the Buddha’s stupa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw868'></a> The first <span class='add'>casket</span> was made of gold,<br>
the second was made of gemstone.<br>
The third was made out of silver,<br>
the fourth was made of crystal. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw869'></a> The fifth <span class='add'>stupa</span> which was built there<br>
was made of rubies fixed in glass.<br>
The sixth was made of all the gems<br>
with a <span class='add'>large</span> cat’s-eye on the top. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw870'></a> There was a railing made of gold;<br>
<span class='add'>its</span> legs were made out of gemstones.<br>
That stupa, all <span class='add'>encased</span> in gold,<br>
<span class='add'>rose up</span> in height a <span class='add'>full</span> league tall. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw871'></a> The gods then got together there<br>
and counseled one another <span class='add'>thus</span>:<br>
“we shall construct a stupa too<br>
for the World-Chief, the Neutral One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw872'></a> <span class='add'>But</span> there are no single relics;<br>
the body is in one lump <span class='add'>now</span>.<br>
We’ll enlarge this very stupa<br>
of the Buddha, using <span class='add'>fine</span> gold.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw873'></a> The gods, using the seven gems,<br>
raised it another league <span class='add'>taller</span>.<br>
That stupa, which was two leagues tall,<br>
dispelled the darkness <span class='add'>with its shine</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw874'></a> The snake-gods then assembled there<br>
and counseled one another <span class='add'>thus</span>:<br>
“The people and also the gods<br>
constructed the Buddha’s stupa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw875'></a> Do not let us be negligent;<br>
heedful, <span class='add'>and</span> with the lesser gods,<br>
we too shall enlarge <span class='add'>this</span> stupa<br>
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw876'></a> Gathering themselves together<br>
they covered the Buddha’s stupa<br>
with the two types of blue sapphire<br>
and with the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jotirasa</i> gem. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw877'></a> At that point Buddha’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>cetiya</i><br>
was made entirely of gems.<br>
In height it welled up three leagues <span class='add'>tall</span><br>
lighting up <span class='add'>the whole universe</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw878'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>garuḷas</i> got together<br>
and counseled one another <span class='add'>thus</span>:<br>
“The men and gods and snake-gods too<br>
constructed the Buddha’s stupa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw879'></a> Do not let us be negligent;<br>
heedful, <span class='add'>and</span> with the lesser gods,<br>
we too shall enlarge <span class='add'>this</span> stupa<br>
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw880'></a> That stupa made only of gems<br>
they gilded on the top <span class='add'>right then</span>.<br>
They too increased by one <span class='add'>whole</span> league<br>
the height of the Buddha’s stupa. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw881'></a> Then rising up four leagues <span class='add'>in height</span><br>
that Buddha-stupa shined <span class='add'>so</span> bright.<br>
It illumined all directions<br>
just like the risen raying sun. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw882'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kumbhaṇḍas</i> got together<br>
and counseled one another thus:<br>
“The people and also the gods<br>
the snake-gods and the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>garuḷas</i></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw883'></a> themselves built a superb stupa<br>
for <span class='add'>him</span>, the Best of the Buddhas.<br>
Do not let us be negligent;<br>
heedful, <span class='add'>and</span> with the lesser gods,</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw884'></a> we too shall enlarge <span class='add'>this</span> stupa<br>
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.<br>
We’ll cover the entire extent<br>
of the Buddha’s stupa with gems.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw885'></a> They too increased by one <span class='add'>whole</span> league<br>
the height of the Buddha’s stupa.<br>
<span class='add'>Now</span> rising up five leagues <span class='add'>in height</span><br>
that Buddha-stupa shined forth <span class='add'>bright</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw886'></a> Then spirits got together there<br>
and counseled one another <span class='add'>thus</span>:<br>
“The people, gods, and snake-gods too,<br>
the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>garūḷas</i> and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kumbhaṇḍas</i> <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw887'></a> themselves built a superb stupa<br>
for the World-Chief, the Neutral One.<br>
Do not let us be negligent;<br>
heedful, <span class='add'>and</span> with the lesser gods, <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw888'></a> we too shall enlarge <span class='add'>this</span> stupa<br>
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.<br>
We’ll cover the entire extent<br>
of Buddha’s stupa with crystal.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw889'></a> They too increased by one <span class='add'>whole</span> league<br>
the height of the Buddha’s stupa.<br>
<span class='add'>Now</span> rising up six leagues <span class='add'>in height</span><br>
that Buddha-stupa shined forth <span class='add'>bright</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw890'></a> Then assembled the music-nymphs<br>
<span class='add'>who</span> counseled one another <span class='add'>thus</span>:<br>
“Those born of Manu, and the gods,<br>
snake-gods<i lang='pli' translate='no'>, kumbhaṇḍas, guyhakas</i> <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw891'></a> all constructed Buddha’s stupa;<br>
we’ve done nothing in that regard.<br>
We too shall enlarge <span class='add'>this</span> stupa<br>
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw892'></a> They constructed seven railings<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> made the legs <span class='add'>for it as well</span>.<br>
Then that stupa the music-nymphs<br>
made fully <span class='add'>encased</span> in <span class='add'>fine</span> gold. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw893'></a> <span class='add'>Now</span> rising seven leagues <span class='add'>in height</span><br>
that Buddha-stupa shined forth <span class='add'>bright</span>.<br>
One could not tell the day from night;<br>
there always was <span class='add'>its strong</span> bright light. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw894'></a> Its brilliance actually out-shined<br>
the moon and the sun and the stars.<br>
By day that lamp was blazing forth<br>
for a hundred leagues <span class='add'>all</span> around. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw895'></a> At that time, whichever people<br>
were worshipping that stupa <span class='add'>there</span><br>
did not have to climb that stupa;<br>
they were <span class='add'>just</span> held up in the air. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw896'></a> Their flags or wreaths of flowers <span class='add'>there</span><br>
were offered up <span class='add'>into the air</span><br>
by spirit Abhisammata<br>
who had been placed <span class='add'>there</span> by the gods. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw897'></a> They could not see the spirit <span class='add'>there</span>;<br>
they see the wreaths <span class='add'>just</span> flying by.<br>
Seeing them go by in this way,<br>
all of them go on to good states. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw898'></a> People with faith in Buddha’s words,<br>
and pleased in the dispensation,<br>
wishing to see the miracle<br>
are worshipping that stupa <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw899'></a> At that time I was a speaker<br>
<span class='add'>and I</span> lived in Haṃsavatī.<br>
Seeing those delighted people<br>
this <span class='add'>good</span> thought then occurred to me: <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw900'></a> “He is lofty, the Blessed One,<br>
who has a relic-womb like this;<br>
these people are very happy<br>
doing their rites with devotion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw901'></a> I too shall do a ritual<br>
for the World-Chief, the Neutral One,<br>
and in the future, I shall be<br>
one of the heirs to his doctrines.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw902'></a> I had my upper garment washed<br>
by one whose job was washing clothes<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> having stuck it on bamboo<br>
I raised a flag up in the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw903'></a> Grabbing it, Abhisammata<br>
raised up my flag into the sky.<br>
Seeing it flutter in the wind,<br>
among those folks I smiled a lot. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw904'></a> Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> mind there<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> approached a <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monk.<br>
Worshipping that monk I inquired<br>
what that flag’s result would become. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw905'></a> He told me of religious joy,<br>
generating <span class='add'>great</span> bliss for me.<br>
“You always will experience<br>
the fruit of <span class='add'>your gift of</span> that flag.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw906'></a> <span class='add'>He said</span>, “The army, with four parts—<br>
tusker, soldier, chariot, horse—<br>
will wait on you permanently;<br>
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw907'></a> Sixty thousand instruments <span class='add'>and</span><br>
well-decorated kettle-drums<br>
will attend you permanently;<br>
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw908'></a> And women <span class='add'>too, all</span> well-made-up<br>
numbering eighty-six thousand,<br>
with varied clothes and ornaments,<br>
wearing earrings bearing gemstones, <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw909'></a> with long eyelashes, lovely smiles<br>
and slim waists, pleasant to look at<br>
will wait upon you constantly:<br>
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw910'></a> You’ll delight in the world of gods<br>
for thirty thousand aeons <span class='add'>hence</span>.<br>
Eighty times as the king of gods<br>
you will exercise divine rule. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw911'></a> A thousand times you’re going to be<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and you will have</span> much local rule<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw912'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw913'></a> Falling down from the world of gods,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>your</span> wholesome roots,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> bound up with your good karma<br>
you will be Brahma’s kinsman <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw914'></a> Discarding eight hundred million<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> many slaves <span class='add'>and</span> workers <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
you will renounce in the teaching<br>
of Gotama the Blessed One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw915'></a> Satisfying the Sambuddha,<br>
Gotama, the Bull of Śākyas,<br>
you’ll be known as Upavāna<br>
a follower of the Teacher.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw916'></a> Karma done a hundred thousand<br>
<span class='add'>aeons hence</span> showed me <span class='add'>its</span> fruit here:<br>
well-liberated, arrow-quick,<br>
I have destroyed my defilements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw917'></a> When I was a wheel-turning king,<br>
lord over the four continents,<br>
for three leagues in all directions<br>
flags were always seen by me <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw918'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I did that <span class='add'>good</span> karma then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;<br>
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw919'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
