<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5140'>Walt 5140</a> On a Himalayan mountain,<br>
<span class='add'>I’m</span> Devala the ascetic.<br>
My meditation walkway there<br>
was made by non-human beings. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5141'>Walt 5141</a> Bearing a weight of matted hair,<br>
carrying a water-pot then,<br>
searching for ultimate meaning,<br>
I departed from the forest. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5142'>Walt 5142</a> Eighty-six thousand students <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
waited upon me at that time.<br>
Well-known together with their deeds,<br>
they are living in the forest. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5143'>Walt 5143</a> Going out from the hermitage,<br>
I made a stupa out of sand.<br>
Assembling various flowers,<br>
I worshipped that stupa then. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5144'>Walt 5144</a> Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> heart there,<br>
I <span class='add'>re-</span>entered the hermitage.<br>
All <span class='add'>my</span> students, come together,<br>
questioned me <span class='add'>about</span> what that meant: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5145'>Walt 5145</a> “<span class='add'>All of</span> us would like to find out<br>
which deity you’re honoring<br>
<span class='add'>at that</span> stupa made out of sand:<br>
being asked, please tell <span class='add'>that</span> to us.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5146'>Walt 5146</a> “The Eyeful Ones, Greatly Famed Ones,<br>
have no views <span class='add'>and</span> no magic spells;<br>
they’re the ones I am honoring,<br>
the Best Buddhas, Greatly Famed Ones.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5147'>Walt 5147</a> “In what way are they Great Heroes,<br>
Omniscient Ones, Lords of the World?<br>
What do they look like? What conduct?<br>
In what way are they Greatly Famed?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5148'>Walt 5148</a> “Buddhas have thirty-two great marks,<br>
and also forty <span class='add'>adult</span> teeth.<br>
Their eyes with heifer-eyelashes<br>
resemble wild licorice fruits. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5149'>Walt 5149</a> And when those Buddhas are walking,<br>
they look but a plough’s length ahead.<br>
They do not have a person’s voice;<br>
their euphonic sound is not heard. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5150'>Walt 5150</a> Also, when those Well-Gone-Ones walk,<br>
they lift up <span class='add'>one foot at a time</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>always</span> starting <span class='add'>with</span> the right foot:<br>
that is the nature of Buddhas. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5151'>Walt 5151</a> And those Buddhas are not afraid,<br>
<span class='add'>just</span> like lions, the kings of beasts.<br>
They do not <span class='add'>ever</span> praise themselves,<br>
and don’t revile living beings. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5152'>Walt 5152</a> They are free of pride and contempt,<br>
the same for all living beings.<br>
Buddhas <span class='add'>only</span> praise selflessly:<br>
that is the nature of Buddhas. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5153'>Walt 5153</a> And <span class='add'>when</span> Buddhas are being born,<br>
they radiate light <span class='add'>from themselves</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> in six <span class='add'>different</span> ways they cause<br>
this whole <span class='add'>bountiful</span> earth to quake. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5154'>Walt 5154</a> And they are <span class='add'>able to</span> see hell,<br>
and hell is cooled off at that time.<br>
A massive cloud rains forth <span class='add'>as well</span>:<br>
that is the nature of Buddhas. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5155'>Walt 5155</a> Such-like are those Great Elephants,<br>
Incomparable, of Great Fame;<br>
in beauty they are unsurpassed,<br>
the Thus-Gone-Ones, Beyond Measure.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5156'>Walt 5156</a> All of <span class='add'>my</span> students, respectful,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> expressed <span class='add'>their</span> thanks for my speech,<br>
and likewise went along <span class='add'>with me,</span><br>
as far as they could <span class='add'>and</span> had strength. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5157'>Walt 5157</a> Wishing for <span class='add'>their</span> own <span class='add'>good</span> karma,<br>
they’re worshipping <span class='add'>that</span> sand <span class='add'>stupa</span>.<br>
Having faith in that speech <span class='add'>of mine</span>,<br>
their minds drifted to Buddhahood. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5158'>Walt 5158</a> Then a God’s Son, Greatly Famous,<br>
fell down from Tusitā heaven.<br>
He was born in a mother’s womb,<br>
making the ten-thousand <span class='add'>worlds</span> quake. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5159'>Walt 5159</a> I stood on the walkway which was<br>
near <span class='add'>my</span> hermitage <span class='add'>at that time</span>.<br>
All <span class='add'>my</span> students, having gathered,<br>
came into my presence <span class='add'>just then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5160'>Walt 5160</a> “The earth, bull-like, is bellowing;<br>
it’s roaring like the king of beasts.<br>
It’s shaking like a crocodile;<br>
what will this be the result of?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5161'>Walt 5161</a> “The Buddha I detailed <span class='add'>for you,</span><br>
close to the stupa made of sand,<br>
the Blessed One, the Teacher, now<br>
has been born in a mother’s womb.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5162'>Walt 5162</a> Discussing the Teaching for them,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> having detailed the Great Sage,<br>
exhorting <span class='add'>my</span> own students <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
I sat in lotus position. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5163'>Walt 5163</a> <span class='add'>All</span> my strength was <span class='add'>then</span> exhausted,<br>
due to a serious illness.<br>
Remembering the Best Buddha,<br>
I passed away <span class='add'>right</span> on the spot. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5164'>Walt 5164</a> All <span class='add'>of my</span> students assembled;<br>
they made <span class='add'>me</span> a pyre at that time,<br>
and taking my mortal remains,<br>
they lifted <span class='add'>me</span> onto the pyre. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5165'>Walt 5165</a> Having attended to the pyre,<br>
hands pressed together on <span class='add'>their</span> heads,<br>
wounded by the arrows of grief,<br>
come together they lamented. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5166'>Walt 5166</a> While they were wailing <span class='add'>uselessly,</span><br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> came <span class='add'>back</span> to the pyre <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
“I am your <span class='add'>dead</span> teacher, wise ones;<br>
do not lament <span class='add'>my passing on</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5167'>Walt 5167</a> Endeavor for the highest good,<br>
night and day not being lazy.<br>
Don’t be negligent, all of you;<br>
your moment is offered to you.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28'>Verse 28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5168'>Walt 5168</a> Exhorting <span class='add'>my</span> own students <span class='add'>thus</span>,<br>
I returned to the world of gods.<br>
For eighteen aeons <span class='add'>after that</span><br>
I delighted in the gods’ world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5169'>Walt 5169</a> And <span class='add'>then</span> a hundred times I was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>.<br>
Also another hundred times,<br>
I was a king who turns the wheel.<br>
Also another hundred times<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> exercised divine rule. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30'>Verse 30</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5170'>Walt 5170</a>In the remaining aeons I<br>
transmigrated as god or man.<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of generating. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw31'>Verse 31</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5171'>Walt 5171</a> As in the month of Kattikā,<br>
many trees are in full flower,<br>
likewise in that very season,<br>
I have flowered as a great sage. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw32'>Verse 32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5172'>Walt 5172</a> Vigorous effort’s the yoked ox,<br>
carrying perfect peace for me.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains<br>
I am dwelling without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33'>Verse 33</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5173'>Walt 5173</a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I praised the Buddha <span class='add'>back then</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of praising <span class='add'>Buddhas</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw34'>Verse 34</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5174'>Walt 5174</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw35'>Verse 35</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5175'>Walt 5175</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw36'>Verse 36</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5176'>Walt 5176</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw37'>Verse 37</a></p>
