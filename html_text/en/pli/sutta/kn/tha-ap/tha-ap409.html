<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4072'></a> Near the top of a mountain slope,<br>
the ascetic named Anoma,<br>
making a well-built hermitage,<br>
dwelt in a hall made of leaves then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4073'></a> His practices were successful;<br>
the goal attained by <span class='add'>his</span> own strength.<br>
Heroic in <span class='add'>his</span> own monkhood,<br>
<span class='add'>he</span> was zealous, clever, a sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4074'></a> Confident in his religion,<br>
he was skilled in others’ doctrines,<br>
expert and skillful <span class='add'>in reading</span><br>
omens on earth and in the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4075'></a> Meditating, trance-loving sage,<br>
he did not covet, was grief-free,<br>
happy if receiving or not,<br>
ate little food, did not kill beasts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4076'></a> Piyadassi, the Sambuddha,<br>
Chief, Compassionate One, the Sage,<br>
wishing to help beings across,<br>
spread <span class='add'>the Teaching</span> with compassion. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4077'></a> Piyadassi, the Sage So Great,<br>
seeing folks who could understand,<br>
having gone is exhorting <span class='add'>them,</span><br>
in a thousand universes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4078'></a> With a desire to lift me up,<br>
he <span class='add'>then</span> approached my hermitage.<br>
I had not formerly seen <span class='add'>him,</span><br>
nor heard of him from anyone. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4079'></a> Omens, dreams <span class='add'>and</span> auspicious marks<br>
were very clear to me <span class='add'>back then</span>,<br>
an expert, skilled in horoscopes,<br>
<span class='add'>both</span> on the earth and in the sky. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4080'></a> After hearing of the Buddha,<br>
I gladdened <span class='add'>my</span> heart over him.<br>
Whether eating or sitting down,<br>
I remember <span class='add'>him</span> all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4081'></a> When I was thus remembering,<br>
the Blessed One thought <span class='add'>of me</span> too.<br>
Joy arose in me all the time,<br>
when I thought about the Buddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4082'></a> Returning at a later time,<br>
the Sage So Great came up to me.<br>
When he arrived I did not know<br>
that he’s the Buddha, the Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4083'></a> Full of Pity, Compassionate,<br>
Piyadassi, the Sage So Great,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> introduced himself <span class='add'>to me</span>:<br>
“I am the Buddha in the world.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4084'></a> Coming to know the Sambuddha,<br>
Piyadassi, the Sage So Great,<br>
<span class='add'>filling my</span> own heart with pleasure,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him back then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4085'></a> “You are sitting down on other<br>
chairs and palanquins and deck-chairs,<br>
but you, the Seer of All Things,<br>
should sit upon a gem-set throne. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4086'></a> At that time <span class='add'>someone</span> created<br>
a chair made out of all the gems,<br>
a magically-created seat<br>
for Piyadassi, the Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4087'></a> Then I gave a rose-apple fruit,<br>
as big as a jug of water,<br>
to <span class='add'>Buddha</span> seated on <span class='add'>that</span> chair<br>
magically-fashioned out of gems. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4088'></a> <span class='add'>At that time</span> the Great Sage ate <span class='add'>it</span>,<br>
generating <span class='add'>great</span> mirth for me.<br>
Then bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
I saluted <span class='add'>him</span>, the Teacher. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4089'></a> But Piyadassi, Blessed One,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
sitting upon <span class='add'>that</span> gem-set throne,<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me then</span>: <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4090'></a> “He who gave me <span class='add'>this</span> gem-set chair<br>
and <span class='add'>also this</span> ambrosial fruit,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words: <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4091'></a> “For seventy-seven aeons<br>
he’ll delight in the world of gods,<br>
and fifty-seven times he’ll be<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4092'></a> Thirty-two times the lord of gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule,<br>
<span class='add'>and there will be</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4093'></a> He will receive seats made of gems<br>
and also made out of rubies,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> many palanquins well-made<br>
out of gold <span class='add'>and</span> out of silver. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4094'></a> Even when walking back and forth,<br>
palanquins of different sorts,<br>
all the time will wait upon<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> man possessing good karma. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4095'></a> Huts with gables and palaces,<br>
and beds which are very costly,<br>
all of the time will come to be,<br>
discerning what he is thinking. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4096-4097'></a> <span class='add'>And</span> sixty thousand elephants,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>mātaṅgas</i> with gold headdresses,<br>
clothed in harnessing made of gold,<br>
mounted by elephant-trainers<br>
with lances and goads in hand,<br>
are going to wait on this <span class='add'>man</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of a gem-set chair. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25-26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4098-4099'></a> Sixty thousand horses <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
thoroughbreds of good pedigree,<br>
horses from Sindh, fast vehicles,<br>
mounted by trainers of horses<br>
wearing armor with bows in hand,<br>
are going to wait on this <span class='add'>man</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of a gem-set chair. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27-28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4100-4101'></a> Sixty thousand chariots <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
covered in the skins of leopards<br>
and likewise tigers, flags hoisted,<br>
mounted by animal-trainers<br>
wearing armor with bows in hand,<br>
will constantly wait on this <span class='add'>man</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of a gem-set chair. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29-30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4102'></a> Sixty thousand milch-cows <span class='add'>as well,</span><br>
red in color, best of the best,<br>
will give birth to <span class='add'>many good</span> calves:<br>
that’s the fruit of a gem-set chair. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4103-4104'></a> Sixty thousand women <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
decked out in all the ornaments,<br>
with varied clothes and jewelry<br>
and wearing earrings made of gems,<br>
with long eyelashes, lovely smiles<br>
and slim waists, pleasant to look at,<br>
constantly will wait on this <span class='add'>man</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of a gem-set chair. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32-33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4105'></a> Eighteen hundred aeons <span class='add'>from now,</span><br>
the Eyeful One named Gotama,<br>
doing away with the darkness,<br>
will be the Buddha in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4106'></a> Coming to look at him, <span class='add'>this man</span><br>
will go forth having nothing.<br>
Satisfying the Teacher, he’ll<br>
delight in the dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4107'></a> Having listened to his Teaching,<br>
he will destroy the defilements.<br>
Knowing well all the defilements,<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4108'></a> Vigorous effort’s the yoked ox<br>
carrying perfect peace for me.<br>
Wishing for ultimate meaning,<br>
I dwell in the dispensation. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4109'></a> This is the final time for me;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth is proceeding.<br>
All defilements are exhausted;<br>
now there will be no more rebirth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4110'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4111'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4112'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
