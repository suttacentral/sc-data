<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6076'>Walt 6076</a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the One with Eyes for everything,<br>
the Leader <span class='add'>of the World,</span> arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6077'>Walt 6077</a> His morals could not be measured,<br>
meditative states like lightening,<br>
vast knowledge could not be measured,<br>
and freedom unlike anything. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6078'>Walt 6078</a> The Leader preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to<br>
the men, the gods, the snake-gods <span class='add'>and</span><br>
the Brahmās <span class='add'>all</span> come together,<br>
mixed with <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monks and brahmins. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6079'>Walt 6079</a> Confident among Multitudes,<br>
the <span class='add'>Buddha</span> placed a merit-filled,<br>
much-receiving <span class='add'>and</span> gift-worthy<br>
follower in that foremost place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6080'>Walt 6080</a> I was a kṣatriyan back then,<br>
in the city named “Haṃsa;”<br>
hearing the Victor’s words <span class='add'>about</span><br>
the follower’s virtuousness, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6081'>Walt 6081</a> inviting <span class='add'>Buddha</span>, for a week<br>
I fed <span class='add'>him</span> with <span class='add'>his</span> followers.<br>
Giving a massive alms-giving,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6082'>Walt 6082</a> Then <span class='add'>he</span>, the Bull Among People,<br>
seeing me bowing at <span class='add'>his</span> feet,<br>
the Great Hero, in <span class='add'>his</span> good voice,<br>
uttered these words <span class='add'>concerning me</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6083-6085'>Walt 6083-6085</a> Then the multitude, desiring<br>
to hear the words of the Victor,<br>
the gods, titans, musical nymphs,<br>
the greatly powerful Brahmās,<br>
and the <span class='add'>Buddhist</span> monks, and brahmins,<br>
praised <span class='add'>him</span> with hands pressed together:<br>
“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person!<br>
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!<br>
For a week <span class='add'>this</span> kṣatriyan gave<br>
a massive alms-giving to you.<br>
<span class='add'>We</span> wish to hear the fruit for him;<br>
prophesy <span class='add'>that</span>, O Sage So Great.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8-10'>Verse 8-10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6086-6087'>Walt 6086-6087</a> After that, the Blessed One said,<br>
“<span class='add'>All of</span> you listen to my words:<br>
Who can tell the <span class='add'>fruit of the</span> gift<br>
well-established for the Buddha<br>
<span class='add'>or</span> Assembly, beyond measure?<br>
It will bear fruit beyond measure.<br>
This rich man is truly wishing<br>
<span class='add'>to attain</span> that ultimate place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11-12'>Verse 11-12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6088'>Walt 6088</a> He’ll be a getter of huge wealth,<br>
just like the monk Sudassana,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> also just like me <span class='add'>as well</span>;<br>
he’ll receive that in the future. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6089'>Walt 6089</a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6090'>Walt 6090</a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Sīvali<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6091'>Walt 6091</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6092'>Walt 6092</a> <span class='add'>Then</span> ninety-one aeons ago,<br>
the World-Leader <span class='add'>named</span> Vipassi<br>
arose, the One with Lovely Eyes,<br>
with Insight into Everything. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6093'>Walt 6093</a> Then I <span class='add'>lived</span> in Bandhumatī,<br>
<span class='add'>a member</span> of a certain clan;<br>
I was pitied and sought after,<br>
one intent on ending karma. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6094'>Walt 6094</a> Then a certain corporation<br>
constructed a monastic school<br>
for the Great Sage <span class='add'>named</span> Vipassi,<br>
which was large and widely renowned. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6095'>Walt 6095</a> Searching for new curds and honey<br>
to give along with solid food<br>
at the end of the great alms-gift,<br>
they did not find <span class='add'>any to give</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6096'>Walt 6096</a> Then having taken <span class='add'>some</span> of that,<br>
new curds and also honey too,<br>
I went to the overseer’s house,<br>
and seeking that they saw me. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6097-6098'>Walt 6097-6098</a> Even offering a thousand,<br>
they did not obtain those two <span class='add'>things</span>.<br>
I thought <span class='add'>about it</span> then like this:<br>
“That <span class='add'>price</span> would not be too little.<br>
As far as all these people are<br>
honoring <span class='add'>him</span>, the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
I too will do a <span class='add'>pious</span> deed,<br>
for the World-Lord with Assembly.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22-23'>Verse 22-23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6099'>Walt 6099</a> Then having thought <span class='add'>it out</span> like that,<br>
mixing together the curds and<br>
the honey, I gave <span class='add'>them</span> to the<br>
Lord of the World with Assembly. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6100'>Walt 6100</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6101'>Walt 6101</a> Again, in Benares, being<br>
a king <span class='add'>who was</span> very famous,<br>
enraged at an enemy <span class='add'>then,</span><br>
I caused the gateway to be blocked. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6102'>Walt 6102</a> Then, obstructing ascetics <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>it</span> was guarded thus for a week.<br>
Therefore, as the result of that<br>
karma, I fell hard into hell. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6103-6104'>Walt 6103-6104</a> And now in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
due to the kṣatriyan’s good deeds,<br>
I’m born in Koliya city;<br>
my mother was Suppavāsā,<br>
father Mahāli Licchavi.<br>
Because of obstructing the gate,<br>
I gestated for seven years,<br>
suffering in <span class='add'>my</span> mother’s womb. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28-29'>Verse 28-29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6105'>Walt 6105</a> One week breached in the birth canal,<br>
I’m endowed with great suffering.<br>
Because she gave approval <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
my mother suffered greatly <span class='add'>now</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30'>Verse 30</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6106'>Walt 6106</a> Departing from Śrāvasti, I<br>
was pitied by <span class='add'>him</span>, the Buddha;<br>
on the very day I set out,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw31'>Verse 31</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6107'>Walt 6107</a> My preceptor: Sāriputta;<br>
powerful Moggallāna, the<br>
wise, instructed me <span class='add'>as teacher</span><br>
<span class='add'>while he was</span> removing my hair. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw32'>Verse 32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6108'>Walt 6108</a> While my hair was being cut off,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.<br>
Gods, snake-gods and human beings<br>
are bringing me the requisites. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33'>Verse 33</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6109'>Walt 6109</a> Because, delighted, I worshipped<br>
<span class='add'>Buddha</span> named Padumuttara<br>
and the Guide, Vipassi <span class='add'>Buddha</span>,<br>
I’m distinguished with requisites. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw34'>Verse 34</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6110'>Walt 6110</a> Due to the distinction of those<br>
deeds, I’m receiving everywhere<br>
enormous <span class='add'>and</span> ultimate wealth,<br>
in woods, village, water <span class='add'>and</span> land. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw35'>Verse 35</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6111-6113'>Walt 6111-6113</a> When the Guide is traveling for<br>
the sake of seeing Revata,<br>
the World’s Chief Leader together<br>
with thirty times a thousand monks,<br>
the Great Wise One, the Great Hero,<br>
the World’s Chief Leader with the monks,<br>
the Buddha’s then served by me with<br>
requisites the gods bring for me;<br>
having gone he saw Revata,<br>
then going to Jetavana,<br>
<span class='add'>he</span> placed me in that foremost place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw36-38'>Verse 36-38</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6114'>Walt 6114</a> The Teacher, Friend of Every World,<br>
praised me amidst the multitude:<br>
“O monks, Sīvali’s the foremost<br>
receiver among my students.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw39'>Verse 39</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6115'>Walt 6115</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw40'>Verse 40</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6116'>Walt 6116</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw41'>Verse 41</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6117'>Walt 6117</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw42'>Verse 42</a></p>
