<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw374'>Walt 374</a> Anomadassi, Blessed One,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
was living in the Himalayas,<br>
Honored by the Gods’ Assembly. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw375'>Walt 375</a> I was then a king of snake-gods,<br>
known by the name of Varuṇa.<br>
Taking on the form of Cupid<br>
I was dwelling in the ocean. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw376'>Walt 376</a> Being in a musical group,<br>
I provided the percussion.<br>
After serving the Sambuddha,<br>
the divine nymphs then sang <span class='add'>their songs</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw377'>Walt 377</a> When the drums were being beaten<br>
the gods then also beat on drums.<br>
Upon hearing the sound of both,<br>
the Buddha himself then listened. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw378'>Walt 378</a> Having invited Sambuddha<br>
that he come over to my house,<br>
providing an appointed seat.<br>
I announced that it was <span class='add'>now</span> time. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw379'>Walt 379</a> With one thousand flawless arahants<br>
following behind, that World-Chief,<br>
shining light in all directions<br>
did come over to my house <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw380'>Walt 380</a> I satisfied with food and drink<br>
the Great Hero who had arrived,<br>
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men<br>
along with the monks’ Assembly. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw381'>Walt 381</a> The Great Hero was delighted,<br>
the Self-Existent, Top Human;<br>
seated in the monks’ Assembly<br>
he spoke these verses <span class='add'>about me</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw382'>Walt 382</a> “He who worshipped the assembly<br>
and also the Buddha, World-Chief,<br>
due to the pleasure in <span class='add'>his</span> heart,<br>
will go into the world of gods. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw383'>Walt 383</a> He will exercise divine rule<br>
seventy-seven <span class='add'>different</span> times.<br>
He will reside upon the earth,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> have eight hundred earthly reigns. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw384'>Walt 384</a> And he’ll be a wheel-turning king<br>
five and fifty <span class='add'>different</span> times.<br>
All the time they will bring for him<br>
uncountable <span class='add'>amounts of</span> wealth. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw385'>Walt 385</a> Aeons beyond measure from now,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw386'>Walt 386</a> After having come out of hell<br>
he will go to a human state.<br>
Known by the name of Kolita<br>
he’ll be a kinsman of Brahma. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw387'>Walt 387</a> He’ll afterwards go forth, renouncing,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>his</span> wholesome roots.<br>
He’ll be second chief-follower<br>
of the Blessed One, Gotama. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw388'>Walt 388</a> Resolved, with strenuous effort,<br>
he’ll excel in superpowers.<br>
Knowing well all the defilements<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw389'>Walt 389</a> Depending on <span class='add'>some</span> evil friends,<br>
overpowered by lust <span class='add'>and</span> anger,<br>
being cruel-minded I slew<br>
my mother and my father too. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw390'>Walt 390</a> In whichever womb I’m reborn<br>
in hell or <span class='add'>else</span> among humans<br>
since I possess that bad karma<br>
I get murdered, head split open. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw391'>Walt 391</a> This is the final time for me;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth is proceeding.<br>
And also here, like that, for me<br>
a time for getting killed will be. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw392'>Walt 392</a> Binding <span class='add'>myself</span> to solitude,<br>
fond of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>samādhi</i>-meditation,<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> living, undefiled. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw393'>Walt 393</a> Excelling in superpowers<br>
I shake with only my left thumb<br>
this very earth which is so deep,<br>
thick and difficult to destroy. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw394'>Walt 394</a> I don’t feel the pride of “I am;”<br>
no pride at all exists in me.<br>
Even regarding novices<br>
I act with reverence in <span class='add'>my</span> heart. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw395'>Walt 395</a> I brought forward the karma done<br>
in an aeon so long ago.<br>
That I has now attained the earth;<br>
I’ve reached the end of defilements. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw396'>Walt 396</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw397'>Walt 397</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw398'>Walt 398</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
