<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3341'>Walt 3341</a> Near the lake called Anotatta,<br>
on the lovely level rock ground,<br>
where sparkled gems of different sorts<br>
and varied perfumes <span class='add'>filled</span> the woods, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3342'>Walt 3342</a> surrounded by the Assembly<br>
of monks, the Leader of the World,<br>
while seated there, did <span class='add'>then</span> explain<br>
the former deeds done by himself: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3343'>Walt 3343</a> Hear from me, O monks, the karma<br>
<span class='add'>which formerly was</span> done by me,<br>
<span class='add'>and how</span> those karma rags’ <span class='add'>effects</span><br>
ripen in the Buddha himself. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3344'>Walt 3344</a> Among <span class='add'>my</span> other, former births<br>
I was a jerk named Munāli.<br>
I told lies about Sarabhu,<br>
an innocent Lonely Buddha. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3345'>Walt 3345</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
a long time I circled through hell.<br>
I experienced suffering<br>
for numerous thousands of years. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3346'>Walt 3346</a> As <span class='add'>its</span> final karmic effect,<br>
here in <span class='add'>my</span> final existence,<br>
I received <span class='add'>some nasty</span> slander<br>
connected with Sundarīkā. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3347'>Walt 3347</a> I was Nanda, a follower<br>
of the Buddha Sabbābhibhu.<br>
My transmigration was in hell<br>
for long after I slandered him. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3348'>Walt 3348</a> My long transmigration in hell<br>
<span class='add'>continued for</span> ten thousand years.<br>
When I <span class='add'>again</span> got human birth,<br>
I <span class='add'>also</span> got lots of slander. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3349'>Walt 3349</a> Through what remained of that karma,<br>
Lady Ciñca did slander me<br>
in front of a group of people<br>
without any grounding in fact. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3350'>Walt 3350</a> I was an erudite brahmin,<br>
attended on, given worship.<br>
In a large wood, I was teaching<br>
mantras to five hundred young men. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3351'>Walt 3351</a> To that place had come Sage Gīma,<br>
who possessed vast superpowers.<br>
After having seen him coming,<br>
I slandered that blameless <span class='add'>person</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3352'>Walt 3352</a> I said <span class='add'>this</span> to my students then:<br>
“this sage delights in the pleasures!”<br>
The young men <span class='add'>there</span> took <span class='add'>that</span> to heart<br>
when I made that declaration. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3353'>Walt 3353</a> Then all the young men, <span class='add'>my students</span>,<br>
begging for alms from clan to clan,<br>
repeated to a lot of folks,<br>
“this sage delights in the pleasures!” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3354'>Walt 3354</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
these five hundred monks <span class='add'>now with me</span><br>
all received <span class='add'>some nasty</span> slander<br>
connected with Sundarīkā. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3355'>Walt 3355</a> One time eying wealth I murdered<br>
brothers by a second mother.<br>
I put <span class='add'>them</span> on a mountain road<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> crushed <span class='add'>them</span> in an avalanche. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3356'>Walt 3356</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
Devadatta threw a boulder<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> a splinter <span class='add'>off that boulder</span><br>
<span class='add'>then</span> crushed the big toe on my foot. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3357'>Walt 3357</a> One time I was a little boy,<br>
playing by the great thoroughfare.<br>
Having seen a Lonely Buddha,<br>
I threw a clod of dirt <span class='add'>at him</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3358'>Walt 3358</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
here in <span class='add'>my</span> final existence,<br>
Devadatta hired <span class='add'>some</span> killers<br>
for the sake of murdering me. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3359'>Walt 3359</a> Once, while I was on <span class='add'>my</span> tusker,<br>
I saw a supreme Lonely Sage,<br>
wandering about for alms food—<br>
with elephant I attacked him. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3360'>Walt 3360</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
the elephant Nāḷāgiri,<br>
agitated, cruel, approached me<br>
in the fine town at Vulture’s Peak. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3361'>Walt 3361</a> I was the king, <span class='add'>named</span> Patthiva;<br>
I killed a man with a dagger.<br>
As a result of that karma,<br>
I roasted in hell a long time. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3362'>Walt 3362</a> Through what remained of that karma,<br>
the skin on my foot got all cracked<br>
and caused me a lot of trouble—<br>
karma sure doesn’t just vanish! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3363'>Walt 3363</a> I <span class='add'>once</span> lived as a fisher-boy,<br>
in a village of fishermen.<br>
Having seen the fish getting killed,<br>
pleasurable thoughts filled my mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3364'>Walt 3364</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
I suffered a headache <span class='add'>one time</span>;<br>
all of the Śākyans were murdered,<br>
when Viḍuḍabha murdered <span class='add'>them</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3365'>Walt 3365</a> I reviled the holy words <span class='add'>and</span><br>
followers of Phussa <span class='add'>Buddha</span>,<br>
“chomp <span class='add'>and</span> eat <span class='add'>inferior</span> grain<br>
you all, and don’t eat <span class='add'>any</span> rice.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3366'>Walt 3366</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
I <span class='add'>had to</span> eat grain for three months<br>
when, invited by a brahmin,<br>
I lived in various kingdoms. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3367'>Walt 3367</a> In the midst of a wrestling match,<br>
a wrestler’s son, I blocked <span class='add'>the fight</span>;<br>
as a result of that karma,<br>
<span class='add'>one time</span> I suffered a backache. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3368'>Walt 3368</a> I was a <span class='add'>practicing</span> doctor<br>
and purged the son of a rich man;<br>
as a result of that karma,<br>
I contracted dysentery. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28'>Verse 28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3369'>Walt 3369</a> One time I, Jotipāla, said<br>
to Kassapa, the Well-Gone-One,<br>
“Whence then this baldy’s Waking Up,<br>
Awakening so hard to reach?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3370'>Walt 3370</a> As a result of that karma,<br>
I practiced great austerities<br>
in Uruvela, six <span class='add'>long</span> years,<br>
and then achieved Awakening. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30'>Verse 30</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3371-72'>Walt 3371-72</a>“Along that path I did not reach<br>
supreme Awakening,” <span class='add'>I thought</span>,<br>
“along which path then should I search,<br>
hindered by previous karma?<br>
Exhausting good and bad <span class='add'>karma</span><br>
<span class='add'>and</span> avoiding every torment<br>
free of grief, troubles <span class='add'>and</span> outflows,<br>
I shall realize nirvana.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw31-32'>Verse 31-32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3373'>Walt 3373</a> Thus did he explain, the Victor,<br>
Endowed with All Superpowers,<br>
in front of the monks’ Assembly,<br>
at the great Lake Anotatta. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33'>Verse 33</a></p>
