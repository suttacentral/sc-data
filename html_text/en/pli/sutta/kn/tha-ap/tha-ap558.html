<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6385'></a> The Sambuddha named Sumedha,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks,<br>
Seclusion-Lover, Blessed One,<br>
came up to the Himalayas.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6386'></a> Plunged into the Himalayas,<br>
the Chief, Compassionate, the Sage,<br>
getting into lotus posture,<br>
sat down, the Ultimate Person.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6387'></a> I was a sorcerer back then,<br>
<span class='add'>one who could</span> travel through the sky;<br>
taking my well-gone trident I<br>
was going through the sky <span class='add'>right there</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6388'></a> Like fire <span class='add'>burning</span> on a mountain,<br>
like the moon on the fifteenth day,<br>
the Buddha blazed forth in the woods,<br>
like a regal <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> tree in bloom.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6389'></a> Coming down from atop the woods,<br>
the Buddha’s rays filled <span class='add'>all of</span> space,<br>
with the color of a reed-fire.<br>
Seeing <span class='add'>that</span>, I pleased <span class='add'>my own</span> heart.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6390'></a> Wandering, I saw a flower,<br>
a dinner-plate with divine scent.<br>
Carrying three <span class='add'>of those</span> flowers,<br>
I offered <span class='add'>them</span> to the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6391'></a> Through Buddha’s majestic power,<br>
<span class='add'>just</span> then those three flowers of mine,<br>
stems turned upward, petals downward,<br>
they’re making shade for the Teacher.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6392'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6393'></a> There my well-constructed mansion<br>
was known <span class='add'>by the name</span> “Dinner-Plate.”<br>
It <span class='add'>measured</span> sixty leagues in length,<br>
<span class='add'>and it was</span> thirty leagues in width.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6394'></a> A hundred thousand pinnacles,<br>
a mil-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>kaṇḍa</i> cent-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>bheṇḍu</i> <span class='add'>large</span>,<br>
made of gold, covered in flags,<br>
appeared for me on that mansion.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6395'></a> Palanquins made out of crystal,<br>
made of gold <span class='add'>or</span> made of gemstones,<br>
and also made out of rubies,<br>
go where I wish if I should wish.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6396'></a> And there was an expensive bed,<br>
which had an assembled mattress,<br>
with a wool blanket on one end,<br>
and furnished with <span class='add'>lots of</span> pillows.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6397'></a> Going out from the palace, I’m<br>
wandering in divine travels,<br>
going according to <span class='add'>my</span> wish,<br>
honored by the gods’ assembly.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6398'></a> I stand on flowers underneath;<br>
a canopy is above me.<br>
A hundred leagues on every side<br>
is covered with dinner-plate <span class='add'>trees</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6399'></a> <span class='add'>There</span> sixty thousand instruments<br>
wait on me evening and morning.<br>
They’re attending me constantly,<br>
by night and day they’re not lazy.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6400'></a> I delight in play and pleasures;<br>
desiring desires, I rejoice<br>
due to the dances and singing,<br>
the percussion and speeches there.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6401'></a> Eating and drinking there I’m then<br>
rejoicing among the thirty,<br>
together with troops of women<br>
I rejoice in <span class='add'>my</span> great mansion.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6402'></a> And five hundred <span class='add'>different</span> times,<br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>.<br>
And three hundred <span class='add'>different</span> times,<br>
I was a king who turns the wheel.<br>
<span class='add'>And I enjoyed</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6403'></a> Transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I receive many possessions.<br>
I have no lack of possessions:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6404'></a> I transmigrate in <span class='add'>just</span> two states:<br>
that of a god, or of a man.<br>
I know no other rebirth <span class='add'>state</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6405'></a> I am born in the two <span class='add'>high</span> clans,<br>
kṣatriyan and also brahmin.<br>
I’m not aware of lesser clans:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6406'></a> Elephant- <span class='add'>and</span> horse-vehicles,<br>
palanquins <span class='add'>and</span> chariots <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
I am receiving all of that:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6407'></a> Troops of slaves <span class='add'>and</span> troops of slave-girls,<br>
and women who are all decked out,<br>
I am receiving all of that:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6408'></a>Silk material, woolen stuff,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>khoma</i> cloth and cotton <span class='add'>goods too</span>,<br>
I am receiving all of that:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6409'></a> New clothing and fruit which is fresh,<br>
pure food of foremost tastiness,<br>
I am receiving all of that:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6410'></a> <span class='add'>People saying,</span> “eat this, enjoy<br>
this, please lie down on this <span class='add'>fine</span> bed,”<br>
I am receiving all of that:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6411'></a> Everywhere I’m given honor<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> I have very lofty fame,<br>
always in the majority,<br>
my retinue has no factions.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6412'></a> I’m not aware of cold <span class='add'>nor</span> heat,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> burning fever is not known.<br>
Likewise there is not found in me,<br>
suffering of the mind <span class='add'>or</span> heart.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6413'></a> Having been the color of gold,<br>
I transmigrate from birth to birth.<br>
I do not know a bad color:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6414'></a> Falling down from the world of gods,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>my</span> wholesome roots,<br>
I am reborn in Śrāvasti,<br>
in a wealthy <span class='add'>clan</span> with big halls.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6415'></a> Giving up the five sense pleasures,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
Being <span class='add'>only</span> seven years old,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6416'></a> Knowing <span class='add'>my</span> virtue, the Buddha,<br>
the Eyeful One, <span class='add'>then</span> ordained <span class='add'>me</span>.<br>
A young boy worthy of honor:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6417'></a> The divine eye is purified;<br>
I’m skilled in meditative states.<br>
Special knowledges perfected:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6418'></a> Analytical modes attained,<br>
skilled in <span class='add'>all</span> the superpowers,<br>
perfect in special knowledges:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6419'></a> In the thirty thousand aeons<br>
since I worshipped the Buddha <span class='add'>then</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of Buddha-<i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6420'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6421'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6422'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
