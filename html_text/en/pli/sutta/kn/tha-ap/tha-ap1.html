<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1' href='#jw1'>Walt 1</a> The Sage of Vedeha, his body bent, asked<br>
the Thus-Gone-One dwelling in Jetavana,<br>
“Indeed there are those <span class='add'>called</span> Omniscient Buddhas;<br>
through what causes do they become <span class='add'>so</span>, Hero?”</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2' href='#jw2'>Walt 2</a> Then spoke the Omniscient, Outstanding, Great Sage,<br>
to lucky Ānanda with <span class='add'>his</span> honeyed voice,<br>
“Who performed service among former Buddhas,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> didn’t get freed in their dispensations,</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3' href='#jw3'>Walt 3</a> because that is the means to awaken, wise,<br>
they with sharp knowing, through knowledge and power,<br>
because of <span class='add'>their</span> wishes <span class='add'>and</span> also great strength,<br>
do come to attain that state of omniscience.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4' href='#jw4'>Walt 4</a> I too among former Buddhas<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw7' href='#jw7'>Walt 7</a> I brought it all forth with my mind:<br>
things on the ground and in the sky,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw8' href='#jw8'>Walt 8</a> I created a palace there,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw16' href='#jw16'>Walt 16</a> A garland of flags was hoisted,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw22' href='#jw22'>Walt 22</a> I conjured up all past Buddhas,<br>
