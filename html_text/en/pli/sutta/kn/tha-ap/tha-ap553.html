<p><a class='jw' id='jw6331'></a> Floating in the great ocean, my<br>
palace <span class='add'>then</span> was very well-made.<br>
There was a pond, <span class='add'>also</span> well made,<br>
<span class='add'>full of</span> the cries of ruddy geese,</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6332'></a> covered with <i lang='pli' translate='no'>mandālaka</i> blooms<br>
and with pink and blue lotuses.<br>
And a river was flowing there,<br>
beautiful, with excellent banks,</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6333'></a> covered with fish and tortoises,<br>
with various birds spread about,<br>
noisy with peacocks <span class='add'>and</span> herons,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> the <span class='add'>calls of birds</span> like cuckoos.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6334'></a> Pigeons <span class='add'>and</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>ravi</i>-swans <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
ruddy geese and <i lang='pli' translate='no'>nadīcaras</i>,<br>
lapwings <span class='add'>and</span> mynah birds are here,<br>
small monkeys, <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jīvajīvakas</i>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6335'></a> <span class='add'>It</span> resounds with swans and herons,<br>
owls and many <i lang='pli' translate='no'>piṅgalas</i>.<br>
The sand contains the seven gems,<br>
<span class='add'>strewn with</span> jewels <span class='add'>and costly</span> pearls.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6336'></a> All of the trees, made out of gold,<br>
pervaded by various scents,<br>
are lighting up my palace <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
by day and night, all of the time.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6337'></a> Sixty thousand instruments are<br>
being played morning and evening.<br>
Sixteen thousand women <span class='add'>as well</span><br>
are waiting on me constantly.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6338'></a> Happy, with pleasure in <span class='add'>my</span> heart,<br>
having departed <span class='add'>my</span> palace,<br>
I worshipped that Greatly Famed One,<br>
Sumedha, Leader of the World.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6339'></a> Having greeted the Sambuddha,<br>
inviting him <span class='add'>and</span> Assembly,<br>
that Wise One then agreed <span class='add'>to come</span>,<br>
Sumedha, Leader of the World.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6340'></a> Having preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to me,<br>
the Great Sage <span class='add'>later</span> took his leave.<br>
Having greeted the Sambuddha,<br>
I returned to my palace <span class='add'>then</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6341'></a> I summoned <span class='add'>all</span> the people there:<br>
“All of you gather together.<br>
In the first part of the day,<br>
the Buddha will come to the palace.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6342'></a> “We dwelling near you have received<br>
something that’s well-gotten for us.<br>
We too will do a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pūjā</i> for<br>
the Teacher, the Best of Buddhas.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6343'></a> After putting up food <span class='add'>and</span> drink,<br>
I announced that it was the time.<br>
The Leader of the World arrived<br>
with one hundred thousand masters.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6344'></a> I went to meet <span class='add'>him</span> with the five<br>
musical instruments <span class='add'>sounding</span>.<br>
The Supreme Person sat down on<br>
a chair made out of solid gold.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6345'></a> I placed a canopy above,<br>
which was made out of solid gold;<br>
fans are then diffusing <span class='add'>perfumes</span><br>
within the Assembly of monks.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6346'></a> I regaled the monks’ Assembly<br>
with large amounts of food <span class='add'>and</span> drink;<br>
I gave individual pairs<br>
of cloth to the monks’ Assembly.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6347'></a> The one whom they called Sumedha,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
sitting in the monks’ Assembly,<br>
spoke these <span class='add'>six</span> verses <span class='add'>at that time</span>:</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6348'></a> “This one who <span class='add'>gave</span> me food and drink<br>
and fed all of these <span class='add'>monks</span> with it,<br>
I shall relate details of him;<br>
<span class='add'>all of</span> you listen to my words:</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6349'></a> For eighteen hundred aeons he<br>
will delight in the world of gods.<br>
A thousand times he’ll be a king,<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6350'></a> In whichever womb he’s reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
a canopy of solid gold<br>
will always be carried <span class='add'>for him</span>.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6351'></a> In thirty thousand aeons <span class='add'>hence</span>,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6352'></a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
knowing well all the defilements,<br>
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6353'></a> Sitting in the monks’ Assembly<br>
he will <span class='add'>then</span> roar the lion’s roar.<br>
On <span class='add'>his</span> pyre an umbrella’s borne;<br>
beneath it he is cremated.”</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6354'></a> Monkhood has been attained by me;<br>
my defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up.<br>
In a pavilion or tree-root,<br>
burning heat is not known by me.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6355'></a> In the thirty thousand aeons<br>
since I gave that gift at that time,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
the fruit of giving everything.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6356'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6357'></a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6358'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>

<p>Thus indeed Venerable Yasa Thera spoke these verses.</p>
