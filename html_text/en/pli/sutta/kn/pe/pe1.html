<h1>I. The Display of the Noble Truths</h1>
</header>
<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<h3>The Arising of Right View</h3>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en1' href='#pts-vp-en1'>PTS vp En 1</a>1.<a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli1' href='#pts-vp-pli1'>PTS vp Pli 1</a> Homage to the Fully Enlightened Ones, who see the ultimate meaning (aim), who have reached perfection in the qualities beginning with virtue.</p>
<p>2. There are two causes, two conditions, for the arising of a hearer's right view: they are another's utterance sequential upon truth,  and reasoned attention in oneself.</p>
<p>3. Herein, what is <i>another's utterance</i>? It is any teaching, advice, instruction, talk about truth, in conformity with truth, from another. The Truths are four: they are Suffering, Origin, Cessation, and the Path. Any teaching, showing, divulging, analysing, exhibiting, displaying these four Truths is called another's utterance in conformity with truth.</p>
<p>4. Herein, what is <i>reasoned attention in oneself</i>? What is called reasoned attention in oneself is any reasoned attention given to the True Idea as taught, without adducing any external object; this is called reasoned attention. That mood, when reasoned, is a door-way, a directive, a means (?).</p>
<p>Just as a man is capable of arriving at kindling when on dry ground he rubs a dry sapless log with a dry upper fire-stick—<a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli2' href='#pts-vp-pli2'>PTS vp Pli 2</a> Why is that? Because of his arriving at fire with reasoning—so too when he gives attention to this teaching of the undistorted True Idea of Suffering, Origin, Cessation, and Path, this is called reasoned attention, <span class='add'>[occurring Spontaneously]</span> as the three similes <span class='add'>[in the Mahā-Saccaka Sutta]</span> occurred <span class='add'>[to the Bodhisatta]</span> not having been previously heard, previously unheard, <span class='add'>[by him]</span>. Now <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en2' href='#pts-vp-en2'>PTS vp En 2</a> the <span class='add'>[first]</span> two <span class='add'>[of the three]</span> similes <span class='add'>[beginning]</span> “Whoever is not without lust for sensual desires” must be treated as <span class='add'>[applying to]</span> unreasoned attention, but in the last it is well stated <span class='add'>[for application to reasoned attention]</span>.</p>
<p>5. Herein, another's utterance and reasoned attention in oneself: these are the two conditions. Understanding that arises owing to another's utterance is called understanding consisting in what is heard; understanding that arises owing to reasoned attention in oneself is called understanding consisting in cogitation: these are the two kinds of understanding recognizable. And the two conditions <span class='add'>[mentioned]</span> first: these are the “two causes, two conditions, for the arising of a hearer's right view”.</p>
<p>6. Herein, that one who does not cognize the meaning (aim) of another's utterance when taught sequential upon truth will be one who experiences the meaning: no such instance is found. And that one who does not experience the meaning (aim) will give reasoned attention: no such instance is found. But that one who cognizes the meaning of another's utterance when taught sequential upon truth will be one who experiences the meaning: such an instance is found. And that one who experiences the meaning will give reasoned attention: such an instance is found. This is the cause, this is the object, this is the means, for the hearer's outlet, there is no other.</p>
<p>7. <span class='add'>[If]</span> this <span class='add'>[hearing]</span> is not conjoined with cognizing the Thread's meaning (aim), then by following only the sound of the utterance without cognizing the meaning of another's utterance no one can arrive at any more-than-human idea worthy of a Noble One's knowing and seeing. Therefore meanings must be sought by one desirous of attaining extinction <span class='add'>[of lust, hate, and delusion]</span>.</p>

<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en4' href='#pts-vp-en4'>PTS vp En 4</a>10. Herein, what are the five Guide-Lines? They are:</p>
<ol type='i'>
<li>the Conversion of Relishing,</li>
<li>the Trefoil,</li>

<li>the Plotting of Directions,</li>
<li>the Hook.</li>

The Plotting of Directions, then<br>
The Hook is What they call the fifth:<br>
That is how all five Guide-Lines go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>11. Herein, what are the eighteen <i>Root-Terms</i>? They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli4' href='#pts-vp-pli4'>PTS vp Pli 4</a> Ignorance;</li>
<li>Craving,</li>
<li>Greed,</li>
<li>Hate,</li>
<li>Delusion;</li>
<li>Perception of Beauty,</li>
<li>Perception of Pleasure,</li>
<li>Perception of Permanence,</li>
<li>Perception of Self;</li>
<li>Quiet,</li>
<li>Insight;</li>
<li>Non-Greed,</li>
<li>Non-Hate,</li>
<li>Non-Delusion;</li>
<li>Perception of Ugliness,</li>
<li>Perception of Pain,</li>
<li>Perception of Impermanence,</li>
<li>Perception of Not-Self.</li>
</ul>
<p> These are the eighteen Root-Terms.</p>
<p>Herein, nine terms are unprofitable, wherein all unprofit is collated <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en5' href='#pts-vp-en5'>PTS vp En 5</a> and nine terms are profitable, wherein all profit is collated.</p>
<p>What are the nine unprofitable terms, wherein all unprofit is collated? <i>Ignorance</i> … down to <i>Perception of Self</i>: these are the nine unprofitable terms, wherein all unprofit is collated.</p>
<p>What are the nine profitable terms, wherein all profit is collated? <i>Quiet</i> … down to <i>Perception of Not-Self</i>: these are the nine profitable terms, wherein all profit is collated.</p>
<p>These are the eighteen Root-Terms. Here is a mnemonic verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The nine terms, Craving, Ignorance,<br>
And Greed, Hate, and Delusion too,<br>
And with as well Perversions four,<br>
Do constitute defilement's plane.<br>
The nine terms, Mindfulness-Foundations,<br>
And Quiet and Insight, and the Roots<br>
Of Profit: all this profit <span class='add'>[here]</span><br>
Does constitute the faculties' plane.<br>
All profit by nine terms construed,<br>
And all unprofit too by nine:<br>
With nine Root-Terms for each of these,<br>
Both <span class='add'>[sides thus total]</span> eighteen terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>12. Of these eighteen Root-Terms, the nine unprofitable terms are the Origin of Suffering, while the profitable terms are the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering. And accordingly, the fruit of the Origin is Suffering, while the fruit of the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering is Cessation. <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli5' href='#pts-vp-pli5'>PTS vp Pli 5</a> These are the four noble Truths, which were taught by the Blessed One at Benares.</p>
<p>13. Herein, while the letters, the terms, the phrases, the moods,  the language, and the demonstrations, of the Noble Truth of Suffering, are of ungauged measure, they are taught nevertheless by an explaining, displaying, divulging, analysing, exhibiting, and describing, of that very meaning. And so of all the Truths.</p>
<p>14. Accordingly each one of the Truths must be searched as to its letters, terms, phrases, moods, language, and demonstrations, of ungauged measure: the phrasing for variety of meaning, and also <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en6' href='#pts-vp-en6'>PTS vp En 6</a> the meaning for variety of phrasing. For (<i>were any monk or divine to say thus “Having rejected this Suffering, I shall describe another Suffering, that would have but his words for basis, and were he questioned, he could never substantiate it</i>”). Such are the Truths.</p>
<p>15. And whatever Thread, Song, Prose-Exposition, Verse, Exclamation, Saying, Birth-Story, Marvellous-Idea, or Question-and-Answer, was uttered by the Blessed One between the night of his finding full enlightenment and the night of his attaining complete extinction is all the Wheel (Blessing) of the True Idea set rolling (made to occur) <span class='add'>[by him]</span>. Nor is there anything whatever of the teaching of the Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, that is outside the Wheel (Blessing) of the True Idea. The whole of that Thread must be sought among the Noble Ideas. Herein, in the discerning <span class='add'>[of the four Truths]</span> there is the pentad ending with “light”.</p>
<p>These four Noble Truths in detail are as follows.</p>

After finding the way of entry as to the penetration <span class='add'>[of them]</span> and as to the characteristic <span class='add'>[of each]</span> by means of these shared Threads according as they are presented <span class='add'>[in the Threads cited]</span>, other Threads can be demonstrated provided one does not misapply <span class='add'>[them]</span>.</p>
<p>60. Verse should be assessed by verses, prose-exposition by prose-expositions.</p>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en23' href='#pts-vp-en23'>PTS vp En 23</a>61. And these shared <span class='add'>[Threads given above, namely the 6 dyads and 4 triads]</span> are ten <span class='add'>[of the possible twelve]</span> augmentations. This is the miscellaneous demonstration. Then there are also (a) the one shared tetrad-demonstration, and (b) the one <span class='add'>[standing for]</span> an all<span class='add'>[-inclusive demonstration]</span>, as one part <span class='add'>[representing any of]</span> the five <span class='add'>[mentioned above, namely the 4 triads and 1 tetrad]</span> with the six <span class='add'>[dyads]</span> too. These two augmentations (?) and the previous ten <span class='add'>[make up]</span> the twelve Truth-augmentations.</p>
<p>62. Up to this point, however, there has been <span class='add'>[actually]</span> no all<span class='add'>[-inclusive]</span> Thread <span class='add'>[quoted]</span>. By one who is diligent that—either prose-exposition or verse—can after searching be demonstrated without using the way of entry by these twelve augmentations. Here is a brief <span class='add'>[demonstration]</span>.</p>
<p>63. <span class='add'>[A]</span> All <i>Suffering</i> meets together under seven terms. What seven? All Suffering can be demonstrated by the following terms: (1) <i>association with the loathed</i> and (2) <i>dissociation from the loved</i>; for that the two supports are the body and cognizance, hence it is called (3) (<i>bodily suffering</i> and (4) <i>mental</i> <span class='add'>[suffering]</span>), and there is no suffering (pain) that is neither bodily nor mental; <span class='add'>[so]</span> all suffering can be demonstrated by the two terms “bodily” and “mental”. It is also comprised by (5) <i>painfulness as pain</i>, (6) <i>painfulness in determinations</i>, and (7) <i>painfulness in change</i>; so this suffering is all comprised also by these three terms. Accordingly this threefold suffering, and the twofold suffering as bodily and mental, and the twofold suffering <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en24' href='#pts-vp-en24'>PTS vp En 24</a> as association-with-the-loathed and dissociation-from-the-loved <span class='add'>[make up]</span> the sevenfold suffering.</p>
<p>64. <span class='add'>[B]</span> Herein <span class='add'>[all]</span> <i>Origin</i> is threefold, without fourth, without fifth. How threefold? Craving, view, and action.</p>
<p>65. Herein, while craving is the origin of being, it is action that is the origin of the inferiority or superiority of one thus generated. So any inferiority and superiority in the <span class='add'>[various]</span> kinds of being <span class='add'>[existence]</span> and destinations is comprised by the three kinds of painfulness, and also the body with its consciousness <span class='add'>[belonging]</span> to one shut in by ignorance and fettered by craving for being, which body having been procured owing to the two roots <span class='add'>[craving and ignorance]</span>, is comprised by the three painfulnesses too.</p>
<p>66. Likewise, view can be arrived at from perversion. That can be demonstrated as sevenfold: the single perverting is demonstrated as <span class='add'>[occurring through]</span> the three <span class='add'>[Things perverted]</span> and having four objects of perversion.</p>
<p>Herein, what is the single perverting? It is distorted apprehension, way of entry by rejection <span class='add'>[of the fact]</span>, such that it apprehends distortedly that there is permanence in the impermanent, and so <span class='add'>[with the rest of]</span> the four perversions. While this <span class='add'>[perverting]</span> is one, what is perverted is perception, cognizance, and view.</p>
<p>What are the four objects of perversion? <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli21' href='#pts-vp-pli21'>PTS vp Pli 21</a> They are the body, feeling, cognizance, and ideas.</p>
<p>67. When someone goes by the perversions thus his unprofitable <span class='add'>[cognizance]</span> increases. Herein, the perversion of perception increases the unprofitable root hate, the perversion of cognizance increases the unprofitable root greed, and the perversion of view increases the unprofitable root delusion.</p>
<p>68. Herein, the fruit of the unprofitable root hate is the three wrongnesses, namely wrong speech, wrong action, and wrong livelihood; the fruit of the unprofitable root greed is the three wrongnesses, namely wrong intention, wrong effort, and wrong concentration; the fruit of the unprofitable root delusion is the two wrongnesses, namely wrong view and wrong mindfulness.</p>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en25' href='#pts-vp-en25'>PTS vp En 25</a>69. Thus this unprofitable <span class='add'>[cognizance]</span> has cause and has condition: the perversions are the condition and the unprofitable roots are the cause.</p>
<p>70. And these same <span class='add'>[perversion and root]</span> in their opposite, neither less nor more, can be demonstrated as the two conditions in the case of <span class='add'>[C]</span> <i>Cessation</i> and in the case of <span class='add'>[D]</span> the <i>Path</i>; <span class='add'>[but the conditions are]</span> four as well by assuming perversion in the opposite.</p>
<p>71. Here is a mnemonic verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>By ignorance is the world shut in,<br>
And fetters <span class='add'>[in]</span> the Citta <span class='add'>[Thread]</span>;<br>
