<h3>Demonstration in Combination with Person-Types</h3>
<p>573.<a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli141' href='#pts-vp-pli141'>PTS vp Pli 141</a> Meditation is fading <span class='add'>[of lust]</span>. The four meditations can be cited in detail.</p>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en189' href='#pts-vp-en189'>PTS vp En 189</a>574. They are of two kinds: dissociated from enlightenment factors and associated with enlightenment factors. Herein, those dissociated from enlightenment factors belong to those outside <span class='add'>[the Enlightened Ones' dispensation]</span> while those associated with enlightenment factors belong to persons ennobled <span class='add'>[by obtainment of the Eight-Factored Path]</span>.</p>
<p>575. Herein, there are these six personal roots <span class='add'>[namely lust and the rest]</span>. By presenting them as <span class='add'>[in]</span> one (1) of lusting temperament, (2) of hating temperament, (3) of deluded temperament, (4) of lusting-hating temperament, (5) of lusting-deluded temperament,  (6) of hating-deluded temperament, and (7) of lust-hate-and-delusion-tending-to-be-quieted temperament, there are thus these <span class='add'>[seven]</span> types of persons who have the five hindrances to their entry upon meditation. The opposite, according to capacity to resist them, counteracts the three roots of unprofit <span class='add'>[as follows]</span>: by means of the profitable root non-greed it counteracts covetousness and agitation and drifting-about, which are due to the unprofitable root greed; worry and uncertainty are on the side of delusion, and it counteracts that by means of non-delusion: hate and lethargy-and-drowsiness are on the side of hate, and it counteracts that by means of non-hate.</p>
<h3>4 Meditations—Word-Commentary 1st Meditation</h3>
<p>576. Herein, for the fulfilling of non-greed he thinks renunciation-thinking. Herein, for the fulfilling of non-hate he thinks non-ill-will-thinking. Herein, for the fulfilling of non-delusion he thinks non-cruelty-thinking.</p>
<p>577. Herein, for the fulfilling of non-greed he is (secluded from sensual desires). Herein, for the fulfilling of non-hate and <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en190' href='#pts-vp-en190'>PTS vp En 190</a> for the fulfilling of non-delusion he is (<i>secluded from unprofitable ideas</i>). <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli142' href='#pts-vp-pli142'>PTS vp Pli 142</a> And so (<i>he enters upon and abides in the first meditation, which is accompanied by thinking and exploring, with happiness and pleasure born of seclusion</i>).</p>
<p>578. “Thinking”: there are three kinds of thinking, namely renunciation-thinking, non-ill-will-thinking, and non-cruelty-thinking.</p>
<p>579. Herein, “thinking” is the first instance while “exploring” is the exploration of what is got thus.</p>
<p>580. Just as, when a man sees a man coming in the distance he does not yet know whether it is a woman or a man; but when he has got <span class='add'>[the perception]</span> that “it is a woman” or that “it is a man” or that “it is one of such colour (caste)” or that “it is one of such shape (figure)”, then when he is <i>thinking</i> <span class='add'>[this]</span> he further scrutinizes <span class='add'>[as follows]</span> “How then, is he virtuous or unvirtuous, rich or poor”?, such is <i>exploring</i>. In <i>thinking</i> he fixes, in <i>exploring</i> he wanders about <span class='add'>[his fixed object]</span> and turns <span class='add'>[it]</span> over.</p>
<p>581. And just as a winged bird first accumulates <span class='add'>[speed]</span> and afterwards no more accumulates <span class='add'>[speed, when gliding]</span>, so too, thinking is like the accumulation <span class='add'>[of speed]</span>, and like the out-stretchedness of the <span class='add'>[gliding bird's]</span> wings is exploring, <span class='add'>[which]</span> keeps preserving the thinkings and keeps preserving the explorings.</p>
<p>582. <span class='add'>[Such]</span> thinking is the opposite of perception of sensual desires; <span class='add'>[such]</span> exploring is the opposite of perception of ill will and of perception of cruelty. The action of <span class='add'>[such]</span> kinds of thinking is <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en191' href='#pts-vp-en191'>PTS vp En 191</a> non-attention to the unprofitable. The action of <span class='add'>[such]</span> kinds of exploring is the restraining of the “forerunners”.</p>
<p>583. Thinking is like a text-reciter who does his recital silently: exploring is like his simply contemplating it. Thinking is like non-diagnosis; exploring is like diagnosis. Thinking is the Discrimination of Language and the Discrimination of Perspicuity; exploring is the Discrimination of Ideas and the Discrimination of Meanings. Thinking is cognizance's skill in health; exploring is cognizance's skill in directive-guidance. <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli143' href='#pts-vp-pli143'>PTS vp Pli 143</a> Thinking is about this being profitable, this unprofitable, about this to be kept in being, this to be abandoned, this to be verified; exploring is like the abandoning, the keeping in being, the verifying.</p>
<p>584. The twofold, bodily and mental, pain does not arise in one steadied in these types of (a) <i>thinking</i> and (b) <i>exploring</i>, and the twofold pleasure, bodily and mental, does arise. The mental pleasure thus sprung from thinking is (c) <i>happiness</i>, while (d) the bodily <i>pleasure</i> is bodily feeling (?). The (e) <i>unification</i> here is concentration. That is how the first meditation has abandoned five factors and possesses five factors.</p>
<h3>2nd Meditation</h3>
<p>585. With constant cultivation of this same thinking and exploring his mentality becomes inclined thereto. Then the thinking and exploring seem gross to him, and the renunciation-born pleasure-of-happiness also is gross, and so concentration-born (c) <i>happiness</i> and (d) <i>delight</i> are born instead.</p>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en192' href='#pts-vp-en192'>PTS vp En 192</a>586. His heart <span class='add'>[which in the first meditation]</span> had exploring's object becomes (f) <i>confident</i> (clarified) in itself with the pacification of these <span class='add'>[namely thinking and exploring]</span>. The two ideas, namely thinking and exploring, need no longer be recollected, and what now can be served is the presently arisen singleness due to their quieting, which singleness is (e) <i>unification</i>. It is through that singleness that the (c) <i>happiness</i> comes to fulfilment. The happiness is the <span class='add'>[mental]</span> joy faculty, while the (d) <i>pleasure</i> is the <span class='add'>[bodily]</span> pleasure faculty, the unification of cognizance is concentration. So that second meditation possesses four factors.</p>
<h3>3rd Meditation</h3>
<p>587. (<i>With the fading … of happiness, he …</i>) has abandoned what is comprised by wetness. But joy-cognizance still arises there, and when he investigates that, he attends with only <span class='add'>[conascent]</span> onlooking-equanimity: (<i>With the fading … of happiness he abides in onlooking-equanimity</i>); and as he <span class='add'>[still]</span> feels with the body the (d) <i>pleasure</i> induced by the happiness he abides aware, by means of which (g) <i>mindfulness</i> and (h) <i>awareness</i> the (i) <i>onlooking-equanimity</i> comes to fulfilment. <span class='add'>[And the (e) unification of cognizance is concentration. So]</span> that third meditation possesses five factors.</p>
<h3>4th Meditation</h3>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en193' href='#pts-vp-en193'>PTS vp En 193</a>588.<a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli144' href='#pts-vp-pli144'>PTS vp Pli 144</a> Likewise (<i>with the abandoning of bodily pleasure</i>): in the first meditation the grief faculty ceases, and in the second meditation the pain faculty ceases, so  (<i>with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in the fourth meditation, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure, and the purity of whose mindfulness is due to onlooking-equanimity</i>). Herein, the onlooking-equanimity was as yet unclarified owing to the <span class='add'>[presence of the]</span> four faculties, namely the pain faculty, grief faculty, pleasure faculty, and joy faculty. With the cessation of these there is onlooking-equanimity and awareness. Herein, it was owing to the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty that there was unmindfulness,  and with their cessation he becomes possessed of mindfulness; and it is owing to the pain faculty and the grief faculty that there was unawareness, and with their cessation he becomes aware. So with the clarification (?) due to (i) <i>onlooking-equanimity</i>, <span class='add'>[which is accompanied by (k) <i>neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling</i>,]</span> he becomes (j) <i>mindful</i> and aware, and there is (e) <i>unification</i> of cognizance. This is called the fourth meditation.</p>
<h3>The 7 Person-Types again</h3>
<p>589. Herein, (1) the person of lusting temperament has the pleasure faculty and the joy faculty. (2) The person of hating temperament has the pain faculty and the grief faculty. (3) The person of deluded temperament has unmindfulness and unawareness.</p>
<p>Herein, the lusting-temperament person's approval ceases in the third meditation and in the fourth. The hating-temperament person's resistance ceases in the first meditation and in the second. The deluded-temperament person's unawareness ceases in the first meditation and in the second while his unmindfulness ceases in the third meditation and in the fourth. That is how these three types of persons' four meditations arrive at their cleansing.</p>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en194' href='#pts-vp-en194'>PTS vp En 194</a>590. Herein, (4) the person of lusting-hating temperament has <span class='add'>[unmindfulness and unawareness]</span> and approval and resistance, hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminution.</p>
<p>591.<a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli145' href='#pts-vp-pli145'>PTS vp Pli 145</a> Herein, (5) the person of lusting-deluded temperament has the trio with approval, <span class='add'>[and he is one who sees gratification; hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminution.</span></p>
<p>592. <span class='add'>Herein, (6) the person of hating-deluded temperament has the trio with resistance,]</span> and he is one who sees disappointment; hence his meditation is of the kind dealing with diminution.</p>
<p>593. Herein, (7) It is the person of lusting-hate-and-delusion-tending-to-be-quieted temperament <span class='add'>[ … (?)]</span> who has the kind of meditation that deals with distinction.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[That is how]</span> these four meditations can be demonstrated among these seven types of persons.</p>
<h3>Combinations with various ideas</h3>
<p>594. Also as regards the four kinds of concentration <span class='add'>[in the four bases for success]</span>: the first meditation is through concentration due to <i>will</i>, the second meditation is through concentration due to <i>energy</i>, the third meditation is through concentration due to <i>cognizance</i>, and the fourth meditation is through concentration due to <i>inquiry</i>.</p>
<p><a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en195' href='#pts-vp-en195'>PTS vp En 195</a>595. <span class='add'>[Again]</span> the first meditation is through the Dispositionless, the second meditation is through the Void, the third meditation is through the Signless, and the fourth meditation is through Mindfulness of Breathing.</p>
<p>596. <span class='add'>[Again]</span> the first meditation is through the pacification of sensual-desire thinking and ill-will (thinking), the second meditation is through the pacification of thinking and exploring, the third meditation is through the pacification of the pleasure faculty and the grief faculty, and the fourth meditation is through the pacification of the bodily determinations, <span class='add'>[namely in-breath and out-breath.]</span></p>
<p>597. <span class='add'>[Again]</span> the first meditation is through the Expression of Generosity, the second meditation is through the Expression of Truth, the third meditation is through the Expression of Understanding, and the fourth meditation is through the Expression of Peace.</p>
<p>598. These four meditations are <span class='add'>[now]</span> demonstrated by a brief demonstration.</p>
<p>599. It is here that the concentration faculty comes to fulfilment,  the other four <span class='add'>[faculties there]</span> being subordinate to it.</p>
<p>Herein, he who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the first meditation <span class='add'>[has gone]</span> by the painful Way with sluggish acquaintance, with the grief faculty in opposition. He who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the second meditation <span class='add'>[has gone]</span> by the painful Way with swift acquaintance, with the pain faculty in Opposition. He who reaches exhaustion by depending on the third meditation <span class='add'>[has gone]</span> by the pleasant Way with sluggish acquaintance, with the joy faculty in opposition. He who reaches exhaustion of taints by depending on the fourth meditation <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-pli146' href='#pts-vp-pli146'>PTS vp Pli 146</a> <a class='pts' id='pts-vp-en196' href='#pts-vp-en196'>PTS vp En 196</a> has gone by the pleasant Way with swift acquaintance, with the pleasure faculty in opposition.</p>
