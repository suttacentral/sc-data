“I am not able to cross over the great flood.<br>
Please tell me of a support, All-Seeing Visionary,<br>
depending on which I can cross over this flood.”</p>

“depending on nothing, cross over the flood.<br>
Having given up sense pleasures, abstaining from talk,<br>
day and night you must look for the end of suffering.”</p>

“who is depending on nothingness, having given up all else,<br>
intent on the highest freedom which still has perception—<br>
will he remain there without going away?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1079'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.97'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1072'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.7.4'></a>“He who is passionless regarding all sense pleasures, Upasīva,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“who is depending on nothingness, having given up all else,intent on the highest freedom which still has perception—<br>
he will remain there without going away.”</p>

for a great number of years, All-Seeing Visionary,<br>
will he become cool and free right there,<br>
or will the consciousness of such a one fall away?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1081'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.99'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1074'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.7.6'></a>“As a flame overthrown by the force of the wind, Upasīva,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“goes to rest and can no longer be discerned,<br>
just so the Sage free from the mental body<br>
goes to rest and can no longer be discerned.”</p>

“or is he actually eternally healthy?<br>
Please explain this to me, O Sage,<br>
for this Teaching has been understood by you.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1083'></a><a class='svv' id='svv5.101'></a><a class='vnp' id='vnp1076'></a><a class='svsv' id='svsv5.7.8'></a>“There is no measure of the one who has come to rest, Upasīva,” said the Gracious One,<br>
“there is nothing by which they can speak of him,<br>
when everything has been completely removed,<br>
all the pathways for speech are also completely removed.”</p>
