<h1>The Discourse on Friendliness Meditation</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>What should be done by one skilful in good, who has comprehended the state of peace:<br>
he ought to be able, straight, and upright, easy to speak to, meek, without conceit,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>satisfied <span class='add'>with little</span>, easy to support, free from duties, and light in living,<br>
with faculties at peace, prudent, not forward, and greedless among the families,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault <span class='add'>with him</span>.<br>
“<span class='add'>May all beings</span> be happy and secure, may all beings in their hearts be happy!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>Whatsoever breathing beings there are—trembling, firm, or any other <span class='add'>beings</span>,<br>
whether they be long or great, of middle size, short, tiny, or of compact <span class='add'>body</span>,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>those who are seen, and those who are unseen, those who live far away, those who are near,<br>
those who are born, and those who still seek birth—may all beings in their hearts be happy!”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>No one should cheat another, nor should he despise anyone wherever they be,<br>
he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>In the same way as a mother would protect her son, her only son, with her life,<br>
so toward all beings he should develop the measureless thought <span class='add'>of friendliness</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>Towards the whole wide world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness,<br>
above, below, and across <span class='add'>the middle</span>, without barriers, hate, or enemy.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a>Standing, walking, sitting, lying, for as long as he is without torpor,<br>
he should be resolved on this mindfulness, for this, they say here, is the <span class='add'>true</span> spiritual life.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a>Without going back to <span class='add'>wrong</span> views, virtuous, and endowed with <span class='add'>true</span> insight,<br>
having removed <span class='add'>all</span> greed for sense pleasures, he will never come to lie in a womb again.</p>
