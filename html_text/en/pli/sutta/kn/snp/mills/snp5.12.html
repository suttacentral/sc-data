I’ve heard of the heroic one<br>
from desires free for pleasures sensuous,<br>
with Question I come for the flood-crosser,<br>
from desire free<br>
O Lord with Eye innate, tell me the Peaceful State—<br>
how truly it is, tell me of this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1104'></a>The Lord comports himself as the senses’ conqueror<br>
as the hot sun the earth by its heat,<br>
of small wit am I, Thou of wisdom great,<br>
explain to me Dharma that I may understand.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1105'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The abandonment here of birth and old age,<br>
greed for sensual pleasures curb,<br>
and safety see in letting-go,<br>
let there not be found in you<br>
grasping or rejection.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1106'></a>Dry up whatever’s gone “before”,<br>
while “after” have no thing at all;<br>
if in the “middle” you don’t grasp,<br>
you’ll fare in Perfect Peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1107'></a>O brahmin, from greediness free<br>
for every sort of name-and-form,<br>
the inﬂows are not found by which<br>
one’d go beneath death’s sway.</p>
