<h1>5.7. Upasīva’s Questions</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1076'></a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
Alone, O Sakya, unsupported too,<br>
the mighty flood I do not dare to cross,<br>
All-seeing One, please tell me of the means<br>
using which I may overpass the flood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1077'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Mindfully do you no-thingness regard,<br>
rely on “there-is-not” to go across the flood,<br>
abandon conversation, let go of sense-desires,<br>
See craving’s exhaustion by night and by day.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1078'></a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
That one who’s unattached to sense-desires,<br>
relying on no-thingness, left others aside,<br>
freed in the highest of consciousness’s freedom,<br>
will that one be established, or fall away from this?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1079'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
That one who’s unattached to sense-desires,<br>
relying on no-thingness, left others aside,<br>
freed in the highest of consciousness’s freedom,<br>
that one will be established, not fall away from this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1080'></a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
Should that one remain even for a heap of years,<br>
O all-Seeing One, but still not fall away?<br>
Would that one liberated cool-become just there,<br>
consciousness ceased in that very state?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1081'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
As flame blown out by force of wind<br>
has gone to its “goal”, cannot be described,<br>
likewise the Sage “in mind and body” freed:<br>
gone to the Goal and cannot be described.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1082'></a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
Does one not exist who’s reached the Goal?<br>
Or does one dwell forever free?<br>
O Sage, do well declare this to me now,<br>
for certainly this dharma’s known by you.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1083'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Of one who’s reached the Goal, no measure’s found,<br>
there is not that by which one could be named,<br>
when dharmas for that one are emptied out,<br>
emptied are the ways of telling too.</p>
