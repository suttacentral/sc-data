<h1>5.15. Posāla’s Question</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1119'></a><span class='speaker'>Posāla</span><br>
To One illuming the past,<br>
the undisturbed who’s cut off doubt,<br>
Gone across the dharmas all,<br>
with this question have I come:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1120'></a>In whom are no perceptions of form,<br>
abandoned it in bodies all,<br>
who sees within, without “there’s nought”,<br>
of such a one, what knowledge known<br>
how will such a one be led?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1121'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The Tathāgata knows thoroughly<br>
all supports of consciousness:<br>
knows this one as stuck,<br>
that one freed, or bound for the beyond.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1122'></a>Having known the existence of no-thingness<br>
together with its bond of indulgence,<br>
then investigating this and seeing that,<br>
just this is the knowledge of a brahmin perfected.</p>
