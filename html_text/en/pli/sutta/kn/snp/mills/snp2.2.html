<h1>2.2. Food and the True Meaning of “Stench”</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns242'></a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
Wild millet, grains of grass and pulse,<br>
young shoots and roots and jungle fruits—<br>
Dharma-gained and by the Peaceful eaten,<br>
they who speak no lies desiring sensual pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns243'></a>But who, eating food that’s well-prepared and cooked<br>
of Sālī-rice, all other things to eat,<br>
delicious, by others donated specially<br>
that one, O Kassapa, is like a carrion-stench.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns244'></a>“No carrion-stench is mine”, you say like this,<br>
that it does not apply to you, O Brahma-kin—<br>
while eating <i>sālī</i>-rice, all other things<br>
with flesh of fowls so very well prepared;<br>
the meaning of this, O Kassapa, I ask:<br>
Your food, what sort of carrion-stench it has?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns245'></a><span class='speaker'>Answer</span><br>
Taking life, torture, mutilation too,<br>
binding, stealing, telling lies, and fraud;<br>
deceit, adultery, and studying crooked views:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns246'></a>Those people of desires and pleasures unrestrained,<br>
greedy for tastes with impurity mixed in,<br>
of nihilistic views, unstable, hard to train:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns247'></a>The rough, the cruel, backbiters and betrayers,<br>
those void of compassion, extremely arrogant,<br>
the miserly, to others never giving anything:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns248'></a>Who’s angry, obstinate, hostile and vain,<br>
deceitful, envious, a boastful person too,<br>
full of oneself, with the wicked intimate:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns249'></a>Those of evil ways, defaulters on debts,<br>
imposters, slanderers, deceitful in their dealings,<br>
vile men who commit evil deeds in this world:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns250'></a>Those people unrestrained for living beings here,<br>
taking others’ property, on injury intent,<br>
immoral, harsh and cruel, for others no respect:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns251'></a>Towards others greedy or hateful—they attack them,<br>
ever on misdemeanours bent,<br>
they go to darkness after death;<br>
such beings as this fall headlong into Hell:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns252'></a>Not from fish and flesh tasting and not by nudity,<br>
not by the plucking of head-hairs,<br>
nor growing of matted locks,<br>
not by the smearing of the ashes of the dead,<br>
not wearing abrasive skins,<br>
not following sacrificial fires,<br>
or worldly austerities for gaining immortality,<br>
nor mantras, nor offerings,<br>
oblations, seasons’ services<br>
can purify a mortal still overcome by doubt.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns253'></a>Who lives with sense-streams guarded, well-aware,<br>
in the Dharma firm, enjoying gently rectitude,<br>
beyond attachments gone, all <i>dukkha</i> left behind,<br>
that wise one’s unsullied by the seen and the heard.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns254'></a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Again, again the Radiant One this topic taught<br>
to that knower of the Vedas, in those mantras expert,<br>
thus clarified the Sage in verses sweetly-sounding.<br>
Him of no carrion-stench, free who’s hard to trace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns255'></a>Having listened to these verses well-spoken by the Buddha,<br>
free of such stench, all <i>dukkhas</i> dispelling,<br>
he of humble heart bowed at the Tathāgata’s feet<br>
and there and then requested his own Leaving-home.</p>
