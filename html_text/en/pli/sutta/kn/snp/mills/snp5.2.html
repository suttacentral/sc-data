<h1>5.2. Ajita’s Questions</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1039'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
The world, by what it’s wrapped?<br>
and why it shines not forth?<br>
say too with what it’s smeared?<br>
and what’s its greatest fear?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1040'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The world is wrapped by Ignorance;<br>
It shines not forth due to doubt and negligence;<br>
Its smeared by longing,<br>
And suffering is its greatest fear.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1041'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
The streams are flowing everywhere,<br>
how can the streams be blocked,<br>
say how the streams may be restrained?<br>
by what the streams are dammed?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1042'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Whatever streams are in the world,<br>
they may be blocked by mindfulness—<br>
that I say is streams’ restraint;<br>
by wisdom they are dammed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1043'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
So wisdom it is and mindfulness!<br>
Now, sir, I ask you, tell me this:<br>
the namer-mind, the bodily form—<br>
where does it cease to be?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1044'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
That question asked by you<br>
I tell about it now,<br>
the namer-mind and bodily form<br>
where they cease to be:<br>
by cessation of the consciousness,<br>
they wholly cease to be.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1045'></a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
Who have the Dharma measured up,<br>
who train themselves, the multitude,<br>
how, sir, do they behave themselves?<br>
please answer what I speak.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1046'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
No greediness in pleasures of sense,<br>
having a tranquil mind and clear,<br>
skilled in all the Dharma’s ways—<br>
that mindful bhikkhu who’s left home.</p>
