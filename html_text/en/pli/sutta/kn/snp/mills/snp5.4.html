I have come with a question for you,<br>
The immovable, seer of the root;<br>
Subject to what do the sages, people,<br>
Nobles, and brahmins offer many kinds of sacrifices<br>
To gods here in the world?<br>
Lord Buddha, please tell me this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1051'>SC Verse 1051</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1051'>SC Verse 1051</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Whatever sages, people,<br>
Nobles, and brahmins offer many kinds of sacrifices<br>
To gods here in the world,<br>
Do so wishing to be reborn, Puṇṇaka;<br>
Subject to old age they offer their sacrfices.</p>

Whatever sages, people,<br>
Nobles, and brahmins offer many kinds of sacrifices<br>
To gods here in the world,<br>
Did they, diligently following the way of sacrifice,<br>
Cross over birth and old age, sir?<br>
Lord Buddha, please tell me this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1053'>SC Verse 1053</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1053'>SC Verse 1053</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Hoping, praying, longing, and sacrificing,<br>
Longing for sensual pleasures<br>
That are dependent on getting things;<br>
I declare that they, devoted to sacrifice<br>
And besotted by rebirth,<br>
Did not cross over birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1054'>SC Verse 1054</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1054'>SC Verse 1054</a><span class='speaker'>Puṇṇaka</span><br>
If, sir, those devoted to sacrifice<br>
Did not thereby cross over birth and old age,<br>
Then who in the world of gods and men<br>
Has crossed over birth and old age?<br>
Lord Buddha, please tell me this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1055'>SC Verse 1055</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1055'>SC Verse 1055</a><span class='speaker'>Puṇṇaka</span><br>
Having scrutinized the world near and far,<br>
One who has no disturbances at all in the world,<br>
Peaceful, clear, without affliction or desire,<br>
Such a one has crossed over<br>
Birth and old age, I declare.</p>
