<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1056'></a><span class='speaker'>Mettagū</span><br>
Reached Vedas’ end, I deem, developed yourself,<br>
so I ask the Lord thus, please tell me of this:<br>
how then have resulted these various <i>dukkhas</i><br>
of various forms found in the world?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1057'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
On <i>dukkha’s</i> arising you’ve asked me indeed,<br>
so as I have Known, I impart it to you:<br>
The diverse-formed <i>dukkhas</i> come to exist<br>
from attachments to asset of whatever kind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1058'></a>That ignorant one attached indeed to assets,<br>
stupidly reaches to <i>dukkha</i> repeatedly,<br>
therefore that one in seeing <i>dukkha’s</i> birth and arising,<br>
such attached-to assets should not be created.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1059'></a><span class='speaker'>Mettagū</span><br>
Whatever we asked, to us you explained,<br>
another thing I ask, please speak upon that:<br>
how do the wise ones cross over the flood<br>
of birth and decay, lamentation and grief?<br>
O Sage, do well declare this to me now,<br>
for certainly this dharma has been known by you.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1060'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
This Dharma I’ll explain to you,<br>
Seen-now and not traditional law,<br>
knowing which the mindful fare,<br>
and cross the world’s entanglements.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1061'></a><span class='speaker'>Mettagū</span><br>
I am delighted, Seeker Great,<br>
with this Dharma ultimate,<br>
knowing which the mindful fare,<br>
and cross the world’s entanglements.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1062'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Whatever you cognize above,<br>
below, across and in between,<br>
consciously dispel delight in them,<br>
and settling-down—in “being” you’ll not stand.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1063'></a>Mindfully who live like this, aware,<br>
such bhikkhus, let go of “making-mine”<br>
with birth and decay, lamenting and grief:<br>
just here do the wise all <i>dukkha</i> let go.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1064'></a><span class='speaker'>Mettagū</span><br>
With the Great Seeker’s speech I am overjoyed,<br>
well explained, O Gotama, is “assets unattached”,<br>
for surely the Lord all <i>dukkha</i> has let go,<br>
for certainly this Dharma has been Known by you.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1065'></a>Those who the Sage always advises,<br>
surely they’re able to let go of <i>dukkha</i>,<br>
to the Nāga drawn near, to you I bow down;<br>
maybe the Lord will advise me as well.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1066'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Knowing well that brahmin true to Love’s end<span class='footnote-anchor'>*<span class='footnote'>Sujato: The term translated by <abbr>lkm</abbr> in this and the next verse as “love’s end” is <i>vedagū</i>. This is a Brahmanical term referring to one accomplished in the three Vedas, and interpreted by the Buddha as one perfected in liberating knowledge. Perhaps <abbr>lkm</abbr> renders <i>veda</i> as “love” rather than “knowledge” due to the speaker’s name, <i>mettagū</i>. In some cases <i>veda</i> and its derivates, such as <i>vedanā</i>, extend in meaning to “emotion”.</span></span> reached,<br>
having nought and unattached to sensual being,<br>
for certain that one this flood has overcrossed,<br>
crossed to the Far Shore, free of doubts and harshness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1067'></a>This is one who Knows, reached Love’s end just here,<br>
cut bondage to any being, either high or low,<br>
free from craving and desire, free from distress,<br>
I say such one’s crossed over birth and decay.</p>
