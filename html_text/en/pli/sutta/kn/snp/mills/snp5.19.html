“Going to the Further Shore”, I’ll chant—<br>
As He had Seen so did He teach,<br>
that pure One of wisdom profound,<br>
rid of desire and (interior) jungle—<br>
falsehood—for what reason would he speak?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1139'></a>Now therefore I shall eulogize<br>
those words profoundly beautiful,<br>
of One who has renounced the stains<br>
of delusion, pride, hypocrisy.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1140'></a>All-seer, Awake, Dispeller of dark,<br>
beyond all being gone, gone to world’s end,<br>
with no inﬂows left, let go of all <i>dukkha</i>-causes,<br>
that one is “brahmin” rightly named: him do I serve.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1141'></a>As bird that leaves behind a copse,<br>
might then in fruit-filled forest live,<br>
so have I left those of wisdom lean,<br>
as swan to a great lake arrived.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1142'></a>Those who explained to me before,<br>
I heard the Buddha’s utterance,<br>
said “thus it was”, “thus will be”—<br>
all that was only oral lore,<br>
all that promoted more disputes.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1143'></a>Dispeller of darkness, seated alone,<br>
the well-born, him the maker of Light,<br>
Gotama, him profoundly wise,<br>
Gotama, greatly intelligent—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1144'></a>the Dharma to me he pointed out,<br>
which can be seen right here and now,<br>
by time, not limited at all,<br>
craving’s exhaustion, troubles’ end,<br>
with which naught can compare.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1145'></a><span class='speaker'>Brahmin</span><br>
How can you live apart from him,<br>
Even for a minute, Piṅgiya?<br>
Gotama of such profound wisdom,<br>
Gotama of such profound sagacity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1146'></a>Who pointed out the Dhamma to you,<br>
Apparent in this very life,<br>
The ending of craving, free of distress,<br>
With which naught can compare.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1147'></a><span class='speaker'>Piṅgiya</span><br>
I never live apart from him,<br>
Even for a minute, brahmin<br>
Gotama of such profound wisdom,<br>
Gotama of such profound sagacity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1148'></a>Who pointed out the Dhamma to me,<br>
Apparent in this very life,<br>
The ending of craving, free of distress,<br>
With which naught can compare.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1149'></a>I see him with my mind’s eye, brahmin,<br>
Being heedful night and day;<br>
I spend the night revering him,<br>
So I think I am never apart from him.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1150'></a>The mind of faith and rapture, mindfulness,<br>
from Gotama’s teachings never does depart,<br>
for in whoever way the Deeply-Wise One goes,<br>
to that very direction do I bow down.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1151'></a>I am old, my strength is gone,<br>
So my body cannot carry me there.<br>
But my thoughts always travel there,<br>
For my mind, brahmin, is devoted to him.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1152'></a>Floundering in the mud, I lay,<br>
Swimming from island to island,<br>
Then I saw the Awakened Buddha,<br>
Crossed over the flood, free of inflows.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1153'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Just as Vakkali was sure in faith,<br>
Bhadrāvudha, and Āḷavigotama, too,<br>
In the same way, you too should be sure of your faith,<br>
And, Piṅgiya, you will go to the far shore of death.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1154'></a><span class='speaker'>Piṅgiya</span><br>
Thus my inspiration grows even more,<br>
Hearing the voice of the Sage;<br>
The Buddha, who drew back the veil of the world,<br>
Without heartlessness, of inspired speech,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1155'></a>Knows what is beyond the gods,<br>
Knows all, both high and low,<br>
The Teacher who puts and end to questions<br>
Of those who declare their doubts.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1156'></a>The immovable, unshakeable,<br>
That to which there is no compare:<br>
For sure, I will go there,<br>
I have no doubt of that.<br>
You may remember me<br>
As one who’s mind is made up.</p>
