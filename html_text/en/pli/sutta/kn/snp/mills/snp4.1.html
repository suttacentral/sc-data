<h1>4.1. Objects, Desires and Pleasures</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns773'></a>If one with a desiring mind<br>
Succeeds in gaining sensual pleasure,<br>
A mortal such is pleased in mind<br>
With wishes all fulfilled.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns774'></a>But if from this person passionate<br>
all of these pleasures disappear,<br>
then does this pleasure-addict feel,<br>
as though by arrows pierced.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns775'></a>The one who shuns these pleasures of sense,<br>
like treading not on a serpent’s head,<br>
such a one with mindfulness<br>
this tangled world transcends.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns776'></a>Obsessed with fields and property,<br>
with money, estates and those employed,<br>
with many pleasures, women and kin,<br>
such a person greedily—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns777'></a>Do weaknesses bring down indeed,<br>
by dangers is that person crushed,<br>
and then by <i>dukkhas</i> stuck against—<br>
as water into broken boat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns778'></a>So let a mindful one avoid<br>
at every turn these sense-desires,<br>
with them abandoned, cross the flood,<br>
as boat is baled for the Further Shore.</p>
