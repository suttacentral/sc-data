Today’s the lunar fifteenth day—<br>
<i>uposatha</i>—a night divine arrived;<br>
Let’s go to the Teacher Gotama,<br>
him of high repute.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns154'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
Is the mind of such a one<br>
towards all beings well-disposed?<br>
Within his power are his thoughts<br>
towards the wished, the unwished too?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns155'></a><span class='speaker'>Sātāgira</span><br>
Yes, the mind of such a one<br>
towards all beings well-disposed.<br>
Within his power are his thoughts<br>
towards the wished and unwished too.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns156'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
Is he the one who does not steal?<br>
To beings he’s restrained?<br>
Is he far from indolence?<br>
Does <i>jhāna</i> he neglect?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns157'></a><span class='speaker'>Sātāgira</span><br>
He is one who does not steal,<br>
to beings he’s restained.<br>
Buddha’s far from indolence;<br>
<i>jhāna</i> he never neglects.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns158'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
Is he not one who falsely speaks?<br>
Does he use harsh or violent words<br>
or employ slanderous ones?<br>
Or a user of meaningless speech?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns159'></a><span class='speaker'>Sātāgira</span><br>
He’s not one who falsely speaks,<br>
nor uses harsh or violent words;<br>
nor utters words of slander,<br>
but wisdom speaks which benefits.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns160'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
Does he not desire, indulge,<br>
In mind he’s unattached?<br>
Has delusion overcome?<br>
’Mong Dharmas has he Eyes?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns161'></a><span class='speaker'>Sātāgira</span><br>
He does not desire, indulge,<br>
for his mind is unattached.<br>
Delusions all he’s overcome—<br>
’Mong Dharmas, Buddha’s Eyed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns162'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
Has true knowledge he attained?<br>
Is his conduct perfect, pure?<br>
Are his inflows now extinct?<br>
Is he not again to be?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns163'></a><span class='speaker'>Sātāgira</span><br>
Indeed true knowledge he’s attained<br>
and his conduct’s perfect, pure,<br>
for him all inflows are extinct,<br>
so he’ll not again become.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns164'></a>Accomplished is the Sage’s mind,<br>
his actions and his ways of speech,<br>
of true Knowledge and conduct he’s possessed—<br>
rightly he is praised.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns165'></a>Accomplished is the Sage’s mind,<br>
his actions and his ways of speech,<br>
of true Knowledge and conduct he’s possessed—<br>
rightly you rejoice.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns166'></a>Accomplished is the Sage’s mind,<br>
his actions and his ways of speech,<br>
of true Knowledge and conduct he’s possessed—<br>
it’s good that we see Gotama.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns167'></a>Who limbed like antelope and lean,<br>
wise, with no greed and having little food,<br>
Sage in the woods who meditates alone—<br>
let us go see Gotama.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns168'></a>The Great One like a lion who lives alone,<br>
among all pleasures he’s expectation-free,<br>
let us draw near that we may ask of him<br>
how to escape from the snarefulness of death.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns169'></a>O proclaimer of the Dharma, expounding it too,<br>
one who’s beyond all dharmas’ Further Shore,<br>
all fear and hatred you’ve utterly overcome<br>
both of us then of Gotama inquire—</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18'></a><a class='vns' id='vns170'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
What co-arises with the world?<br>
With what’s it make acquaintance?<br>
The world grasps after what indeed?<br>
Why’s the world afflicted?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19'></a><a class='vns' id='vns171'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Six with the world do co-arise,<br>
with six becomes acquainted,<br>
the world’s attached to six indeed,<br>
so, world’s by six afflicted.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20'></a><a class='vns' id='vns172'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
The grasping—what is it then<br>
by which the world’s afflicted?<br>
When asked about this, please do speak:<br>
how to be free from <i>dukkha</i>?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21'></a><a class='vns' id='vns173'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The sensual pleasures five are taught<br>
in the world with mind as six,<br>
having let go of all desire for those,<br>
be thus from <i>dukkha</i> free.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc22'></a><a class='vns' id='vns174'></a>This for the world’s the leading out,<br>
its “as-it-is” declared to you,<br>
and this to you I do declare:<br>
be thus from <i>dukkha</i> free.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc23'></a><a class='vns' id='vns175'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
Here, who goes across the flood,<br>
who goes across the sea,<br>
No standpoint or support,<br>
who in the deep sinks not?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc24'></a><a class='vns' id='vns176'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
That person ever virtuous,<br>
with wisdom, concentrated well,<br>
with mind turned inward, mindful—<br>
crosses the flood that’s hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc25'></a><a class='vns' id='vns177'></a>Detached from thoughts of sense-desire,<br>
all fetters overpassed,<br>
delight-in-being quite destroyed—<br>
who in the deep sinks not.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc26'></a><a class='vns' id='vns178'></a><span class='speaker'>Hemavata</span><br>
Behold the Great Seer of wisdom deep,<br>
of subtle meanings Seer, one owning nought,<br>
unattached to sensual being, free in every way,<br>
proceeding along the pathway of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc27'></a><a class='vns' id='vns179'></a>Behold the Great Seer of perfect repute,<br>
of subtle meanings Seer, of wisdom the imparter,<br>
unattached to the senses’ basis and greatly wise,<br>
all-knower, treading the path of the Noble Ones.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc28'></a><a class='vns' id='vns180'></a>Well-viewed by us today indeed,<br>
well-dawned upon us, well-arisen:<br>
the Awaken One we’ve seen,<br>
crossed the flood, from inflows free.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc29'></a><a class='vns' id='vns181'></a>These ten hundred Yakkhas here<br>
of great power and renown,<br>
all of them for refuge go—<br>
You are our Teacher unexcelled!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc30'></a><a class='vns' id='vns182'></a><span class='speaker'>Both</span><br>
Village to village we shall roam,<br>
mount to mount revering him,<br>
the Fully Awakened One, as well<br>
the Dharmaness of Perfect Dharma.</p>
