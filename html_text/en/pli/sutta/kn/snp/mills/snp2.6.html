<h1>2.6. Wrong Conduct in the Bhikkhu’s Life</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns277'></a>The Good Life living, with Dharma accordingly,<br>
they say that this is wealth supreme.<br>
But if one leaves the household life<br>
gone forth from home to homelessness</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns278'></a>and then be one of those foul-mouthed,<br>
beast-like, delighted doing harm,<br>
such a one’s of evil life<br>
increasing “dust” within himself,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns279'></a>a bhikkhu delighting in quarrelling<br>
while in delusion wrapped,<br>
knows not the Dharma even when<br>
it’s by the Buddha pointed out;</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns280'></a>led along by ignorance so<br>
that one harms those of well-grown mind,<br>
and does not know defilements’ path<br>
that leads to hellish life.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns281'></a>To Downfall going on and on,<br>
from life to life, from dark to dark,<br>
a bhikkhu such as this indeed<br>
hereafter to <i>dukkha</i> descends.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns282'></a>One such with blemishes is like<br>
a public shit-pit filled to the brim,<br>
used for many years,<br>
so very hard to clean.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns283'></a>O bhikkhus, when you come to know<br>
one such attached to household life—<br>
of evil desires and evil thoughts<br>
and of evil ways of behaviour,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns284'></a>all of you united then<br>
should shun, avoid a person such,<br>
blow away these sweepings and<br>
throw away that trash,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns285'></a>and suchlike chaff winnow away—<br>
those sham monks, those conceited monks—<br>
having blown them off, those who are<br>
of evil wants and wrong resorts,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns286'></a>then living in purity with the pure<br>
with mindfulness you will abide,<br>
in concord live, intelligent—<br>
you will arrive at <i>dukkha</i>’s end.</p>
