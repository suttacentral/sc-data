As Craving with Longing and Lust had been Seen<br>
no spark of desire existed for sex,<br>
What then about this filled with piss and with shit—<br>
That even with foot I’d not wish to touch!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns843'>SC Verse 843</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns843'>SC Verse 843</a><span class='speaker'>Māgandiya</span><br>
If you don’t wish for a jewel such as this,<br>
a woman desired by many lords of men,<br>
what view do you hold, living by what rite,<br>
by what vows to arise in what kind of life?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns844'>SC Verse 844</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns844'>SC Verse 844</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
As nothing is grasped among various Dharmas,<br>
so for me there is not any “This I proclaim”,<br>
having seen but not grasped among many views,<br>
through discernment among them I saw inner peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns845'>SC Verse 845</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns845'>SC Verse 845</a><span class='speaker'>Māgandiya</span><br>
Among what’s constructed thoroughly knowing,<br>
Ungrasping, O Sage, do you speak upon these,<br>
“inward peacefulness”—what meaning has that,<br>
how will the wise declare it to be?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns846'>SC Verse 846</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns846'>SC Verse 846</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Neither from views, not from learning or knowledge,<br>
not from rites, or from vows, does purity come I say;<br>
nor from no views, no learning, no knowledge acquired,<br>
no rites and no vows—none of them at all,<br>
Neither by grasping nor giving them up<br>
is their peace unsupported, and no hunger “to be”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns847'>SC Verse 847</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns847'>SC Verse 847</a><span class='speaker'>Māgandiya</span><br>
If you speak then not of purity by views,<br>
not by learning, not by knowledge, not rites and not vows;<br>
nor from no views, no learning, no knowledge acquired,<br>
by no rites and no vows—none of them at all,<br>
then I think that this is very deluded Dharma,<br>
for some depend on views as the source of purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns848'>SC Verse 848</a><span class='speaker' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns848'>SC Verse 848</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Questioning repeatedly dependent on views,<br>
grasped at again, you’ve arrived at delusion,<br>
not having experienced even a tiny perception of peace,<br>
so therefore you see this as very deluded.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns849' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns849'>SC Verse 849</a>Who as “equal” considers, “greater” or “less”,<br>
conceiving others thus would dispute because of this;<br>
but who by these three never is swayed,<br>
“equal”, “superior” does not exist.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns850' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns850'>SC Verse 850</a>Why would this Brahmin declare “this is the true”,<br>
with whom would he argue that “this is false”,<br>
in whom there is not “equal”, “unequal”,<br>
with whom would he join another in dispute?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns851' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns851'>SC Verse 851</a>With home let go, faring on in homelessness,<br>
in villages the Sage having no intimates,<br>
rid of sensual desires, having no preference,<br>
would not with any arguments people engage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns852' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns852'>SC Verse 852</a>Unattached, one wanders forth in the world,<br>
a Nāga, ungrasping, would not dispute those,<br>
just as the water lily, thorny-stemmed species,<br>
sullied is not by water or mud,<br>
even so is the ungreedy Sage proclaiming Peace,<br>
unsullied by desires and pleasures in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns853' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns853'>SC Verse 853</a>The Wise One’s not conceited by view or by intelligence,<br>
for that one there is no “making-it-mine”;<br>
and cannot be led by good works or by learning,<br>
cannot be led away by mind-shelters of view.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns854' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns854'>SC Verse 854</a>For one detached from perception, there exist no ties,<br>
for one by wisdom freed, no delusions are there,<br>
but those who have grasped perceptions and views,<br>
they wander the world stirring up strife.</p>
