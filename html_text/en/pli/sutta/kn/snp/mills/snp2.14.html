<h1>2.14. To Dhammika: the Pure Hearkeners’ Conduct</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>At one time the Lord dwelt at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There the <i>upāsaka</i> Dhammika accompanied by five hundred <i>upasakas</i> went up to the Radiant One and sat to one side. Having done so and saluted the Radiant One, the <i>upasaka</i> Dhammika addressed him with verses.</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns379'></a><span class='speaker'>Dhammika</span><br>
I ask of Gotama—one profoundly wise:<br>
Behaving in which way a hearkener is good—<br>
whether from home to homelessness gone<br>
or <i>upasakas</i> living the householder’s life.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns380'></a>The birthplaces of this world together with devas<br>
and final Release, you clearly understand,<br>
none compare with you in seeing this profundity<br>
for, as they say, you are Buddha supreme.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns381'></a>All knowledge is yours, you have perfectly revealed<br>
Dharma, out of your compassion for beings all,<br>
remover of the veil, one with the All-round Eye<br>
and stainless do you illuminate the world.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns382'></a>Then came to your presence a <i>nāga</i> renowned,<br>
Erāvaṇa by name, having heard you were a conqueror,<br>
he had secluded talk with you and then attained—<br>
“<i>Sādhu</i>” he exclaimed, and departed, pleased.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns383'></a>Then were there kings, Vessavaṇa, Kuvera,<br>
who came to ask questions on Dharma from you,<br>
so you, O Wise One, being asked then replied,<br>
and they being pleased departed from there.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns384'></a>These theorist sectarians used to dispute—<br>
Ājīvakas and Nigaṇṭhas, all of that kind—<br>
unable in wisdom they go not beyond you,<br>
as a man standing still passes not one running swiftly.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns385'></a>Then there are Brahmins who’re used to dispute—<br>
even old Brahmins are found among them;<br>
or other disputants proud of themselves:<br>
all, for the meaning, depend on you.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns386'></a>This Dharma indeed is blissful, profound,<br>
by you well-proclaimed, O Radiant One,<br>
so wishing to listen are all of us here,<br>
now when we asked, speak to us, Buddha the best.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns387'></a>So let all these bhikkhus well-seated here,<br>
<i>upāsakas</i> too, who likewise wish to listen,<br>
listen to the dharma by the stainless won,<br>
as devas to Vāsava’s well-spoken words.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns388'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Listen, O bhikkhus, I give you chance to hear—<br>
to the Dharma that’s strict—all of you remember it,<br>
let the intelligent seeing the benefit<br>
practise the deportment of one who’s left home.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns389'></a>A bhikkhu in the times proscribed should wander not<br>
but seek for alms timely going round a town;<br>
who goes at times proscribed, temptations do tempt,<br>
so the awakened go not within the wrong time.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns390'></a>Sights with sounds and tastes, smells and touches too—<br>
all these with which beings are completely drunk,<br>
for all of these dharmas let go desire,<br>
and at the right time walk for the morning meal.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns391'></a>A bhikkhu with timely almsfood gained<br>
returns by himself, then seated alone,<br>
contemplative within, not distracted without,<br>
not externalizing, since oneself’s restrained.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns392'></a>Should he with other hearkeners converse,<br>
with bhikkhus, or anyone else at all,<br>
of the Dharma let him speak refined,<br>
not utter slander or another’s blame.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns393'></a>Some, disputatious, offer warfare with words,<br>
but we do not praise them, those of little wit,<br>
bound by attachment to talking this and that,<br>
so certainly they send their minds far away.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18'></a><a class='vns' id='vns394'></a>The truly wise disciple having listened to the Dharma<br>
pointed out by the Well-farer, should carefully use<br>
food-offerings, a sitting and a sleeping place,<br>
with water for washing the principal robes.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19'></a><a class='vns' id='vns395'></a>Let a bhikkhu, therefore, with almsfood and hut<br>
for sitting and sleeping, for his robes washing,<br>
be unsullied, quite unattached,<br>
as water-drop spreads not upon a lotus-leaf.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20'></a><a class='vns' id='vns396'></a>Now I shall tell you the household’s rule,<br>
by practising which one’s a good hearkener,<br>
for by one with possessions it cannot be got—<br>
that dharma complete by a bhikkhu attained.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21'></a><a class='vns' id='vns397'></a>Kill not any beings nor cause them to be killed,<br>
and do not approve of them having been killed,<br>
put by the rod for all that lives—<br>
whether they are weak, or strong in the world.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc22'></a><a class='vns' id='vns398'></a>What is “ungiven”—anything, anywhere,<br>
that’s known to be others’, its theft one should avoid.<br>
Neither order things taken,<br>
nor others’ removal approve—<br>
all of this “ungiven” let the hearkener avoid.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc23'></a><a class='vns' id='vns399'></a>Let the intelligent person live a celibate life,<br>
as one would avoid a pit of glowing coals;<br>
but being unable to live the celibate life,<br>
go not beyond the bounds with others’ partners.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc24'></a><a class='vns' id='vns400'></a>In government assembly, or artisans’ guild,<br>
or one to another, speak not what is false,<br>
not others compel, nor approve of their lies,<br>
all kinds of untruthfulness you should avoid.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc25'></a><a class='vns' id='vns401'></a>Whatever householder this Dharma approves,<br>
in maddening drink should never indulge,<br>
nor make others drink, nor approve if they do,<br>
knowing it leads to a mind that’s disturbed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc26'></a><a class='vns' id='vns402'></a>Fools do many evils because they are drunk,<br>
while causing other people to be negligent.<br>
This basis of demerit should be avoided,<br>
but fools are delighted, confused with mind upset.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc27'></a><a class='vns' id='vns403'></a>Kill not any being, what’s not given do not take,<br>
neither be a liar nor addicted to drink,<br>
and, let go of sex and the non-celibate life,<br>
in the “wrong-time” for food, eat not in the night.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc28'></a><a class='vns' id='vns404'></a>Neither necklaces display nor perfumes employ,<br>
use the ground as a bed or sleep upon a mat:<br>
these are the <i>uposatha</i> eight-factored vows<br>
made known by the Buddha gone to <i>dukkha</i>’s end.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc29'></a><a class='vns' id='vns405'></a>With devotion at heart the <i>uposathas</i> kept,<br>
completely perfected in its eight parts,<br>
on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth days,<br>
as well the days special in the moon’s half months.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc30'></a><a class='vns' id='vns406'></a>Let that one intelligent with devoted heart,<br>
having kept <i>uposatha</i>, early next morning,<br>
distribute food and drink—whatever’s suitable—<br>
to the <i>bhikkhusaṅgha</i>, rejoicing in this act.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc31'></a><a class='vns' id='vns407'></a>Support mother and father according to Dharma,<br>
do business as merchant to honesty adhering,<br>
diligently practising this householder’s rule—<br>
then to the self-radiant devas one will arrive.</p>
