<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1108'></a><span class='speaker'>Bhadra</span><br>
With home let go, craving cut and undisturbed,<br>
delight let go, crossed the flood and free,<br>
time let go and truly wise—I beg of you—<br>
various people here from provinces assembled;</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1109'></a>O Hero, they’re longing for your words,<br>
do well declare these to them now,<br>
for certainly this Dharma has been Known by you,<br>
then having heard the Nāga they’ll depart from here.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1110'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Beyond all acquisitive craving you should train,<br>
above, below, across and in between,<br>
whatever is grasped at in the world,<br>
with that does Māra that person pursue.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1111'></a>Knowing this, therefore the mindful bhikkhu<br>
in all worlds grasps not anything,<br>
understanding well those acquisitive beings,<br>
those people adhering to the realm of death.</p>
