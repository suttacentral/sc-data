<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns83'></a><span class='speaker'>Cunda</span><br>
I ask of the Sage abundantly wise,<br>
Buddha, Lord of Dharma, one who’s craving-free,<br>
Best among men, charioteer beyond compare,<br>
Please do tell me what sorts of samaṇas there are.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns84'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Asked by you personally I shall explain:<br>
Four are the samaṇas, not a fifth is found—<br>
Won to the Path, of the Path the Indicator,<br>
Who lives upon the Path, as well the Path-polluter.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns85'></a><span class='speaker'>Cunda</span><br>
Who do the Buddhas say is winner of the Path?<br>
How will the Path-teacher be incomparable?<br>
Tell about that one who lives upon the Path,<br>
Also the one who is the Path-polluter?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns86'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Whoso has passed beyond the dart of doubts,<br>
Nirvāṇa-delighted, no greediness at all,<br>
Leader of the world together with the gods,<br>
is Such, the Path-winner, so the Buddhas say.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns87'></a>Who knows the Best as what is best indeed,<br>
then teaches Dharma and analyses it,<br>
a sage all doubt severed, one undisturbed,<br>
they call bhikkhu number two, indicator of the Path.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns88'></a>Who lives on the Way, the well-taught Dharma Path,<br>
one well-trained and mindful as well,<br>
whatever’s unobstructing, a practitioner of that<br>
they call bhikkhu number three, one who lives the Path.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns89'></a>Making a semblance of those with good vows,<br>
deceitful one, worthless and quite unrestrained,<br>
Insolent, braggart and family-defiler,<br>
who goes in disguise is polluter of the Path.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns90'></a>A noble disciple who’s recognised each and every one,<br>
and knowing that among them, all are not alike,<br>
this having seen, that person’s faith does not decrease.<br>
For how with the corrupt<br>
can the uncorrupted be compared?<br>
Or those purified with those who are impure?</p>
