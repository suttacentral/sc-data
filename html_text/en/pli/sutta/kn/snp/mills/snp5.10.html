In whom do sense-desires dwell not<br>
and craving can’t be found,<br>
crossed beyond consuming doubt—<br>
what’s freedom for this one?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1096'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
In whom do sense-desires dwell not<br>
and craving can’t be found,<br>
crossed beyond consuming doubt—<br>
than this, is freedom not apart.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1097'></a><span class='speaker'>Todeyya</span><br>
No inclinations or with longings still?<br>
One with wisdom wanting, or with wisdom won?<br>
Explain to me please, O All-seeing Sakya,<br>
how I may well discern a sage.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1098'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
No inclinations at all and no longings left,<br>
not one with wisdom wanting but one with wisdom won<br>
know as a sage, Todeyya, one who nothing owns,<br>
one who is to sensual being unattached.</p>
