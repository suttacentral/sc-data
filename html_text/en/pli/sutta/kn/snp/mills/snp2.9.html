<h1>2.9. What is Good Conduct?</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns327'></a><span class='speaker'>Sāriputta</span><br>
With what kinds of conduct and morality,<br>
growing in what sorts of karmas,<br>
will a person well-established be<br>
for attainment of the highest goal?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns328'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Let that one be an honourer of elders, never envious,<br>
a knower of the right time for the teacher seeing,<br>
and when Dharma’s being taught, a knower of that time<br>
to listen precisely to those well-spoken words.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns329'></a>And at the right time go to the teacher’s presence<br>
in an unassuming way, discarding obstinacy,<br>
with restraint and recollection of the way to practise,<br>
remembering the Dharma for the life of purity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns330'></a>Dwelling in the Dharma, delighted in Dharma,<br>
in Dharma established, and skilled in deciding Dharma,<br>
never uttering words to the Dharma’s detriment,<br>
Let such a one be guided by well-spoken truths.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns331'></a>Disputatiousness, gossip, complaints and ill-will,<br>
deception, hypocrisy, longing and pride,<br>
aggressiveness, harshness, defilements-attached,<br>
fare abandoning these, pride-free, of steady mind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns332'></a>Understanding’s the essence of well-spoken words,<br>
while that and the learnt is the essence of calmness;<br>
but wisdom and learning in one do not grow—<br>
that person who’s hasty and negligent both.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns333'></a>Delighting in Dharma by Noble Ones taught,<br>
their mind, speech and body all unsurpassed—<br>
in gentleness, peace, meditative-states firm,<br>
attained to the essence of wisdom and learning.</p>
