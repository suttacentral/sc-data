I ask the Kinsman of the Sun, the great seeker,<br>
About seclusion and the state of peace.<br>
Seeing what is a bhikkhu quenched,<br>
Not grasping at anything in the world?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns923'>SC Verse 923</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
One should completely extract<br>
The root of proliferation and reckoning—<br>
The notion, “I am the thinker”.<br>
One should train to dispel whatever craving<br>
There is inside, ever mindful.</p>

You have taught me, with your eyes open,<br>
Seeing principles for yourself, dispelling dangers;<br>
Venerable sir, tell me the practice,<br>
The rules of conduct and also meditation.</p>

Places for meditation and sleep.</p>
