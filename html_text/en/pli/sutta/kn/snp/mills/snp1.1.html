<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1'></a>Who removes arisen anger<br>
as herbs a serpent’s venom spread;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns2'></a>Who lust pulls up remainderless<br>
as in water, plants and blooms of lotuses;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns3'></a>Who craving dams remainderless<br>
as drying of a river’s fierce and rapid flow;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns4'></a>Who destroys conceit entire<br>
as a great flood a bridge of reeds so frail;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns5'></a>Who in rebirths no essence finds<br>
as a seeker of flowers on Udumbara trees;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns6'></a>Who keeps no grudges inwardly<br>
but this “being-not being” has gone beyond;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns7'></a>In who do thoughts no longer smoulder,<br>
internally curtailed, remainderless;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns8'></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
all mind-proliferation gone beyond;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a><a class='vns' id='vns9'></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
who of the world has Known, “All is not thus”;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a><a class='vns' id='vns10'></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
who free of greed has Known, “All is not thus”;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a><a class='vns' id='vns11'></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
who free of lust has Known, “All is not thus”;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a><a class='vns' id='vns12'></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
who free of hate has Known, “All is not thus”;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a><a class='vns' id='vns13'></a>Who neither goes too far nor lags behind,<br>
who delusion-free has Known, “All is not thus”;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a><a class='vns' id='vns14'></a>In whom are no latent tendencies at all—<br>
whose roots of evil completely are expunged;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a><a class='vns' id='vns15'></a>In whom is no anxiety at all<br>
to cause return to this existence here;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a><a class='vns' id='vns16'></a>In whom no attachment formed at all<br>
to cause return to all existences;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a><a class='vns' id='vns17'></a>Who’s left behind five hindrances,<br>
serene then, crossed doubt, lacking inner barbs;<br>
a bhikkhu such leaves here and there<br>
as a serpent sloughs its worn-out skin.</p>
