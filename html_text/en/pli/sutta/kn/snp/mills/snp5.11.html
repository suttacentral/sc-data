In midstream standing there,<br>

In midstream standing there,<br>
in flood’s fearsome surge<br>
oppressed by age and death, Kappa,<br>
of the island I shall tell.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1101'></a>“Owning nothing and unattached”<br>
that’s the isle of no-beyond,<br>
Nirvāṇa do I call it<br>
death-decay destroyed.</p>

Now-seen the Dharma, cool-become,<br>
they’re neither under Māra’s sway<br>
nor Māra’s followers.</p>
