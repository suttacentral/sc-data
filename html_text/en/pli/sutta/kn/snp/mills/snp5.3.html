Who has contentment in the world?<br>
Who is not agitated?<br>
Who has experienced both extremes,<br>
but wise, in the middle does not stick?<br>
Who do you say’s a person great?<br>
Who, seamstress-craving’s gone beyond?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1048'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
A pure life leading ’mid pleasures of sense,<br>
ever mindful and craving-free,<br>
a bhikkhu cool, after reflection deep,<br>
agitation’s none in such a one.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1049'></a>Who has experienced both extremes,<br>
who wise, in the middle does not stick,<br>
he, I say, is a person great,<br>
who the seamstress-craving’s gone beyond.</p>
