bloated and livid blue,<br>
cast away in the charnel-ground<br>
kin care for it not.</p>

and lust discarded utterly,<br>
attains to Deathlessness, to peace,<br>
Nirvāṇa, the unchanging state.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns207'>SC Verse 207</a>But this foetid, foul, two-footed thing,<br>
is pampered, though filled<br>
with varied sorts of stench, as well<br>
with oozing here and there.</p>

but thinks to exalt themselves,<br>
or to despise another—<br>
what’s this but wisdom’s lack?</p>
