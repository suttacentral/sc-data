Those elders outside Gotama’s teaching-path<br>
explained their doctrines in this way:<br>
“so it was and so will be”—<br>
all that was but traditional lore,<br>
all that increased uncertainty,<br>
And I took no delight in it.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1092'></a>Please, O Sage, explain to me<br>
Dhamma destroying craving now,<br>
knowing which the mindful fare,<br>
and cross the world’s entanglements.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1093'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Here among all those pleasing things—<br>
the seen and the heard, the sensed and thought—<br>
whose wants removed and passion too—<br>
this the unchanging Nirvāṇa-state.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1094'></a>With Final Knowledge those mindful ones,<br>
now-seen the Dharma, cool-become<br>
and ever they at peace remain,<br>
they’ve crossed the world’s entanglements.</p>
