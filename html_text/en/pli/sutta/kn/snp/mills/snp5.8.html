People say that in the world<br>
there are sages—how is this?<br>
Do they say “sage” for knowledge won,<br>
or for a certain way of life?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1085'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The intelligent ones say not “a sage”,<br>
for view, tradition, knowledge won;<br>
those foeless, desireless and free from distress<br>
who so fare along are sages, I say.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1086'></a><span class='speaker'>Nanda</span><br>
Some of these monks and brahmins they say<br>
that purity comes from the seen and the heard,<br>
from rites and from vows and from other things too,<br>
have they, O Lord, while practising thus<br>
crossed over birth and crossed decay, sir?<br>
I ask the Lord thus, please tell me of this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1087'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Some of these monks and brahmins they say<br>
that purity comes from the seen and the heard,<br>
from rites and from vows and from other things too<br>
and even though they have practised thus,<br>
I say they’ve not crossed over birth and decay.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1088'></a><span class='speaker'>Nanda</span><br>
Some of these monks and brahmins they say<br>
that purity comes from the seen and the heard,<br>
from rites and from vows and from other things too,<br>
if you say, O Sage, they’ve not crossed the flood,<br>
who fares through the world of devas, mankind,<br>
crossed over birth and crossed decay, sir?<br>
I ask the Lord thus, please tell me of this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1089'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Of these monks and these brahmins I do not say<br>
that all are shrouded by birth and decay:<br>
those who’ve let go of the seen, heard, and known,<br>
of rites and of vows and others—all,<br>
completely craving Known and from the inﬂows free—<br>
those persons I say have crossed over the flood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1090'></a><span class='speaker'>Nanda</span><br>
By the Great Seeker’s words I’m truly delighted<br>
well-explained, O Gotama, is “to assets unattached”,<br>
those who’ve let go of the seen, heard and known,<br>
of rites and of vows and of other things—all,<br>
completely craving Known and from the inﬂows free—<br>
also I say they’ve crossed over the flood.</p>
