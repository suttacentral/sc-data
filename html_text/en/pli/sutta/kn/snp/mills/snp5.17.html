<h1>5.17. Piṅgiya’s Question</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1127'></a><span class='speaker'>Piṅgiya</span><br>
Aged am I, feeble and my beauty fled,<br>
my eyes no longer clear, my hearing weak,<br>
let me not die confused along the way,<br>
teach me the Dharma so that I shall know<br>
how to let go of birth and of decay.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1128'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Having seen them smitten by (the sight of) forms,<br>
by bodily forms those careless folk are beaten down,<br>
therefore, Piṅgiya, you should be aware:<br>
let go this bodily form so as not to be reborn.<span class='footnote-anchor'>*<span class='footnote'>Sujato: <abbr>lkm</abbr> had “let go these forms for not again becoming”, which I found barely intelligible; I similarly changed the last line of verse 1130. In addition, this verse contains a grammatical mistake, as <i>rūpa</i> here is singular.</span></span></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1129'></a><span class='speaker'>Piṅgiya</span><br>
There’s nothing in the world: four directions chief,<br>
four intermediates, above, below, ten in all—<br>
unseen, unheard, not felt or known by you;<br>
teach to me Dharma so that when I’ve known it<br>
birth and ageing are both abandoned here.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1130'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Seeing humanity by cravings afflicted—<br>
burnt by being born, overcome by age,<br>
therefore, Piṅgiya, you should be aware:<br>
let go of craving so as not to be reborn.</p>
