O Seeker Great, I long to hear your word,<br>
then having heard your speech,<br>
for Nirvāṇa train myself—<br>
I ask the Lord thus, please tell me of this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1069'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Ascetically exert yourself,<br>
just wise and mindful here,<br>
then having heard my words,<br>
for Nirvāṇa train yourself.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1070'></a><span class='speaker'>Dhotaka</span><br>
In the world of devas and humanity I see<br>
the with-nothing brahmin who wanders about,<br>
to the All-seeing Seer, to you I bow down:<br>
free me, O Sakya, from consuming doubt.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1071'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
I am not able, O Dhotaka, to liberate you<br>
from consuming doubt of whatever kind in the world,<span class='footnote-anchor'>*<span class='footnote'>Sujato: <abbr>lkm</abbr> had “To liberate, O Dhotaka, from consuming doubt, I do not go about the world”, which relied on the variant reading <i>gamissāmi</i>. This however appears to be incorrect, and I have adopted the reading <i>sahissāmi</i> as used in the Mahāsaṅgīti text; see Norman’s note on page 410 of the <i>Group of Discourses</i>.</span></span><br>
but, having Known this Dharma best<br>
beyond this flood you go across.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1072'></a><span class='speaker'>Dhotaka</span><br>
Teach me, O Brahma, out of your compassion,<br>
the State of Seclusion that I may know it well,<br>
so that I may live just like the sky,<br>
kind-minded, peaceful, also clinging-free.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1073'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
This Peace I shall explain to you,<br>
Seen-Now and not traditional lore,<br>
knowing which the mindful fare,<br>
and cross the world’s entanglements.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1074'></a><span class='speaker'>Dhotaka</span><br>
I am delighted, Seeker Great<br>
with this Peace that’s ultimate,<br>
knowing which the mindful fare,<br>
and cross the world’s entanglements.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a><a class='vns' id='vns1075'></a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Whatever you cognize above,<br>
below, across, and in between;<br>
Here having Known clinging just to this,<br>
form no craving for high or low.</p>
