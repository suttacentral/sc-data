<h1>3.5. To Māgha on Giving</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2'>SC 2</a>At one time the Radiant one dwelt at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak Mountain. Then the young brahmin Māgha went to the Radiant One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down to one side and spoke thus to the Radiant One:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3'>SC 3</a>“Master Gotama, I am certainly a donor, one who is generous and glad to comply with others’ requests. From wealth sought rightly, obtained rightly, acquired in accordance with Dharma, I give to one, two, ten, twenty, a hundred or even more—so do I, Master Gotama giving and bestowing in this way accrue much merit?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4'>SC 4</a>“Certainly young brahmin, giving and bestowing in this way you accrue much merit. If anyone is a donor, one who is generous and glad to comply with others’ requests from wealth sought rightly, obtained rightly, acquired in accordance with dharma and given to one, two, ten, twenty, a hundred or even to more, that one accrues much merit.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5'>SC 5</a>Then the brahmin youth Māgha addressed these verses to the Radiant One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns492'>SC Verse 492</a><span class='speaker'>Māgha</span><br>
I ask the world-knower Gotama<br>
who wanders homeless clad in <i>kāsāya</i> cloth:<br>
One glad to comply with others’ requests,<br>
a generous giver, one living at home,<br>
a seeker of merit, desirer of merit,<br>
who to other as sacrifice gives food and drink—<br>
how would such offerings be purified by this?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns493'>SC Verse 493</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
One glad to comply with others’ requests,<br>
a generous giver, one living at home,<br>
a seeker of merit, desirer of merit,<br>
who to others as sacrifice gives food and drink<br>
achieves his results through those worthy of gifts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns494'>SC Verse 494</a><span class='speaker'>Māgha</span><br>
One glad to comply with others’ requests,<br>
a generous giver, one living at home,<br>

Sir, who are the gift-worthy,<br>
please speak about that.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns495'>SC Verse 495</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24'>SC 24</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns510'>SC Verse 510</a><span class='speaker'>Māgha</span><br>
My question truly was not in vain<br>
for the Radiant has spoken of gift-worthy ones.<br>
This indeed you Know as it really is,<br>
for certainly this Dharma’s Known to you.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25'>SC 25</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns511'>SC Verse 511</a>One glad to comply with others’ requests,<br>
a generous giver, one living at home,<br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26'>SC 26</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns512'>SC Verse 512</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Do you sacrifice! But during this sacrificial act,<br>
make your mind happy all of the time;<br>
for the sacrificiant, this sacrifice is the base,<br>
established in this one is rid of all faults.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27'>SC 27</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns513'>SC Verse 513</a>One with passions gone would other faults restrain,<br>
developing boundless <i>mettā</i>-mind, in this,<br>
continuously diligent by day and by night,<br>
suffusing all directions boundlessly.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28'>SC 28</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns514'>SC Verse 514</a><span class='speaker'>Māgha</span><br>
Who can be cleansed, released and Awakened?<br>
With what does the self to the Brahma-world go?<br>
O Sage, when asked reply to me—one who doesn’t know—<br>
for the Radiant I’ve seen with my eyes as Brahmā today<br>
and it’s true that you’re the same as Brahmā for us.<br>
In the Brahma-world,<br>
how does one arise, O Refulgent One?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29'>SC 29</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns515'>SC Verse 515</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The sacrificiant who achieves triple success in sacrifice,<br>
achieves their results through such gift-worthy ones;<br>
so perfected in sacrifice<br>
and complying with others’ requests,<br>
that one arises, I say, within the Brahma-world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30'>SC 30</a>When this was said the young brahmin Māgha said to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what was overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes can see forms. I go for Refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Saṅgha. May Master Gotama remember me as a layman who from today has Gone for Refuge for life.</p>
