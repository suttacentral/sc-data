<h1 class='sutta'>2.4. Discourse on Blessings</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>: On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Savatthi at Jetavana at Anathapindika's monastery. Now when the night was far advanced, a certain deity, whose surpassing radiance illuminated the whole of Jetavana, approached the Blessed One, respectfully saluted him, and stood beside him. Standing thus, he addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Many deities and men longing for happiness have pondered on <span class='add'>the question of</span> blessings. Pray tell me what the highest blessings are.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Not to associate with the foolish, but to associate with the wise, and to honor those worthy of honor—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“To reside in a suitable locality, to have performed meritorious actions in the past, and to set oneself in the right direction—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Vast learning, skill in handicrafts, well grounded in discipline, and pleasant speech—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“To support one's father and mother; to cherish one's wife and children, and to be engaged in peaceful occupations—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“Liberality, righteous conduct, rendering assistance to relatives, and performance of blameless deeds—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>“To cease and abstain from evil, to abstain from intoxicating drinks, and diligent in performing righteous acts—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a>“Reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, and the timely hearing of the Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a>“Patience, obedience, meeting the Samanas <span class='add'>(holy men)</span>, and timely discussions on the Dhamma—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a>“Self-control, chastity, comprehension of the Noble Truths, and the realization of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Nibbana</i>—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a>“The mind that is not touched by the vicissitudes of life, the mind that is free from sorrow, stainless, and secure—this is the highest blessing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a>“Those who have fulfilled the conditions <span class='add'>for such blessings</span> are victorious everywhere, and attain happiness everywhere—To them these are the highest blessings.”</p>
