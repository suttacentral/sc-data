Vision of previous lives is his,<br>

And supernormal knowledge he has mastered.<br>
With these three knowledges possessed by him<br>
He is a brahman true, of threefold knowledge.</p>

The threefold knowledge and has vanquished death.<br>
Having bravely vanquished Mara and his host,<br>
It is the last formation of a body that she bears.</p>

And are now both free of cankers, with well-tamed minds.<br>
Cooled of passions, we have found deliverance;<br>
Cooled of passions, we have found our freedom.</p>
