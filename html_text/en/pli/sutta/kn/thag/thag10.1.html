<p><a class="sc" id="sc1"></a><a class="vns" id="vns527"></a>“The trees are now crimson, venerable sir,<br>
They’ve shed their foliage, and are ready to fruit.<br>
They’re splendid, as if on fire;<br>
Great hero, this period is full of flavour.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc2"></a><a class="vns" id="vns528"></a>The blossoming trees are delightful,<br>
Wafting their scent all around, in all directions,<br>
They’ve shed their leaves and wish to fruit,<br>
Hero, it is time to depart from here.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc3"></a><a class="vns" id="vns529"></a>It is neither too hot nor too cold,<br>
Venerable sir, it’s a pleasant season for travelling.<br>
Let the Sākiyas and Koḷiyas see you,<br>
Facing west as you cross the Rohiṇī river.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc4"></a><a class="vns" id="vns530"></a>In hope, the field is ploughed;<br>
The seed is sown in hope;<br>
In hope, merchants travel the seas,<br>
Carrying rich cargoes.<br>
The hope that I stand for:<br>
May it succeed!</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc5"></a><a class="vns" id="vns531"></a>Again and again, they sow the seed;<br>
Again and again, the king of gods sends rain;<br>
Again and again, farmers plough the field;<br>
Again and again, grain is produced for the nation.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc6"></a><a class="vns" id="vns532"></a>Again and again, the beggars wander,<br>
Again and again, the donors give,<br>
Again and again, when the donors have given,<br>
Again and again, they go to their place in heaven.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc7"></a><a class="vns" id="vns533"></a>A hero of vast wisdom purifies seven generations<br>
Of the family in which they’re born.<br>
Sakya, I believe you’re the king of kings,<br>
Since you fathered the one who is truly called a sage.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc8"></a><a class="vns" id="vns534"></a>The father of the great sage is named Suddhodana;<br>
But the Buddha’s mother is named Māyā.<br>
Having borne the Bodhisatta in her womb,<br>
She rejoices in the heaven of the Thirty-Three.</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc9"></a><a class="vns" id="vns535"></a>When she died and passed away from here,<br>
She was blessed with divine sensual pleasures;<br>
Rejoicing in the five kinds of sensual pleasures,<br>
Gotamī is surrounded by those hosts of gods.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" id="sc10"></a><a class="vns" id="vns536"></a>“I’m the son of the Buddha, the incomparable Aṅgīrasa, the poised—<br>
I bear the unbearable.<br>
You, Sakya, are my father’s father;<br>
Gotama, you are my grandfather in the Dhamma.”</p>

<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book">Elders’s Verses I</cite>, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>
