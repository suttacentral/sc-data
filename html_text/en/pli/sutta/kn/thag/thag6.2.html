Though these winter nights are cold.<br>
Don’t perish, overcome with cold;<br>
Enter your dwelling, with its door shut fast.”</p>

I’ll dwell unperturbed.”</p>

<p>This translation of the Theragāthā was made by <span class="author">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> with <span class="author">Jessica Walton</span>. It is based on the Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali text.</p>
<p>The translation relies heavily on the translation and notes by <span class="author">K.R. Norman</span> for the Pali Text Society, published as <cite class="book" translate="no">Elders’s Verses I</cite translate="no">, first published 1965. For a few verses we have also consulted translations by Bhikkhu Thanissaro and Bhikkhu Bodhi. In all cases, however, the final translation was made directly from the Pali text.</p>
