<h1>The Mind</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='33' data-uid='dhp33'></a>Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning man straightens his mind—so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='34' data-uid='dhp34'></a>As a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers, even so is this mind agitated. Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='35' data-uid='dhp35'></a>Wonderful, indeed, it is to subdue the mind, so difficult to subdue, ever swift, and seizing whatever it desires. A tamed mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='36' data-uid='dhp36'></a>Let the discerning man guard the mind, so difficult to detect and extremely subtle, seizing whatever it desires. A guarded mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='37' data-uid='dhp37'></a>Dwelling in the cave (of the heart), the mind, without form, wanders far and alone. Those who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='38' data-uid='dhp38'></a>Wisdom never becomes perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast, who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='39' data-uid='dhp39'></a>There is no fear for an awakened one, whose mind is not sodden (by lust) nor afflicted (by hate), and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='40' data-uid='dhp40'></a>Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city, fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom. Then, guarding the conquest, remain unattached.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='41' data-uid='dhp41'></a>Ere long, alas! This body will lie upon the earth, unheeded and lifeless, like a useless log.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='42' data-uid='dhp42'></a>Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='43' data-uid='dhp43'></a>Neither mother, father, nor any other relative can do one greater good than one’s own well-directed mind.</p>
