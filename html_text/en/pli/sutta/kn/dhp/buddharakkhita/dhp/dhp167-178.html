<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc167' data-uid='dhp167' href='#sc167' data-uid='dhp167'>SC 167</a>Follow not the vulgar way; live not in heedlessness; hold not false views; linger not long in worldly existence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc168' data-uid='dhp168' href='#sc168' data-uid='dhp168'>SC 168</a>Arise! Do not be heedless! Lead a righteous life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc169' data-uid='dhp169' href='#sc169' data-uid='dhp169'>SC 169</a>Lead a righteous life; lead not a base life. The righteous live happily both in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc170' data-uid='dhp170' href='#sc170' data-uid='dhp170'>SC 170</a>One who looks upon the world as a bubble and a mirage, him the King of Death sees not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc171' data-uid='dhp171' href='#sc171' data-uid='dhp171'>SC 171</a>Come! Behold this world, which is like a decorated royal chariot. Here fools flounder, but the wise have no attachment to it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc172' data-uid='dhp172' href='#sc172' data-uid='dhp172'>SC 172</a>He who having been heedless is heedless no more, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc173' data-uid='dhp173' href='#sc173' data-uid='dhp173'>SC 173</a>He, who by good deeds covers the evil he has done, illuminates this world like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc174' data-uid='dhp174' href='#sc174' data-uid='dhp174'>SC 174</a>Blind is the world; here only a few possess insight. Only a few, like birds escaping from the net, go to realms of bliss.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc175' data-uid='dhp175' href='#sc175' data-uid='dhp175'>SC 175</a>Swans fly on the path of the sun; men pass through the air by psychic powers; the wise are led away from the world after vanquishing Mara and his host.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc176' data-uid='dhp176' href='#sc176' data-uid='dhp176'>SC 176</a>For a liar who has violated the one law (of truthfulness) who holds in scorn the hereafter, there is no evil that he cannot do.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc177' data-uid='dhp177' href='#sc177' data-uid='dhp177'>SC 177</a>Truly, misers fare not to heavenly realms; nor, indeed, do fools praise generosity. But the wise man rejoices in giving, and by that alone does he become happy hereafter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc178' data-uid='dhp178' href='#sc178' data-uid='dhp178'>SC 178</a>Better than sole sovereignty over the earth, better than going to heaven, better even than lordship over all the worlds is the supramundane Fruition of Stream Entrance.</p>
