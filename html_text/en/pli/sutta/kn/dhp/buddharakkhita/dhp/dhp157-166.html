<h1>The Self</h1>

<p><a class='sc' id='157' data-uid='dhp157'></a>If one holds oneself dear, one should diligently watch oneself. Let the wise man keep vigil during any of the three watches of the night.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='158' data-uid='dhp158'></a>One should first establish oneself in what is proper; then only should one instruct others. Thus the wise man will not be reproached.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='159' data-uid='dhp159'></a>One should do what one teaches others to do; if one would train others, one should be well controlled oneself. Difficult, indeed, is self-control.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='160' data-uid='dhp160'></a>One truly is the protector of oneself; who else could the protector be? With oneself fully controlled, one gains a mastery that is hard to gain.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='161' data-uid='dhp161'></a>The evil a witless man does by himself, born of himself and produced by himself, grinds him as a diamond grinds a hard gem.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='162' data-uid='dhp162'></a>Just as a single creeper strangles the tree on which it grows, even so, a man who is exceedingly depraved harms himself as only an enemy might wish.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='163' data-uid='dhp163'></a>Easy to do are things that are bad and harmful to oneself. But exceedingly difficult to do are things that are good and beneficial.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='164' data-uid='dhp164'></a>Whoever, on account of perverted views, scorns the Teaching of the Perfected Ones, the Noble and Righteous Ones—that fool, like the bamboo, produces fruits only for self destruction.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='165' data-uid='dhp165'></a>By oneself is evil done; by oneself is one defiled. By oneself is evil left undone; by oneself is one made pure. Purity and impurity depend on oneself; no one can purify another.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='166' data-uid='dhp166'></a>Let one not neglect one’s own welfare for the sake of another, however great. Clearly understanding one’s own welfare, let one be intent upon the good.</p>
