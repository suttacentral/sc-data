<h1>The Chapter about the Self</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc157' data-uid='dhp157'></a>If one regards oneself as dear one should guard oneself right well,<br>
during one of the three watches <span class='add'>of the night</span> the wise one should stay alert.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc158' data-uid='dhp158'></a>First one should establish oneself in what is suitable,<br>
then one can advise another, the wise one should not have <span class='add'>any</span> defilement.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc159' data-uid='dhp159'></a>He should do himself as he would advise another <span class='add'>to do</span>,<br>
being well-trained, he could surely train <span class='add'>another</span>, for it is said the self is difficult to train.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc160' data-uid='dhp160'></a>For the self is the friend of self, for what other friend would there be?<br>
When the self is well-trained, one finds a friend that is hard to find.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc161' data-uid='dhp161'></a>That wickedness done by oneself, born in oneself, arising in oneself,<br>
crushes the one who is stupid, as a diamond <span class='add'>crushes</span> a rock-jewel.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc162' data-uid='dhp162'></a>The one who has an exceeding lack of virtue, like a deadly creeper covering a Sal tree,<br>
makes himself the same as his enemy wishes him to be.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc163' data-uid='dhp163'></a>Easily done are things not good, and unbeneficial for oneself,<br>
but that which is beneficial and good is supremely hard to do.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc164' data-uid='dhp164'></a>Whoever reviles the worthy teaching of the Noble Ones who live by Dhamma,<br>
that stupid one, depending on wicked views,<br>
like the bamboo when it bears fruit, brings about his own destruction.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc165' data-uid='dhp165'></a>By oneself alone is a wicked deed done, by oneself is one defiled,<br>
by oneself is a wicked deed left undone, by oneself is one purified,<br>
purity and impurity come from oneself, <span class='add'>for</span> no one can purify another.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc166' data-uid='dhp166'></a>One should not neglect one’s own good for another’s, however great;<br>
knowing what is good for oneself one should be intent on that good.</p>
