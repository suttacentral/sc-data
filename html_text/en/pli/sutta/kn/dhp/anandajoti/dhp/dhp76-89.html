<h1>The Chapter about the Wise</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc76' data-uid='dhp76'></a>One should regard someone who shows your faults just like one who points out hidden treasure,<br>
one should keep company with such a sagacious, learned person who reproves you;<br>
keeping company with such is <span class='add'>surely</span> better for you, not worse.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc77' data-uid='dhp77'></a>One should advise and instruct, and forbid whatever is vile,<br>
for he is dear to the good, <span class='add'>but</span> he is not dear to the bad.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc78' data-uid='dhp78'></a>One should not keep company with wicked friends, one should not keep company with the ignoble,<br>
you should keep company with spiritual friends, you should keep company with superior people.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc79' data-uid='dhp79'></a>The one who drinks Dhamma lives well, with a clear mind,<br>
the wise one will always delight in the Dhamma that is made known by the Noble.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc80' data-uid='dhp80'></a>Course-makers lead water,<br>
fletchers straighten arrows,<br>
carpenters straighten wood,<br>
the wise master themselves.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc81' data-uid='dhp81'></a>Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind,<br>
so the wise are not moved by blame or praise.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc82' data-uid='dhp82'></a>Like a lake that is deep, clear and unruffled,<br>
just so the wise are confident after listening to Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc83' data-uid='dhp83'></a>True people surely everywhere renounce,<br>
the good do not talk of desiring sense-pleasures;<br>
when touched by pleasure or by suffering,<br>
the wise show neither elation or depression.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc84' data-uid='dhp84'></a>Not for one’s own sake and not for another’s sake,<br>
not desiring a child, riches, or a kingdom –<br>
he should not desire his success through corruption;<br>
he should be both virtuous and wise and righteous.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc85' data-uid='dhp85'></a>Amongst humans few people go beyond,<br>
the rest of the people run down the bank,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc86' data-uid='dhp86'></a>but those who live righteously, conforming with this well-taught Dhamma,<br>
those folk will go beyond the realm of death, which is very hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc87' data-uid='dhp87'></a>Having abandoned the dark state, the wise one should develop the bright,<br>
having gone forth to homelessness from home; in solitude, where it is hard to delight.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc88' data-uid='dhp88'></a>One should desire to delight in that place, having given up sense pleasures, and having no possessions,<br>
the wise one should purify the self of defilements of mind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc89' data-uid='dhp89'></a>For those who have well developed with right mind the factors of complete awakening,<br>
having given up grasping, those who delight in being unattached,<br>
pollutant-free, shining forth, are emancipated in the world.</p>
