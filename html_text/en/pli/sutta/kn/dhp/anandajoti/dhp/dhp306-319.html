<h1>The Chapter about the Underworld</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc306' data-uid='dhp306'></a>The one who speaks falsely goes to the underworld,<br>
and he who says: ‘I did not do’ what he has done,<br>
both of these are just the same when they have gone<br>
to the hereafter, <span class='add'>they are</span> humans who did base deeds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc307' data-uid='dhp307'></a>Many wearing the monastic robe around their necks are wicked, unrestrained,<br>
the wicked through their wicked deeds re-arisein the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc308' data-uid='dhp308'></a>It’s better to have eaten a glowing iron ball, like a flame of fire,<br>
than that <span class='add'>the monastic</span> who is unrestrained and unvirtuous should enjoy the country’s almsfood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc309' data-uid='dhp309'></a>There are four states the man who is heedless,<br>
the man who consorts with other man’s wives, undergoes:<br>
he gains demerit, an uncomfortable bed,<br>
blame as third, and <span class='add'>rebirth in</span> the underworld as fourth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc310' data-uid='dhp310'></a>Gaining demerit and a bad destiny,<br>
and <span class='add'>only</span> the small delight of a scared man with a scared woman,<br>
and kings who apply heavy punishment,<br>
a man therefore should not consort with another’s wife.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc311' data-uid='dhp311'></a>As jagged grass, wrongly grasped, cuts into the hand,<br>
so does the ascetic life, wrongly grasped, drag one down to the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc312' data-uid='dhp312'></a>Whatever lax deed there is and that vow which is defiled,<br>
<span class='add'>know that</span> a holy life that is doubtful does not have great fruit for that one.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc313' data-uid='dhp313'></a>If he would do what should be done, he should be firm in his effort,<br>
for the wanderer who is lax spreads a lot of impurity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc314' data-uid='dhp314'></a>Better undone is a wrong-doing, a wrong-doing one later regrets,<br>
better done is what is well-done, which, when done, one does not regret.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc315' data-uid='dhp315'></a>As a border town is guarded on the inside and the outside,<br>
so one should watch over oneself, and you should not let the moment pass,<br>
for when the chance has passed they grieve when consigned to the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc316' data-uid='dhp316'></a>They are ashamed of what is not shameful, not ashamed of what is shameful,<br>
undertaking wrong views, beings go to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc317' data-uid='dhp317'></a>Seeing fear in what is not fearful, not seeing fear in what is fearful,<br>
undertaking wrong views, beings go to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc318' data-uid='dhp318'></a>Finding blame in what is blameless, not seeing blame in what is blameable,<br>
undertaking wrong views, beings go to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc319' data-uid='dhp319'></a>Knowing blame in what is blameable, and no blame in what is blameless,<br>
undertaking right views, beings go to a good destiny.</p>
