<h1>The Chapter about Wickedness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc116' data-uid='dhp116'></a>Hasten to do wholesome deeds, ward off the mind from wickedness,<br>
for the mind of the one slow in merit delights in wickedness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc117' data-uid='dhp117'></a>Should a person do that which is wicked, he should not do it again and again,<br>
let him not place his intention in it, <span class='add'>for</span> there is an accumulation of suffering for the wicked one.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc118' data-uid='dhp118'></a>If a person should make merit, he should do it again and again,<br>
let him place his intention there, there is an increase of joy for the one who has made merit.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc119' data-uid='dhp119'></a>Even the wicked one experiences good fortune while the wickedness does not ripen,<br>
but when the wickedness ripens then the wicked one experiences wicked things.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc120' data-uid='dhp120'></a>Even the fortunate one experiences wickedness as long as the good fortune does not ripen,<br>
but when the fortune ripens then the fortunate one experiences good fortune.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc121' data-uid='dhp121'></a>One should not despise a little wickedness <span class='add'>thinking</span>: it will not come to me,<br>
through the falling of water drops the water-pot is <span class='add'>quickly</span> filled,<br>
the fool, gathering bit by bit, becomes full of wickedness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc122' data-uid='dhp122'></a>One should not despise a little merit <span class='add'>thinking</span>: it will not come to me,<br>
through the falling of water drops the water-pot is <span class='add'>quickly</span> filled,<br>
the wise one, gathering bit by bit, becomes full of merit.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc123' data-uid='dhp123'></a>Like a merchant on a fearful path, with few friends and great wealth,<br>
as one loving life <span class='add'>would avoid</span> poison, <span class='add'>so</span> should one avoid wicked deeds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc124' data-uid='dhp124'></a>If there is no wound in his hand he can carry poison with his hand,<br>
poison does not enter without a wound, there is no bad result for the one who does no <span class='add'>wrong</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc125' data-uid='dhp125'></a>One offends against the inoffensive one,<br>
a purified and passionless person,<br>
that wicked deed <span class='add'>then</span> returns to the fool,<br>
like fine dust that is thrown against the wind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc126' data-uid='dhp126'></a>Some are reborn in the womb, <span class='add'>but</span> those who are wicked in the underworld,<br>
the righteous go to heaven, those who are pollutant-free are emancipated.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc127' data-uid='dhp127'></a>Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean,<br>
nor after entering a mountain cleft:<br>
there is no place found on this earth<br>
where one can be free from <span class='add'>the results of</span> wicked deeds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc128' data-uid='dhp128'></a>Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean,<br>
nor after entering a mountain cleft:<br>
there is no place found on this earth,<br>
in which death does not overcome one.</p>
