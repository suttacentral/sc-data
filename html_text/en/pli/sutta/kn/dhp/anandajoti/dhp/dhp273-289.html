<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc273' data-uid='dhp273'>SC 273</a>The eightfold is the best of paths, four principles <span class='add' href='#sc273' data-uid='dhp273'>SC 273</a>The eightfold is the best of paths, four principles <span class='add'>the best</span> of truths,<br>
passionlessness the best of states, the Visionary <span class='add'>the best</span> of men.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc274' data-uid='dhp274' href='#sc274' data-uid='dhp274'>SC 274</a>This is the path, there is no other, for insight and for purity,<br>
you should enter upon this path, this is the confounding of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc275' data-uid='dhp275' href='#sc275' data-uid='dhp275'>SC 275</a>Having entered upon this path you will make an end to suffering,<br>
the path was declared by me, the removal of the dart by knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc276' data-uid='dhp276' href='#sc276' data-uid='dhp276'>SC 276</a>Your duty is to have ardour declare the Realised Ones,<br>
entering this path meditators will be released from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc277' data-uid='dhp277' href='#sc277' data-uid='dhp277'>SC 277</a>All conditions are impermanent, when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering – this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc278' data-uid='dhp278' href='#sc278' data-uid='dhp278'>SC 278</a>All conditions are suffering, when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering – this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc279' data-uid='dhp279'>SC 279</a>All components <span class='add' href='#sc279' data-uid='dhp279'>SC 279</a>All components <span class='add'>of mind and body</span> are without self, when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering – this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc280' data-uid='dhp280' href='#sc280' data-uid='dhp280'>SC 280</a>The one who has not energy at a time for energy,<br>
youthful, strong, <span class='add'>but</span> given to laziness,<br>
whose mind lacks <span class='add'>right</span> intention and is indolent –<br>
the lazy one does not find wisdom’s path.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc281' data-uid='dhp281' href='#sc281' data-uid='dhp281'>SC 281</a>Verbally guarded, well-restrained in mind,<br>
not doing a wrong deed with the body,<br>
one should purify these three paths of action,<br>
one should undertake the path shown by seers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc282' data-uid='dhp282' href='#sc282' data-uid='dhp282'>SC 282</a>From effort arises wisdom, without effort wisdom is destroyed,<br>
having understood these two paths of development and decline,<br>
one should establish oneself so that one’s wisdom increases.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc283' data-uid='dhp283'>SC 283</a>Cut down the forest <span class='add' href='#sc283' data-uid='dhp283'>SC 283</a>Cut down the forest <span class='add'>of defilements</span> not just a tree, from the forest arises a danger,<br>
having cut down the forest and thicket, you should be without forests, monastics.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc284' data-uid='dhp284' href='#sc284' data-uid='dhp284'>SC 284</a>For as long as an atom of desire<br>
of a man for a woman is not cut down,<br>
for just so long is the mind in bondage,<br>
like a calf <span class='add'>in bondage</span> to mother’s milk.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc285' data-uid='dhp285'>SC 285</a>Cut off <span class='add' href='#sc285' data-uid='dhp285'>SC 285</a>Cut off <span class='add'>any</span> affection for one’s self,<br>
like an autumn lotus <span class='add'>plucked</span> with the hand,<br>
develop fully the path to peace and<br>
Nibbāna taught by the Fortunate One.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc286' data-uid='dhp286' href='#sc286' data-uid='dhp286'>SC 286</a>“Here I will dwell during the rains, here during winter and summer”,<br>
in just such a way a fool thinks, not understanding the danger.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc287' data-uid='dhp287' href='#sc287' data-uid='dhp287'>SC 287</a>That person whose mind is attached and besotted by cattle and children,<br>
is snatched away by death just as a sleeping village <span class='add'>by</span> a great flood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc288' data-uid='dhp288' href='#sc288' data-uid='dhp288'>SC 288</a>Children are not a refuge, nor fathers, not even kin,<br>
for one overcome by the End-Maker there is no refuge in relatives.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc289' data-uid='dhp289' href='#sc289' data-uid='dhp289'>SC 289</a>Understanding the truth of this the wise one, endowed with virtue,<br>
should quickly purify the path that is leading to Nibbāna.</p>
