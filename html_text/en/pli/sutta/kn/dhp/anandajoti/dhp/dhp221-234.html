<h1>The Chapter about Anger</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc221' data-uid='dhp221'></a>One should abandon anger, one should abandon conceit,<br>
one should overcome every fetter,<br>
without clinging to mind and bodily form,<br>
sufferings never do befall the one having no possessions.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc222' data-uid='dhp222'></a>Whoever should hold back arisen anger just like a swerving chariot,<br>
that one I say is a charioteer, other people are just rein-holders.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc223' data-uid='dhp223'></a>Through kindness one should overcome anger, through goodness one should overcome a lack of goodness,<br>
through gifts one should overcome stinginess, through truth <span class='add'>one should overcome</span> lying speech.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc224' data-uid='dhp224'></a>One should speak out the truth, one should not get angry, when requested give, if only a little,<br>
through these three conditions one can go to the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc225' data-uid='dhp225'></a>Those sages without violence, constantly restrained in body,<br>
go to the deathless <span class='add'>Nibbāna</span>, having gone there they do not grieve.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc226' data-uid='dhp226'></a>For those who are always wakeful, who train both by day and by night,<br>
who are intent on Nibbāna, the pollutants are laid to rest.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc227' data-uid='dhp227'></a>This is something of old, Atula, this is not something of today:<br>
they blame the one who sits silently, they blame the one who talks a lot,<br>
they blame the one who talks in moderation, there is no one in the world not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc228' data-uid='dhp228'></a>There was not and there will not be, and at present there is not found<br>
a person totally blameworthy, or one totally praiseworthy.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc229' data-uid='dhp229'></a>The one who, after being examined day by day, is praised by the wise,<br>
faultless in conduct, sagacious, attending to virtue and wisdom,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc230' data-uid='dhp230'></a>one who is like a golden coin, who is there worthy to blame him?<br>
That one is praised by the gods, and has been praised by the Brahmās too.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc231' data-uid='dhp231'></a>One should guard against bodily anger, one should be restrained bodily,<br>
abandoning wrong bodily conduct, one should have good bodily conduct.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc232' data-uid='dhp232'></a>One should guard against verbal anger, one should be restrained verbally,<br>
abandoning wrong verbal conduct, one should have good verbal conduct.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc233' data-uid='dhp233'></a>One should guard against mental anger, one should be restrained mentally,<br>
abandoning wrong mental conduct, one should have good mental conduct.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc234' data-uid='dhp234'></a>The wise are restrained bodily, then they are restrained verbally,<br>
the wise are restrained mentally, they are indeed very well-restrained.</p>
