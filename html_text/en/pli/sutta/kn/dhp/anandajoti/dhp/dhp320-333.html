<h1>The Chapter about the Elephant</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc320' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Like an elephant in battle <span class='add'>endures</span> an arrow shot from bow<br>
<span class='add'>so</span> will I endure abuse, for many people are unvirtuous.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc321' data-uid='dhp1'></a>They lead one trained into a crowd, a king mounts one who has been trained,<br>
amongst humans one trained is best, the one who can endure abuse.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc322' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Noble are the well-trained horses, the well-bred horses from Sindh,<br>
and the great tusker elephants, <span class='add'>and even</span> more noble than that is the one who has trained himself.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc323' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Not by these vehicles can one go to the place beyond destinations,<br>
as one through training himself well, being trained by the training, goes.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc324' data-uid='dhp1'></a>The tusker named Dhanapālaka<br>
musty in rut, difficult to restrain,<br>
bound, he doesn’t eat <span class='add'>even</span> a morsel,<br>
the tusker remembers the elephant forest.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc325' data-uid='dhp1'></a>When one is torpid and overeats,<br>
sleepy and rolling on the bed,<br>
like a great pig fed on fodder,<br>
that fool comes to the womb again.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc326' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Formerly this wandering mind wandered<br>
through desire, pleasure and happiness,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> today I will control it wisely,<br>
like one with goad an elephant in rut.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc327' data-uid='dhp1'></a>You should delight in heedfulness, you should always protect your mind,<br>
you should raise yourself from this pit like the tusker sunk in the mud.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc328' data-uid='dhp1'></a>If you should find a prudent friend<br>
or companion, one who lives well, a wise one,<br>
overcoming all your troubles<br>
you should live with that one, glad and mindful.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc329' data-uid='dhp1'></a>If you do not find a prudent friend<br>
or companion, one who lives well, a wise one,<br>
like a king who abandons his conquered kingdom<br>
one should live alone like a solitary elephant in the forest.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc330' data-uid='dhp1'></a>It is better to live alone, there can be no friendship with a fool,<br>
one should live alone and not do anything bad,<br>
unconcerned like a solitary elephant in the forest.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc331' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Friends are good whenever need arises,<br>
being content with everything is good,<br>
at the break-up of life merit is good,<br>
the abandoning of all suffering is good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc332' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Respecting one’s mother is good in the world, also respecting one’s father is good,<br>
respecting ascetics is good in the world, also respecting <span class='add'>true</span> brahmins is good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc333' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Virtuous conduct till old age is good, the establishing of faith is good,<br>
the acquisition of wisdom is good, doing nothing wicked is good.</p>
