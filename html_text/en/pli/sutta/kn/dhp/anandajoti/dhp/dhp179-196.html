<h1>The Chapter about the Buddha</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc179' data-uid='dhp179'></a>He whose victory cannot be undone,<br>
whose victory no one here approaches,<br>
the Buddha, whose range is endless,<br>
by what path can you lead the pathless one?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc180' data-uid='dhp180'></a>For him there is no desire, attachment,<br>
or craving to lead <span class='add'>him</span> anywhere,<br>
the Buddha, whose range is endless,<br>
by what path can you lead the pathless one?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc181' data-uid='dhp181'></a>Those wise ones intent on meditation, who delight in the peace of renunciation,<br>
even the gods are envious of them, the Sambuddhas, the ones who are mindful.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc182' data-uid='dhp182'></a>It is rare to acquire <span class='add'>birth as a</span> human, rare is the life of mortals,<br>
it is rare to hear the True Dhamma, rare the arising of Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc183' data-uid='dhp183'></a>The non-doing of anything wicked, undertaking of what is good,<br>
the purification of one’s mind - this is the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc184' data-uid='dhp184'></a>Enduring patience is the supreme austerity,<br>
Nibbāna is supreme say the Buddhas,<br>
for one gone forth does not hurt another,<br>
<span class='add'>nor does</span> an ascetic harass another.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc185' data-uid='dhp185'></a>Not finding fault, not hurting, restraint by the regulations,<br>
knowing the right measure of food, <span class='add'>living in</span> a remote dwelling,<br>
devotion to meditation - this is the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc186' data-uid='dhp186'></a>Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found for sense desires,<br>
the wise one knowing: “Sense pleasures have little joy, <span class='add'>much</span> suffering,”<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc187' data-uid='dhp187'></a>does not find delight even in heavenly pleasures.<br>
The disciple of the Perfect Sambuddha delights in craving’s destruction.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc188' data-uid='dhp188'></a>Many people shaken by fear go for refuge<br>
to woods and mountains, to tree shrines in pleasure parks.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc189' data-uid='dhp189'></a>That is not a secure refuge, that is not the refuge supreme,<br>
that is not the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc190' data-uid='dhp190'></a>Whoever has gone refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha,<br>
and who sees with right wisdom the four noble truths:<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc191' data-uid='dhp191'></a>Suffering, arising of suffering, and the overcoming of suffering,<br>
the eightfold noble path leading to the stilling of suffering.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc192' data-uid='dhp192'></a>That is a secure refuge, that is the refuge supreme,<br>
that is the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc193' data-uid='dhp193'></a>A person of good breed is rare, that one is not born everywhere,<br>
wherever that wise one is born, that family gains happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc194' data-uid='dhp194'></a>The arising of the Buddhas is good, the teaching of the True Dhamma is good,<br>
the harmony of the Saṅgha is good, devotion to harmony is good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc195' data-uid='dhp195'></a>For those who worship those worthy of worship, whether Buddhas or disciples,<br>
who have overcome the impediments, crossed over grief and lamentation;<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc196' data-uid='dhp196'></a>for those who worship such as these, the emancipated, the fearless,<br>
no one is able to measure their <span class='add'>vast</span> merit, <span class='add'>saying:</span> it is as much as this.</p>
