<h1>The Chapter about Happiness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc197' data-uid='dhp197'></a>Let us live truly happily, without hatred, amongst those who have hatred,<br>
amongst humans who have hatred let us live without hatred.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc198' data-uid='dhp198'></a>Let us live truly happily, without sickness, amongst those who are sick,<br>
amongst humans who have sickness let us live without sickness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc199' data-uid='dhp199'></a>Let us live truly happily, without longing, amongst those who are longing,<br>
amongst humans who are longing let us live without longing.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc200' data-uid='dhp200'></a>We live truly happily enough having no possessions ourselves,<br>
we will feed on joy like the gods of Streaming Light.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc201' data-uid='dhp201'></a>The victor generates hatred, the defeated one finds suffering,<br>
the one at peace lives happily, having abandoned victory and defeat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc202' data-uid='dhp202'></a>There is no fire like passion, there is no offence like hatred,<br>
there is no suffering like the components <span class='add'>of mind and body</span>, no happiness other than peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc203' data-uid='dhp203'></a>Hunger is the supreme sickness, conditions are the supreme suffering,<br>
knowing this as it really is, <span class='add'>know</span> Nibbāna is the supreme good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc204' data-uid='dhp204'></a>Health is the supreme gain, content the supreme wealth,<br>
confidence the supreme kin, Nibbāna the supreme good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc205' data-uid='dhp205'></a>Savouring the taste of solitude, and the taste of peace,<br>
he is fearless, faultless, savouring the joyful taste of Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc206' data-uid='dhp206'></a>Meeting with the noble is good, living together <span class='add'>with them</span> is always pleasant,<br>
through not meeting foolish people one will constantly be happy.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc207' data-uid='dhp207'></a>For he who consorts with fools grieves for a long time,<br>
dwelling with fools is always suffering as it is with enemies,<br>
the wise one dwells happily as with an assembly of kin.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc208' data-uid='dhp208'></a>therefore,<br>
the firm, the wise and the learned,<br>
the virtuous, dutiful and noble –<br>
<span class='add'>accompany</span> such a true and intelligent person<br>
as the moon accompanies the course of the stars.</p>
