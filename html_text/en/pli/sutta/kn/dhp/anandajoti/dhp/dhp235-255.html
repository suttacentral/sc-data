<h1>The Chapter about Stains</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc235' data-uid='dhp235'></a>You are now like a withered leaf,<br>
Yama’s men stand waiting for you,<br>
you stand at decay’s door,<br>
with no provisions for the journey found.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc236' data-uid='dhp236'></a>One should make an island for oneself,<br>
soon the wise one should endeavour,<br>
removing the stain, blemishless,<br>
you will go to the divine and noble realm.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc237' data-uid='dhp237'></a>You are now advanced in age,<br>
you have come to Yama’s presence,<br>
there is nowhere to dwell in between,<br>
with no provisions for the journey found.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc238' data-uid='dhp238'></a>One should make an island for oneself,<br>
soon the wise one should endeavour,<br>
removing the stain, blemishless,<br>
you will not come to birth and old age again.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc239' data-uid='dhp239'></a>The sage gradually, little by little, moment by moment,<br>
should remove the stain from himself, like a smith <span class='add'>removes the stain</span> from silver.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc240' data-uid='dhp240'></a>As a <span class='add'>rust</span> stain arises from iron,<br>
and arisen from that, it eats it away,<br>
so with one who is overindulgent –<br>
his deeds lead him to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc241' data-uid='dhp241'></a>Lack of repetition is the ruin of chants, a lack of maintenance is the ruin of homes,<br>
indolence is the ruin of one’s appearance, heedlessness is the ruin of the one on guard.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc242' data-uid='dhp242'></a>Bad conduct is a woman’s stain, stinginess is a giver’s stain,<br>
wicked actions are indeed stains both in this world and in the next.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc243' data-uid='dhp243'></a>A stain that is worse than that stain, ignorance is the supreme stain,<br>
after abandoning that stain, be without stains, O monastics!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc244' data-uid='dhp244'></a>Life is light for one without shame, with the bold courage of a crow,<br>
living a life with backbiting, recklessness, and defilements.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc245' data-uid='dhp245'></a>Life is hard when endowed with shame, for the one constantly seeking purity,<br>
for one sincere, and not reckless, looking for purity of life.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc246' data-uid='dhp246'></a>Whoever kills a living being, and speaks a word that is not true,<br>
takes what is not given here, and goes to another’s wife,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc247' data-uid='dhp247'></a>that person who is devoted to a drink of liquor and wine,<br>
digs up his own root right here in the world.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc248' data-uid='dhp248'></a>Know it thus, dear sir, a lack of restraint is a bad thing,<br>
let not greed and corruption oppress you with suffering for a long time.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc249' data-uid='dhp249'></a>The people give according to faith, according to their confidence,<br>
herein the one who becomes dejected because of food and drink <span class='add'>given</span> to others<br>
he does not, either by day or nigh attain to <span class='add'>good</span> concentration.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc250' data-uid='dhp250'></a>For the one in whom this <span class='add'>dejection</span> is cut off, destroyed at the root, dug up,<br>
does, by day and night, attain to <span class='add'>good</span> concentration.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc251' data-uid='dhp251'></a>There is no fire that is like passion, there is nothing that takes a hold like hatred,<br>
there is no snare like delusion, there is no flood like craving.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc252' data-uid='dhp252'></a>Easy to see are others’ fault, but one’s own is hard to see,<br>
for one sifts other peoples’ faults like they were chaff,<br>
but conceals one’s own <span class='add'>faults</span>, like a crafty cheat <span class='add'>conceals</span> his defeat.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc253' data-uid='dhp253'></a>The one who constantly looks for another’s fault, who is an abject complainer,<br>
for him the pollutants increase, he is far from their destruction.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc254' data-uid='dhp254'></a>There is no footprint in the sky, there is no ascetic on the outside,<br>
folk greatly delight in impediments, the Realised Ones are free of impediments.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc255' data-uid='dhp255'></a>There is no footprint in the sky, there is no ascetic on the outside,<br>
there are no constant conditions, there is no disturbance for the Buddhas.</p>
