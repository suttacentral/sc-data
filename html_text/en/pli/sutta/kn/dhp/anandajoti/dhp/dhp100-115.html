<h1>The Chapter about the Thousands</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc100' data-uid='dhp100'></a>Though there are a thousand sayings consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one useful word hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc101' data-uid='dhp101'></a>Though there are a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one word of a verse hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc102' data-uid='dhp102'></a>One may speak a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc103' data-uid='dhp103'></a>One may conquer a thousand men a thousand times in a battle,<br>
but having conquered one’s own self, one would surely be supreme in battle.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc104' data-uid='dhp104'></a>Conquest over self is better than that over other people,<br>
for the person who conquers himself, who lives constantly well-restrained,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc105' data-uid='dhp105'></a>neither gods, nor gandhabbas, nor Māra together with Brahmās,<br>
can turn conquest into defeat for a person who is like this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc106' data-uid='dhp106'></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand <span class='add'>coins of money</span> month by month for a hundred <span class='add'>years</span>;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second –<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc107' data-uid='dhp107'></a>One person might care for the fire in the woods for a hundred years;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second –<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc108' data-uid='dhp108'></a>Whatever the alms or the sacrifice in the world<br>
the one seeking merit may give for a year,<br>
all that comes not to a quarter <span class='add'>of the merit</span> –<br>
better is the worship of the upright.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc109' data-uid='dhp109'></a>For the one who is constantly worshipping honourable elders,<br>
four things increase: the length of life, beauty, happiness, and strength.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc110' data-uid='dhp110'></a>One might live for a hundred years, unvirtuous and uncomposed,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one with virtue and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc111' data-uid='dhp111'></a>One might live for a hundred years, lacking in wisdom, uncomposed,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one endowed with wisdom and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc112' data-uid='dhp112'></a>One might live for a hundred years, indolent, with less energy,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one with energy set up and firm.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc113' data-uid='dhp113'></a>One might live for a hundred years without seeing rise and fall,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better <span class='add'>for the one</span> seeing rise and fall.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc114' data-uid='dhp114'></a>One might live for a hundred years without seeing the deathless state,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better <span class='add'>for one</span> seeing the deathless state.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc115' data-uid='dhp115'></a>One might live for a hundred years without seeing the supreme state,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better <span class='add'>for one</span> seeing the supreme state.</p>
