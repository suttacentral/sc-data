<h1>The Chapter about the Mind</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc33' data-uid='dhp33'></a>An agitated, unsteady mind, difficult to guard, difficult to ward,<br>
the sagacious one makes straight, as a fletcher does his arrow.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc34' data-uid='dhp34'></a>Like a fish thrown up on dry land, pulled out from its watery home,<br>
the mind is agitated, <span class='add'>one ought</span> to throw off the sway of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc35' data-uid='dhp35'></a>For the mind that is difficult to subdue, flighty, flitting wherever it will,<br>
restraint is good, a restrained mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc36' data-uid='dhp36'></a>Hard to see, very subtle, flitting wherever it will,<br>
the sage should guard the mind, a guarded mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc37' data-uid='dhp37'></a>Those who will restrain the mind that roams far,<br>
is lonesome, without a body, hidden, gain release from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc38' data-uid='dhp38'></a>For the one with unsettled mind, who does not know the True Dhamma,<br>
whose confidence is wavering, wisdom is unfulfilled.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc39' data-uid='dhp39'></a>For the one with mind free of lust, for the one with mind unperplexed,<br>
for the one who has abandoned making merit and demerit, for the watchful, there is no fear.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc40' data-uid='dhp40'></a>Knowing this body is <span class='add'>frail</span> like a jar,<br>
establishing the mind like a fortress,<br>
fight Māra with the weapon of wisdom,<br>
guard your success, and do not be attached.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc41' data-uid='dhp41'></a>Before long has passed by, alas, this body will lie on the ground,<br>
rejected, without consciousness, just like a useless piece of wood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc42' data-uid='dhp42'></a>Whatever an aggressor might do to an aggressor, or an enemy to an enemy –<br>
a mind that is badly-directed can do far worse than that to him.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc43' data-uid='dhp43'></a>Mother and father might not do for him, or other relatives,<br>
as much good as a mind that is well-directed can do for him.</p>
