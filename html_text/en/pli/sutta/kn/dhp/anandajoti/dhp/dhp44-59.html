<h1>The Chapter about Flowers</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc44' data-uid='dhp44'></a>Who will know this earth<br>
and the lower realm, together with the gods?<br>
Who <span class='add'>will reflect</span> on the well-taught verse of Dhamma<br>
as a good man reflects on a flower?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc45' data-uid='dhp45'></a>The trainee will know this earth<br>
and the lower realm, together with the gods.<br>
The trainee <span class='add'>will reflect</span> on the well-taught verse of Dhamma<br>
as a good man reflects on a flower.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc46' data-uid='dhp46'></a>Knowing that this body is just like froth,<br>
understanding it has the nature of a mirage,<br>
cutting off Māra’s flower-tipped <span class='add'>arrows</span>,<br>
one should go beyond the King of Death’s sight.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc47' data-uid='dhp47'></a>Death takes up and carries away the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
like a great flood <span class='add'>carries off</span> a sleeping village.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc48' data-uid='dhp48'></a>The End-Maker takes control of the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
even though he is unsated with sense pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc49' data-uid='dhp49'></a>Just as a bee, without hurting the flower, its colour or scent,<br>
gathers its nectar and escapes, so should the seer roam in the village.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc50' data-uid='dhp50'></a>Not the wrongs of others, or what others have done or have not done<br>
one should consider, but what has been done and not done by oneself.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc51' data-uid='dhp51'></a>Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, but lacks fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitless for the one who acts not <span class='add'>on them</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc52' data-uid='dhp52'></a>Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, and has fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitful for the one who does act <span class='add'>on them</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc53' data-uid='dhp53'></a>Just as from a heap of flowers one might make a lot of garlands,<br>
so should many good deeds be done by one who is born a mortal.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc54' data-uid='dhp54'></a>The fragrance of flowers goes not against the wind,<br>
nor does sandalwood or pinwheel or white jasmine,<br>
but the fragrance of the good goes against the wind,<br>
the true person’s <span class='add'>fragrance</span> permeates all directions.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc55' data-uid='dhp55'></a>Sandalwood, pinwheel, then water lily and striped jasmine,<br>
amongst these kinds of fragrance virtue’s fragrance is unsurpassed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc56' data-uid='dhp56'></a>Pinwheel and sandalwood fragrance are insignificant,<br>
but the fragrance of one who has virtue flutters supreme amongst the gods.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc57' data-uid='dhp57'></a>Māra cannot find the path of those endowed with virtue, who live heedfully,<br>
and who are freed through complete and deep knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc58' data-uid='dhp58'></a>Just as in a forsaken and discarded heap along the highway<br>
a lotus might arise in that place, with a pure fragrance, delighting the mind,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc59' data-uid='dhp59'></a>so amongst the forsaken, the Perfect Sambuddha’s disciple<br>
outshines the blind and ordinary folk through his wisdom.</p>
