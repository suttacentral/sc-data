<h2>The Chapter about the Pairs</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Mind precedes thoughts, mind is their chief, <span class='add'>their quality is</span> made by mind,<br>
if with a base mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that suffering follows him like a wheel <span class='add'>follows</span> the ox’s foot.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc2' data-uid='dhp2'></a>Mind precedes thoughts, mind is their chief, <span class='add'>their quality is</span> made by mind,<br>
if with pure mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that happiness follows him like a shadow which does not depart.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3' data-uid='dhp3'></a>“He abused me, he struck at me, he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who bear ill-will towards this their hatred is never appeased.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc4' data-uid='dhp4'></a>“He abused me, he struck at me, he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who do not bear ill-will towards this their hatred is appeased.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5' data-uid='dhp5'></a>For not by hatred do hatreds cease at any time in this place,<br>
they only cease with non-hatred, this truth is <span class='add'>surely</span> eternal.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6' data-uid='dhp6'></a>The others do not understand that we should restrain ourselves here,<br>
but <span class='add'>for</span> those here who do understand, through that, <span class='add'>their</span> dissensions will cease.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7' data-uid='dhp7'></a>Living contemplating what is pleasant, uncontrolled in sense faculties,<br>
not knowing the limit in food, indolent, low in energy –<br>
Māra surely overthrows that one, like wind <span class='add'>overthrows</span> a weak tree.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc8' data-uid='dhp8'></a>Living contemplating the unpleasant, well-controlled in sense faculties,<br>
and knowing the limit in food, faithful, with energy aroused –<br>
Māra does not overthrow that one, just as wind does not <span class='add'>overthrow</span> a mountain made of rock.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9' data-uid='dhp9'></a>The one who, while still impure, would wear the renunciant’s robe,<br>
unendowed with restraint and truth, is not worthy of the renunciant’s robe.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc10' data-uid='dhp10'></a>The one who, steady in virtue, throws out <span class='add'>any</span> impurity,<br>
endowed with restraint and truth, is indeed worthy of the renunciant’s robe.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11' data-uid='dhp11'></a>Finding the essential in what is unessential, and seeing the unessential in what is essential,<br>
they do not understand what is essential, and resort to wrong intention.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc12' data-uid='dhp12'></a>Knowing the essential in what is essential, and the unessential in what is unessential,<br>
they understand what is essential, and resort to right intention.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13' data-uid='dhp13'></a>Just as the rain penetrates a house with thatching that is poor,<br>
so passion penetrates a mind that is undeveloped.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc14' data-uid='dhp14'></a>Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,<br>
so passion cannot penetrate a mind that is well-developed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15' data-uid='dhp15'></a>Here he laments, after death he laments,<br>
the wicked one laments in both places,<br>
he laments, he suffers vexation,<br>
seeing the defilement of his own deeds.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc16' data-uid='dhp16'></a>Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices,<br>
the meritorious one rejoices in both places,<br>
he rejoices, he greatly rejoices,<br>
seeing the purity of his own deeds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17' data-uid='dhp17'></a>Here he suffers, after death he suffers,<br>
the wicked one suffers in both places,<br>
he suffers, thinking: “I have done wickedness,”<br>
gone to a bad fate, he suffers much more.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc18' data-uid='dhp18'></a>Here she is happy, after death she is happy,<br>
the righteous one is happy in both places,<br>
she is happy, thinking: “I have done merit,”<br>
gone to a good fate, she is happy much more.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19' data-uid='dhp19'></a>Even though reciting abundant scriptures,<br>
the heedless fellow, who does not do <span class='add'>what they say</span>,<br>
like a cowboy counting other’s cattle,<br>
does not partake of the ascetic life.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20' data-uid='dhp20'></a>Even though reciting but few scriptures,<br>
but living righteously in accordance with Dhamma,<br>
abandoning greed, hate and delusion,<br>
understanding aright, with mind well-released,<br>
that one, unattached here and hereafter,<br>
<span class='add'>surely</span> partakes of the ascetic life.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about Heedfulness</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21' data-uid='dhp21'></a>Heedfulness is the deathless state, heedlessness the state of the dead,<br>
the heedful do not die, <span class='add'>but</span> those who are heedless are as if dead.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc22' data-uid='dhp22'></a>The wise, understanding this difference in regard to heedfulness,<br>
rejoice in heedfulness, delight in the domain of the Noble Ones.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc23' data-uid='dhp23'></a>Those who meditate all the time, constant and firm in their effort,<br>
those wise ones reach Nibbāna, the unsurpassed release from <span class='add'>all</span> bonds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc24' data-uid='dhp24'></a>For he who is active, mindful,<br>
pure in deeds, considerate,<br>
self-controlled, living by Dhamma,<br>
heedful, fame greatly increases.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc25' data-uid='dhp25'></a>Through activity, heedfulness, through self-control and through restraint,<br>
the sage should make an island that no flood waters can overcome.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc26' data-uid='dhp26'></a>The foolish and stupid people cultivate heedlessness,<br>
but the sagacious one guards heedfulness just as his greatest wealth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc27' data-uid='dhp27'></a>Do not cultivate heedlessness, do not be acquainted with delight in sensual pleasure,<br>
for the heedful one, meditating, <span class='add'>surely</span> attains great happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc28' data-uid='dhp28'></a>When the wise one eliminates heedlessness with his heedfulness,<br>
and mounts the palace of wisdom, griefless, <span class='add'>he looks</span> on grieving people;<br>
the wise one, like one standing on a mountain, looks down on the fools, who are standing on the plains.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc29' data-uid='dhp29'></a>Heedful amongst the heedless ones, wakeful amongst the ones who sleep,<br>
like a swift horse who abandons a weak horse, the true sage moves on.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc30' data-uid='dhp30'></a>Through heedfulness Maghavā attained leadership of the gods,<br>
<span class='add'>the good</span> praise heedfulness, <span class='add'>but</span> heedlessness is always blamed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc31' data-uid='dhp31'></a>A monastic who delights in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness,<br>
advances like burning fire against the fetter, small or large.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc32' data-uid='dhp32'></a>A monastic who delights in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness,<br>
is unable to fall away: he is well-nigh to Nibbāna.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about the Mind</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc33' data-uid='dhp33'></a>An agitated, unsteady mind, difficult to guard, difficult to ward,<br>
the sagacious one makes straight, as a fletcher does his arrow.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc34' data-uid='dhp34'></a>Like a fish thrown up on dry land, pulled out from its watery home,<br>
the mind is agitated, <span class='add'>one ought</span> to throw off the sway of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc35' data-uid='dhp35'></a>For the mind that is difficult to subdue, flighty, flitting wherever it will,<br>
restraint is good, a restrained mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc36' data-uid='dhp36'></a>Hard to see, very subtle, flitting wherever it will,<br>
the sage should guard the mind, a guarded mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc37' data-uid='dhp37'></a>Those who will restrain the mind that roams far,<br>
is lonesome, without a body, hidden, gain release from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc38' data-uid='dhp38'></a>For the one with unsettled mind, who does not know the True Dhamma,<br>
whose confidence is wavering, wisdom is unfulfilled.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc39' data-uid='dhp39'></a>For the one with mind free of lust, for the one with mind unperplexed,<br>
for the one who has abandoned making merit and demerit, for the watchful, there is no fear.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc40' data-uid='dhp40'></a>Knowing this body is <span class='add'>frail</span> like a jar,<br>
establishing the mind like a fortress,<br>
fight Māra with the weapon of wisdom,<br>
guard your success, and do not be attached.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc41' data-uid='dhp41'></a>Before long has passed by, alas, this body will lie on the ground,<br>
rejected, without consciousness, just like a useless piece of wood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc42' data-uid='dhp42'></a>Whatever an aggressor might do to an aggressor, or an enemy to an enemy –<br>
a mind that is badly-directed can do far worse than that to him.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc43' data-uid='dhp43'></a>Mother and father might not do for him, or other relatives,<br>
as much good as a mind that is well-directed can do for him.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about Flowers</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc44' data-uid='dhp44'></a>Who will know this earth<br>
and the lower realm, together with the gods?<br>
Who <span class='add'>will reflect</span> on the well-taught verse of Dhamma<br>
as a good man reflects on a flower?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc45' data-uid='dhp45'></a>The trainee will know this earth<br>
and the lower realm, together with the gods.<br>
The trainee <span class='add'>will reflect</span> on the well-taught verse of Dhamma<br>
as a good man reflects on a flower.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc46' data-uid='dhp46'></a>Knowing that this body is just like froth,<br>
understanding it has the nature of a mirage,<br>
cutting off Māra’s flower-tipped <span class='add'>arrows</span>,<br>
one should go beyond the King of Death’s sight.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc47' data-uid='dhp47'></a>Death takes up and carries away the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
like a great flood <span class='add'>carries off</span> a sleeping village.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc48' data-uid='dhp48'></a>The End-Maker takes control of the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
even though he is unsated with sense pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc49' data-uid='dhp49'></a>Just as a bee, without hurting the flower, its colour or scent,<br>
gathers its nectar and escapes, so should the seer roam in the village.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc50' data-uid='dhp50'></a>Not the wrongs of others, or what others have done or have not done<br>
one should consider, but what has been done and not done by oneself.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc51' data-uid='dhp51'></a>Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, but lacks fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitless for the one who acts not <span class='add'>on them</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc52' data-uid='dhp52'></a>Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, and has fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitful for the one who does act <span class='add'>on them</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc53' data-uid='dhp53'></a>Just as from a heap of flowers one might make a lot of garlands,<br>
so should many good deeds be done by one who is born a mortal.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc54' data-uid='dhp54'></a>The fragrance of flowers goes not against the wind,<br>
nor does sandalwood or pinwheel or white jasmine,<br>
but the fragrance of the good goes against the wind,<br>
the true person’s <span class='add'>fragrance</span> permeates all directions.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc55' data-uid='dhp55'></a>Sandalwood, pinwheel, then water lily and striped jasmine,<br>
amongst these kinds of fragrance virtue’s fragrance is unsurpassed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc56' data-uid='dhp56'></a>Pinwheel and sandalwood fragrance are insignificant,<br>
but the fragrance of one who has virtue flutters supreme amongst the gods.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc57' data-uid='dhp57'></a>Māra cannot find the path of those endowed with virtue, who live heedfully,<br>
and who are freed through complete and deep knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc58' data-uid='dhp58'></a>Just as in a forsaken and discarded heap along the highway<br>
a lotus might arise in that place, with a pure fragrance, delighting the mind,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc59' data-uid='dhp59'></a>so amongst the forsaken, the Perfect Sambuddha’s disciple<br>
outshines the blind and ordinary folk through his wisdom.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about Fools</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc60' data-uid='dhp60'></a>Long is the night for one awake, long is a league for one tired,<br>
long is the round of births and deaths for fools who know not True Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc61' data-uid='dhp61'></a>If while roaming one cannot find one better or the same as oneself,<br>
one should resolve to go alone: there is no friendship with fools.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc62' data-uid='dhp62'></a>“Sons are mine, riches are mine,” so the fool suffers vexation,<br>
when even self is not his own, how then sons, how then riches?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc63' data-uid='dhp63'></a>The fool who knows <span class='add'>his</span> foolishness, is at least wise in that <span class='add'>matter</span>,<br>
the fool who is proud of his wisdom, he is said to be a fool indeed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc64' data-uid='dhp64'></a>Even if a fool attends on a wise man for his whole life long,<br>
he does not learn Dhamma, just as spoon learns not the taste of curry.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc65' data-uid='dhp65'></a>If a perceptive man attends on a wise man even for a second,<br>
he quickly learns Dhamma, just as the tongue <span class='add'>learns</span> the taste of curry.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc66' data-uid='dhp66'></a>Stupid fools live having themselves as their own foes,<br>
committing wicked deeds, which produce bitter fruit.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc67' data-uid='dhp67'></a>That deed is not well done, which, having done, one has regret,<br>
for which he has tears on his face, as the result follows him round.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc68' data-uid='dhp68'></a>But that deed is well done, which, having done, one has no regret,<br>
for which he is pleased and happy, as the result follows him round.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc69' data-uid='dhp69'></a>The fool thinks it sweet, as long as the wicked deed does not ripen,<br>
but when the wicked deed ripens, the fool undergoes suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc70' data-uid='dhp70'></a>From month to month the fool may eat food with the tip of kusa-grass,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> he is not worth a sixteenth part of those who have mastered Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc71' data-uid='dhp71'></a>A wicked deed that has been done, like milk, does not turn all at once,<br>
smouldering, it follows the fool, like a fire covered with ashes.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc72' data-uid='dhp72'></a>As far as learning arises for a fool, it is only to his disadvantage,<br>
it destroys the fool’s good fortune, and it will destroy his head.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc73' data-uid='dhp73'></a>He may wish for the respect that is lacking, and status amongst the monastics,<br>
for control in the living quarters, and worship amongst good families:<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc74' data-uid='dhp74'></a>“Householders and renunciants should both think this was done by me,<br>
let them <span class='add'>all</span> be under my sway, in all to be done and not done”,<br>
so does the fool think, <span class='add'>meanwhile</span> his desires and conceit increase.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc75' data-uid='dhp75'></a>For the means to gains is one thing, the <span class='add'>path</span> going to Nibbāna another,<br>
thus knowing this the monastic disciple of the Buddha<br>
should not delight in honours, <span class='add'>but</span> practise in solitude.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about the Wise</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc76' data-uid='dhp76'></a>One should regard someone who shows your faults just like one who points out hidden treasure,<br>
one should keep company with such a sagacious, learned person who reproves you;<br>
keeping company with such is <span class='add'>surely</span> better for you, not worse.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc77' data-uid='dhp77'></a>One should advise and instruct, and forbid whatever is vile,<br>
for he is dear to the good, <span class='add'>but</span> he is not dear to the bad.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc78' data-uid='dhp78'></a>One should not keep company with wicked friends, one should not keep company with the ignoble,<br>
you should keep company with spiritual friends, you should keep company with superior people.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc79' data-uid='dhp79'></a>The one who drinks Dhamma lives well, with a clear mind,<br>
the wise one will always delight in the Dhamma that is made known by the Noble.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc80' data-uid='dhp80'></a>Course-makers lead water,<br>
fletchers straighten arrows,<br>
carpenters straighten wood,<br>
the wise master themselves.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc81' data-uid='dhp81'></a>Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind,<br>
so the wise are not moved by blame or praise.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc82' data-uid='dhp82'></a>Like a lake that is deep, clear and unruffled,<br>
just so the wise are confident after listening to Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc83' data-uid='dhp83'></a>True people surely everywhere renounce,<br>
the good do not talk of desiring sense-pleasures;<br>
when touched by pleasure or by suffering,<br>
the wise show neither elation or depression.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc84' data-uid='dhp84'></a>Not for one’s own sake and not for another’s sake,<br>
not desiring a child, riches, or a kingdom –<br>
he should not desire his success through corruption;<br>
he should be both virtuous and wise and righteous.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc85' data-uid='dhp85'></a>Amongst humans few people go beyond,<br>
the rest of the people run down the bank,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc86' data-uid='dhp86'></a>but those who live righteously, conforming with this well-taught Dhamma,<br>
those folk will go beyond the realm of death, which is very hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc87' data-uid='dhp87'></a>Having abandoned the dark state, the wise one should develop the bright,<br>
having gone forth to homelessness from home; in solitude, where it is hard to delight.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc88' data-uid='dhp88'></a>One should desire to delight in that place, having given up sense pleasures, and having no possessions,<br>
the wise one should purify the self of defilements of mind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc89' data-uid='dhp89'></a>For those who have well developed with right mind the factors of complete awakening,<br>
having given up grasping, those who delight in being unattached,<br>
pollutant-free, shining forth, are emancipated in the world.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about the Arahats</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc90' data-uid='dhp90'></a>For the one who has reached his goal, who grieves not, being released on all sides,<br>
who has abandoned all the knots, no consuming fever is found.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc91' data-uid='dhp91'></a>The mindful ones who are striving do not delight in a dwelling,<br>
like geese who abandon a lake, they abandon fondness for homes.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc92' data-uid='dhp92'></a>For those who have no stores, those who comprehend food aright,<br>
for those whose resort is the liberation that is empty or signless,<br>
like the birds in the sky, their track is hard to find.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc93' data-uid='dhp93'></a>For him whose pollutants are destroyed, who is not dependent on the foods,<br>
for him whose resort is the liberation that is empty or signless,<br>
like the birds in the sky, his footprint is hard to find.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc94' data-uid='dhp94'></a>For the one whose senses are stilled,<br>
like horses well-trained by their charioteer,<br>
who has abandoned conceit, who is without pollutants –<br>
even the gods envy such a one.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc95' data-uid='dhp95'></a>One untroubled just like the earth,<br>
steadfast just like a city-post,<br>
like a lake mud-free –<br>
such a one continues not in births and deaths.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc96' data-uid='dhp96'></a>His mind is calm, his speech and his actions are also calm,<br>
liberated by right knowledge, such a one is <span class='add'>truly</span> peaceful.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc97' data-uid='dhp97'></a>The person who is beyond <span class='add'>mere</span> faith, who knows that which is unmade, who has cut off <span class='add'>rebirth-</span>linking,<br>
who has destroyed the occasion, who has thrown out hope and desire, is surely the person supreme.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc98' data-uid='dhp98'></a>Whether in the village or wilds, whether on low or on high ground,<br>
wherever the Arahats live, that ground is <span class='add'>surely</span> delightful.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc99' data-uid='dhp99'></a>The delightful wildernesses where the people do not delight,<br>
those without passion will take delight, <span class='add'>but</span> not those who seek sense pleasures.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about the Thousands</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc100' data-uid='dhp100'></a>Though there are a thousand sayings consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one useful word hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc101' data-uid='dhp101'></a>Though there are a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one word of a verse hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc102' data-uid='dhp102'></a>One may speak a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc103' data-uid='dhp103'></a>One may conquer a thousand men a thousand times in a battle,<br>
but having conquered one’s own self, one would surely be supreme in battle.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc104' data-uid='dhp104'></a>Conquest over self is better than that over other people,<br>
for the person who conquers himself, who lives constantly well-restrained,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc105' data-uid='dhp105'></a>neither gods, nor gandhabbas, nor Māra together with Brahmās,<br>
can turn conquest into defeat for a person who is like this.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc106' data-uid='dhp106'></a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand <span class='add'>coins of money</span> month by month for a hundred <span class='add'>years</span>;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second –<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc107' data-uid='dhp107'></a>One person might care for the fire in the woods for a hundred years;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second –<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc108' data-uid='dhp108'></a>Whatever the alms or the sacrifice in the world<br>
the one seeking merit may give for a year,<br>
all that comes not to a quarter <span class='add'>of the merit</span> –<br>
better is the worship of the upright.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc109' data-uid='dhp109'></a>For the one who is constantly worshipping honourable elders,<br>
four things increase: the length of life, beauty, happiness, and strength.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc110' data-uid='dhp110'></a>One might live for a hundred years, unvirtuous and uncomposed,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one with virtue and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc111' data-uid='dhp111'></a>One might live for a hundred years, lacking in wisdom, uncomposed,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one endowed with wisdom and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc112' data-uid='dhp112'></a>One might live for a hundred years, indolent, with less energy,<br>

let him not place his intention in it, <span class='add'>for</span> there is an accumulation of suffering for the wicked one.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc118' data-uid='dhp118'></a>If a person should make merit, he should do it again and again,<br>
let him place his intention there, there is an increase of joy for the one who has made merit.</p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc133' data-uid='dhp133'></a>Do not say anything harsh, spoken to they might answer back to you,<br>

you are <span class='add'>like</span> one who has attained Nibbāna, contention is not found in you.</p>

you should be ardent and spiritually intense.<br>
Having faith, virtue and energy,<br>
concentration and investigation of the Dhamma.<br>
One who has understanding and good conduct, mindfulness,<br>
will abandon this not insignificant suffering.</p>

<h2>The Chapter about Old Age</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc146' data-uid='dhp146'></a>Why this laughter, why this joy, when the world is constantly burning,<br>
why, when enveloped by darkness, do you not seek for a light?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc147' data-uid='dhp147'></a>See this beautified manikin, a heap of sores that is raised up,<br>
sick, imagined in many ways, which has nothing stable or firm.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc148' data-uid='dhp148'></a>This body is worn out, a nest of disease, perishing,<br>
the putrid body comes to destruction, for life ends in death.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc149' data-uid='dhp149'></a>Like discarded white gourds thrown away in autumn<br>
are these grey bones; seeing them, why is there delight?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc150' data-uid='dhp150'></a>This fortress is made out of bones,<br>
plastered over with flesh and blood,<br>
but hidden within lie old age,<br>
death, also conceit and anger.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc151' data-uid='dhp151'></a>Decorated royal chariots decay,<br>
and the body also decays,<br>
but the good Dhamma does not decay,<br>
the good surely pass it on to the good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc152' data-uid='dhp152'></a>The person of little learning increases in age like an ox,<br>
<span class='add'>for although</span> his flesh does increase, his wisdom does not increase.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc153' data-uid='dhp153'></a>Through the round of countless births and deaths I have wandered without finding<br>
the housebuilder I was seeking: born and suffering once again.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc154' data-uid='dhp154'></a>O housebuilder, now you are seen! You will not build the house again:<br>
all your rafters have been broken, and the ridgepole has been destroyed,<br>
my mind has reached the unconditioned, and craving’s end has been achieved.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc155' data-uid='dhp155'></a>Not having lived the holy life, not having gained wealth in their youth,<br>

<h2>The Chapter about the Self</h2>

during one of the three watches <span class='add'>of the night</span> the wise one should stay alert.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc158' data-uid='dhp158'></a>First one should establish oneself in what is suitable,<br>
then one can advise another, the wise one should not have <span class='add'>any</span> defilement.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc159' data-uid='dhp159'></a>He should do himself as he would advise another <span class='add'>to do</span>,<br>
being well-trained, he could surely train <span class='add'>another</span>, for it is said the self is difficult to train.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc160' data-uid='dhp160'></a>For the self is the friend of self, for what other friend would there be?<br>
When the self is well-trained, one finds a friend that is hard to find.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc161' data-uid='dhp161'></a>That wickedness done by oneself, born in oneself, arising in oneself,<br>
crushes the one who is stupid, as a diamond <span class='add'>crushes</span> a rock-jewel.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc162' data-uid='dhp162'></a>The one who has an exceeding lack of virtue, like a deadly creeper covering a Sal tree,<br>
makes himself the same as his enemy wishes him to be.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc163' data-uid='dhp163'></a>Easily done are things not good, and unbeneficial for oneself,<br>
but that which is beneficial and good is supremely hard to do.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc164' data-uid='dhp164'></a>Whoever reviles the worthy teaching of the Noble Ones who live by Dhamma,<br>
that stupid one, depending on wicked views,<br>
like the bamboo when it bears fruit, brings about his own destruction.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc165' data-uid='dhp165'></a>By oneself alone is a wicked deed done, by oneself is one defiled,<br>
by oneself is a wicked deed left undone, by oneself is one purified,<br>
purity and impurity come from oneself, <span class='add'>for</span> no one can purify another.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc166' data-uid='dhp166'></a>One should not neglect one’s own good for another’s, however great;<br>
knowing what is good for oneself one should be intent on that good.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about the World</h2>

looking on the world in this way the King of Death does not see <span class='add'>one</span>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc171' data-uid='dhp171'></a>Come, look upon this world adorned like a king’s gilded chariot,<br>
where fools become depressed – there is no bond for those who understand.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc172' data-uid='dhp172'></a>Whoever was heedless before, but later is not heedless,<br>
that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc173' data-uid='dhp173'></a>The one whose wicked deed is covered over by a good deed –<br>
that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc174' data-uid='dhp174'></a>This world is blind, few here have true insight,<br>
as few go to heaven as birds that escape from the net.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc175' data-uid='dhp175'></a>Geese go through the path of the sky, they go through the firmament by their power,<br>
the wise are led out of the world, after beating Māra and his host.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc176' data-uid='dhp176'></a>For the person speaking falsely, who has transgressed in this one thing,<br>
who has abandoned the next world, there is no wickedness left undone.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc177' data-uid='dhp177'></a>The miserly go not to the world of the gods,<br>
fools surely do not praise giving,<br>
but the wise one rejoices in giving,<br>
and through that he is happy hereafter.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc178' data-uid='dhp178'></a>Having sole sovereignty over the earth, or going to heaven,<br>

<a class='sc' id='sc226' data-uid='dhp226'></a>For those who are always wakeful, who train both by day and by night,<br>
who are intent on Nibbāna, the pollutants are laid to rest.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc227' data-uid='dhp227'></a>This is something of old, Atula, this is not something of today:<br>
they blame the one who sits silently, they blame the one who talks a lot,<br>
they blame the one who talks in moderation, there is no one in the world not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc228' data-uid='dhp228'></a>There was not and there will not be, and at present there is not found<br>
a person totally blameworthy, or one totally praiseworthy.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc229' data-uid='dhp229'></a>The one who, after being examined day by day, is praised by the wise,<br>
faultless in conduct, sagacious, attending to virtue and wisdom,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc230' data-uid='dhp230'></a>one who is like a golden coin, who is there worthy to blame him?<br>
That one is praised by the gods, and has been praised by the Brahmās too.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc231' data-uid='dhp231'></a>One should guard against bodily anger, one should be restrained bodily,<br>
abandoning wrong bodily conduct, one should have good bodily conduct.</p>

<h2>The Chapter about Stains</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc235' data-uid='dhp235'></a>You are now like a withered leaf,<br>
Yama’s men stand waiting for you,<br>
you stand at decay’s door,<br>
with no provisions for the journey found.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc236' data-uid='dhp236'></a>One should make an island for oneself,<br>
soon the wise one should endeavour,<br>
removing the stain, blemishless,<br>
you will go to the divine and noble realm.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc237' data-uid='dhp237'></a>You are now advanced in age,<br>
you have come to Yama’s presence,<br>
there is nowhere to dwell in between,<br>
with no provisions for the journey found.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc238' data-uid='dhp238'></a>One should make an island for oneself,<br>
soon the wise one should endeavour,<br>
removing the stain, blemishless,<br>
you will not come to birth and old age again.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc239' data-uid='dhp239'></a>The sage gradually, little by little, moment by moment,<br>
should remove the stain from himself, like a smith <span class='add'>removes the stain</span> from silver.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc240' data-uid='dhp240'></a>As a <span class='add'>rust</span> stain arises from iron,<br>
and arisen from that, it eats it away,<br>
so with one who is overindulgent –<br>
his deeds lead him to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc241' data-uid='dhp241'></a>Lack of repetition is the ruin of chants, a lack of maintenance is the ruin of homes,<br>
indolence is the ruin of one’s appearance, heedlessness is the ruin of the one on guard.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc242' data-uid='dhp242'></a>Bad conduct is a woman’s stain, stinginess is a giver’s stain,<br>
wicked actions are indeed stains both in this world and in the next.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc243' data-uid='dhp243'></a>A stain that is worse than that stain, ignorance is the supreme stain,<br>
after abandoning that stain, be without stains, O monastics!</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc244' data-uid='dhp244'></a>Life is light for one without shame, with the bold courage of a crow,<br>
living a life with backbiting, recklessness, and defilements.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc245' data-uid='dhp245'></a>Life is hard when endowed with shame, for the one constantly seeking purity,<br>

takes what is not given here, and goes to another’s wife,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc247' data-uid='dhp247'></a>that person who is devoted to a drink of liquor and wine,<br>
digs up his own root right here in the world.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc248' data-uid='dhp248'></a>Know it thus, dear sir, a lack of restraint is a bad thing,<br>
let not greed and corruption oppress you with suffering for a long time.</p>

herein the one who becomes dejected because of food and drink <span class='add'>given</span> to others<br>
he does not, either by day or nigh attain to <span class='add'>good</span> concentration.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc250' data-uid='dhp250'></a>For the one in whom this <span class='add'>dejection</span> is cut off, destroyed at the root, dug up,<br>
does, by day and night, attain to <span class='add'>good</span> concentration.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc251' data-uid='dhp251'></a>There is no fire that is like passion, there is nothing that takes a hold like hatred,<br>

for one sifts other peoples’ faults like they were chaff,<br>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc253' data-uid='dhp253'></a>The one who constantly looks for another’s fault, who is an abject complainer,<br>

<h2>The Chapter about one who stands by Dhamma</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc256' data-uid='dhp256'></a>One who would hastily settle a case because of that is not one who stands by Dhamma,<br>
the wise one should discriminate the two: what is the case and what is not the case.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc257' data-uid='dhp257'></a>The one who settles for other people without haste, justly and impartially,<br>
the sagacious one, protecting Dhamma, is said to be one who stands by Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc258' data-uid='dhp258'></a>One is not a wise person merely because of speaking much;<br>
being safe, hatred-free, fearless, one is called a wise person.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc259' data-uid='dhp259'></a>One is not a Dhamma-bearer merely through speaking much,<br>
but the one who, having heard a little, sees Dhamma for himself,<br>
is one who bears Dhamma, the one who is not heedless regarding Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc260' data-uid='dhp260'></a>One is not an elder because one’s head has grey hair,<br>
for the one who is <span class='add'>only</span> well-matured, aged, is said to be old in vain.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc261' data-uid='dhp261'></a>In whom is truth, Dhamma, non-violence, restraint and <span class='add'>good</span> training,<br>
the wise one who throws out the stain is <span class='add'>truly</span> called an elder.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc262' data-uid='dhp262'></a>Not by eloquence only, or by a beautiful complexion,<br>
is a person honourable, <span class='add'>if still</span> jealous, selfish and deceitful;<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc263' data-uid='dhp263'></a>for the one in whom this is cut off, destroyed at the root, dug up,<br>
that sage who has thrown out hatred is said to be honourable.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc264' data-uid='dhp264'></a>Not through a shaven head is one an ascetic, <span class='add'>if</span> one lacks vows, speaks lies,<br>
and is endowed with greed and desire, how will one be an ascetic?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc265' data-uid='dhp265'></a>The one who pacifies wicked deeds, small and great, in every way –<br>
through the pacifing of wicked deeds he is said to be an ascetic.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc266' data-uid='dhp266'></a>One is not a monastic merely through eating others’ almsfood,<br>
the one who undertakes a false Dhamma to that extent is not a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc267' data-uid='dhp267'></a>If he is one who lives the holy life here, warding off both merit and demerit,<br>
and wanders with discrimination in the world, that one is said to be a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc268' data-uid='dhp268'></a>Not through silence is a deluded fool <span class='add'>considered to be</span> a seer,<br>
the wise one, like one holding the balance, takes up what is noble.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc269' data-uid='dhp269'></a>The seer who rejects wicked deeds through that is <span class='add'>considered</span> a seer,<br>
whoever understands both worlds because of that is said to be a seer.</p>

the one who does not hurt any breathing beings is said to be noble.</p>

let a monastic not be confident <span class='add'>as long as</span> the destruction of the pollutants is unattained.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about the Path</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc273' data-uid='dhp273'></a>The eightfold is the best of paths, four principles <span class='add'>the best</span> of truths,<br>
passionlessness the best of states, the Visionary <span class='add'>the best</span> of men.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc274' data-uid='dhp274'></a>This is the path, there is no other, for insight and for purity,<br>
you should enter upon this path, this is the confounding of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc275' data-uid='dhp275'></a>Having entered upon this path you will make an end to suffering,<br>
the path was declared by me, the removal of the dart by knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc276' data-uid='dhp276'></a>Your duty is to have ardour declare the Realised Ones,<br>
entering this path meditators will be released from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc277' data-uid='dhp277'></a>All conditions are impermanent, when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering – this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc278' data-uid='dhp278'></a>All conditions are suffering, when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering – this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc279' data-uid='dhp279'></a>All components <span class='add'>of mind and body</span> are without self, when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering – this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc280' data-uid='dhp280'></a>The one who has not energy at a time for energy,<br>
youthful, strong, <span class='add'>but</span> given to laziness,<br>
whose mind lacks <span class='add'>right</span> intention and is indolent –<br>
the lazy one does not find wisdom’s path.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc281' data-uid='dhp281'></a>Verbally guarded, well-restrained in mind,<br>
not doing a wrong deed with the body,<br>
one should purify these three paths of action,<br>
one should undertake the path shown by seers.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc282' data-uid='dhp282'></a>From effort arises wisdom, without effort wisdom is destroyed,<br>
having understood these two paths of development and decline,<br>
one should establish oneself so that one’s wisdom increases.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc283' data-uid='dhp283'></a>Cut down the forest <span class='add'>of defilements</span> not just a tree, from the forest arises a danger,<br>
having cut down the forest and thicket, you should be without forests, monastics.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc284' data-uid='dhp284'></a>For as long as an atom of desire<br>
of a man for a woman is not cut down,<br>
for just so long is the mind in bondage,<br>
like a calf <span class='add'>in bondage</span> to mother’s milk.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc285' data-uid='dhp285'></a>Cut off <span class='add'>any</span> affection for one’s self,<br>
like an autumn lotus <span class='add'>plucked</span> with the hand,<br>
develop fully the path to peace and<br>
Nibbāna taught by the Fortunate One.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc286' data-uid='dhp286'></a>“Here I will dwell during the rains, here during winter and summer”,<br>
in just such a way a fool thinks, not understanding the danger.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc287' data-uid='dhp287'></a>That person whose mind is attached and besotted by cattle and children,<br>
is snatched away by death just as a sleeping village <span class='add'>by</span> a great flood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc288' data-uid='dhp288'></a>Children are not a refuge, nor fathers, not even kin,<br>
for one overcome by the End-Maker there is no refuge in relatives.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc289' data-uid='dhp289'></a>Understanding the truth of this the wise one, endowed with virtue,<br>
should quickly purify the path that is leading to Nibbāna.</p>
<h2>The Miscellaneous Chapter</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc290' data-uid='dhp290'></a>If, by renouncing a small good, he might see a good that is large,<br>
the wise one should renounce that small good, seeing the good that is extensive.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc291' data-uid='dhp291'></a>One who desires happiness for oneself by causing suffering for another,<br>
being associated thus with hatred, is not fully released from that hatred.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc292' data-uid='dhp292'></a>That to be done is rejected, but what is not to be done is done,<br>
for the insolent, the heedless, their pollutants increase.</p>

who do not practice what is not to be done, persisting in what is to be done,<br>
for those mindful ones, those fully aware, the pollutants are laid to rest.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc294' data-uid='dhp294'></a>Destroying mother and father, and <span class='add'>then</span> two noble kings,<br>

dwelling together with those different is suffering, travellers <span class='add'>in the round of births</span> are affected by suffering,<br>
therefore do not be a traveller, do not be affected by suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc303' data-uid='dhp303'></a>The faithful one who is endowed with virtue, and has wealth and fame,<br>
whatever district he resorts to, right there and then he is worshipped.</p>

<h2>The Chapter about the Underworld</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc306' data-uid='dhp306'></a>The one who speaks falsely goes to the underworld,<br>
and he who says: ‘I did not do’ what he has done,<br>
both of these are just the same when they have gone<br>
to the hereafter, <span class='add'>they are</span> humans who did base deeds.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc307' data-uid='dhp307'></a>Many wearing the monastic robe around their necks are wicked, unrestrained,<br>
the wicked through their wicked deeds re-arisein the underworld.</p>

than that <span class='add'>the monastic</span> who is unrestrained and unvirtuous should enjoy the country’s almsfood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc309' data-uid='dhp309'></a>There are four states the man who is heedless,<br>
the man who consorts with other man’s wives, undergoes:<br>
he gains demerit, an uncomfortable bed,<br>
blame as third, and <span class='add'>rebirth in</span> the underworld as fourth.</p>

a man therefore should not consort with another’s wife.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc311' data-uid='dhp311'></a>As jagged grass, wrongly grasped, cuts into the hand,<br>

amongst humans one trained is best, the one who can endure abuse.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc322' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Noble are the well-trained horses, the well-bred horses from Sindh,<br>
and the great tusker elephants, <span class='add'>and even</span> more noble than that is the one who has trained himself.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc323' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Not by these vehicles can one go to the place beyond destinations,<br>

musty in rut, difficult to restrain,<br>

one should live alone and not do anything bad,<br>
unconcerned like a solitary elephant in the forest.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc331' data-uid='dhp1'></a>Friends are good whenever need arises,<br>
being content with everything is good,<br>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc336' data-uid='dhp336'></a>Whoever overcomes this low craving in the world, which is difficult to get past,<br>
griefs fall from him like a drop of water from a lotus.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc337' data-uid='dhp337'></a>This I say to you: “Good luck to as many as have assembled here”,<br>
dig up the root of craving, like one seeking the root <span class='add'>digs up</span> grass,<br>
do not let Māra push you down again like a stream <span class='add'>pushes down</span> the reed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc338' data-uid='dhp338'></a>Just as when the root remains firm and untroubled<br>
though the tree was cut down, it grows again,<br>
so when the tendency to craving is not rooted out<br>
this suffering appears again and again.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc339' data-uid='dhp339'></a>He in whom the thirty-six streams flow pleasantly and strong,<br>
the one with wrong view, is carried away by his passionate intentions.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc340' data-uid='dhp340'></a>Streams are flowing everywhere, the creepers remain where they grow,<br>
seeing this, cut the creeper’s root that has arisen with wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc341' data-uid='dhp341'></a>There are flowing streams of affection and<br>
mental happinesses for a person,<br>
pleasure-dependent they seek happiness,<br>
those people undergo both birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc342' data-uid='dhp342'></a>People surrounded by craving<br>
crawl round like a hare in a trap,<br>
attached and clinging to fetters<br>
they come back again and again to suffering for a long time.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc343' data-uid='dhp343'></a>People surrounded by craving<br>
crawl round like a hare in a trap,<br>
therefore he should remove craving –<br>
the monk who longs for dispassion for himself.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc344' data-uid='dhp344'></a>The one who is free from desires, who is intent on the forest,<br>
<span class='add'>though</span> free from the forest, runs back to the forest,<br>
come here and look at that person,<br>
<span class='add'>though</span> free, he runs back to bondage.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc345' data-uid='dhp345'></a>That bondage is not so strong say the wise,<br>
that is made of iron or wood or reeds,<br>
impassioned and excited they seek out<br>
jewels and earrings and children and wives –<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc346' data-uid='dhp346'></a>that bondage is strong say the wise,<br>
dragging down the lax, hard to get free from,<br>
having cut this down they wander about<br>
seeking nothing, abandoning the happiness in pleasure.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc347' data-uid='dhp347'></a>Those who are impassioned by passion follow the stream<br>
like a spider a web made by itself,<br>
having cut this away the wise proceed,<br>
seeking nothing, abandoning all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc348' data-uid='dhp348'></a>Be free of the past, be free of the future,<br>
be free of the present, after crossing over <span class='add'>all</span> existence,<br>
with mind liberated in every way,<br>
you will not return to birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc349' data-uid='dhp349'></a>For a person crushed by thoughts<br>
and pierced by passion, contemplating the attractive,<br>
craving increases much more,<br>
this surely makes the bond more firm.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc350' data-uid='dhp350'></a>Whoever has delight in the calming of thoughts,<br>
who always mindfully cultivates what is unattractive,<br>
will surely abolish this <span class='add'>craving</span>,<br>
he will cut off the bond of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc351' data-uid='dhp351'></a>Having gone to the end, without trembling, without craving, without impurity,<br>
cutting off the darts of existence, this one is his final body.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc352' data-uid='dhp352'></a>Without craving, without attachment, skilled in words and their explanation,<br>
knowing how syllables are arranged, which come before and which after,<br>
the one in his final body is said to be <span class='add'>a great person</span>, one of great wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc353' data-uid='dhp353'></a>All-Conquering, All-Wise am I,<br>
undefiled regarding all things,<br>
having given up everything, liberated through craving’s destruction,<br>
when having deep knowledge myself, who should I point to <span class='add'>as Teacher</span>?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc354' data-uid='dhp354'></a>The gift of the Dhamma surpasses all other gifts,<br>
the taste of the Dhamma surpasses all other tastes,<br>
the love of the Dhamma surpasses all other loves,<br>
destruction of craving overcomes all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc355' data-uid='dhp355'></a>Riches destroy the stupid one who does not seek the way beyond,<br>
through his craving for riches the stupid one destroys others and himself.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc356' data-uid='dhp356'></a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds, these people are ruined by passion,<br>
therefore there is great fruit for that given to those without passion.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc357' data-uid='dhp357'></a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds, these people are ruined by hatred,<br>
therefore there is great fruit for that given to those without hatred.</p>

therefore there is great fruit for that given to those without desire.</p>
<h2>The Chapter about Monastics</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc360' data-uid='dhp360'></a>Restraint of eye is good, restraint of ear is good,<br>
restraint of nose is good, restraint of tongue is good,<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc361' data-uid='dhp361'></a>restraint of body is good, restraint of speech is good,<br>
restraint of mind is good, restraint is everywhere good,<br>
a monastic who is restrained everywhere is liberated from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc362' data-uid='dhp362'></a>One who controls his hands, controls his feet,<br>
controls his speech, controls the <span class='add'>mind</span> supreme,<br>
with inner delight and composure,<br>
solitary, content: that one is called a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc363' data-uid='dhp363'></a>That monastic who restrains the mouth, who speaks well, and who is modest,<br>
who explains the meaning of the Dhamma, his speech is sweet.</p>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc365' data-uid='dhp365'></a>One should not despise one’s own gains, one should not live envious of others,<br>

even the very gods praise the one of pure life who is diligent.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc367' data-uid='dhp367'></a>The one who does not have fondness at all for mind and body,<br>

should attain the state of peace, the joy in stilling of <span class='add'>all</span> conditions.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc369' data-uid='dhp369'></a>Please bail out this boat, monastic, when bailed out it will go lightly,<br>
cutting off passion and hatred, from here one will go to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc370' data-uid='dhp370'></a>One should cut off five, one should abandon five, one should cultivate five more,<br>
the monastic who surmounts five attachments is called a flood-crosser.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc371' data-uid='dhp371'></a>Meditate, monastic, do not be heedless,<br>
do not let your mind swirl around in strands of desire,<br>
do not, heedless, swallow a <span class='add'>hot</span> iron ball,<br>
do not, while burning, cry: ‘This is suffering.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc372' data-uid='dhp372'></a>There is no concentration for one without wisdom, there is no wisdom for one without concentration,<br>
the one who has both concentration and wisdom is indeed in the presence of Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc373' data-uid='dhp373'></a>For the one who has entered an empty place, a monastic with a peaceful mind,<br>
there is superhuman delight from insight into true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc374' data-uid='dhp374'></a>Whoever has right mindfulness regarding the rise and fall of the components <span class='add'>of mind and body</span><br>
gains joy and happiness, that is the deathless state for the one who knows.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc375' data-uid='dhp375'></a>This is the very beginning for the wise monastic here:<br>
contentment, guarding the senses, and restraint in the regulations.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc376' data-uid='dhp376'></a>One should resort to spiritual friends, ones of pure life, ones who are diligent,<br>
one should be of friendly disposition, one who will be skilful in his conduct,<br>
rejoicing frequently because of that, one will make an end to suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc377' data-uid='dhp377'></a>Just as striped jasmine casts off its withered flowers,<br>
so, monastics, cast off <span class='add'>all</span> passion and hatred.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc378' data-uid='dhp378'></a>Calm in body and calm in speech, having calmness and composure,<br>
having thrown off worldly gain the monastic is called one at peace.</p>

he who guards himself, mindful, will live happily, monastic.<br>
<a class='sc' id='sc380' data-uid='dhp380'></a>Self is the protector of self, self is the refuge of self,<br>
