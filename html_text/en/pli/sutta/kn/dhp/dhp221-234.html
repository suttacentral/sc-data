<h1>Anger</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp221" id="221"></a>One should give up anger, renounce pride, and overcome all fetters. Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp222" id="222"></a>He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot, him I call a true charioteer. Others only hold the reins.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp223" id="223"></a>Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp224" id="224"></a>Speak the truth; yield not to anger; when asked, give even if you only have a little. By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp225" id="225"></a>Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body, go to the Deathless State, where, having gone, they grieve no more.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp226" id="226"></a>Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night, and are ever intent upon Nibbana—their defilements fade away.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp227" id="227"></a>O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp228" id="228"></a>There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp229" id="229"></a>But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp230" id="230"></a>Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp231" id="231"></a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed. Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp232" id="232"></a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp233" id="233"></a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp234" id="234"></a>The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.</p>
