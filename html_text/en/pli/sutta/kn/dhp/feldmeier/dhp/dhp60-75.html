<h1 class='sutta'>The Fool</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc60' data-uid='dhp60'>SC 60</a>Long is the night for the wakeful,<br>
Long is a trek for the weary,<br>
Long is samsara for fools,<br>
Who do not understand the true Dhamma.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc61' data-uid='dhp61'>SC 61</a>If a traveler should not find another better or equal<br>
to himself,<br>
Then he should resolutely travel alone.<br>
With fools there is no companionship.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc62' data-uid='dhp62'>SC 62</a>The fool worries: “I have sons, I have wealth.” He does not even possess himself.<br>
How then sons? How then wealth?<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc63' data-uid='dhp63'>SC 63</a>A fool who considers himself foolish is,<br>
In this, like a sage.<br>
But a fool who is proud of his cleverness<br>
Is truly called fool.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc64' data-uid='dhp64'>SC 64</a>A fool who spends a lifetime attending on a sage,<br>
Will not apprehend the Dhamma,<br>
Just as a spoon can never know the soup’s flavor.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc65' data-uid='dhp65'>SC 65</a>An intelligent person who attends on a sage,<br>
Even for a moment,<br>
Will quickly apprehend the Dhamma,<br>
Like the tongue perceiving the soup’s flavor.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc66' data-uid='dhp66'>SC 66</a>Thoughtless fools act as their own enemies,<br>
Doing evil deeds that bear bitter fruit.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc67' data-uid='dhp67'>SC 67</a>That deed is not well-done,<br>
Which one regrets when accomplished,<br>
Which results in crying and a tear-streaked face.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc68' data-uid='dhp68'>SC 68</a>That deed is well-done,<br>
Which one does not regret when accomplished,<br>
Which results in delight and joy.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc69' data-uid='dhp69'>SC 69</a>As long as evil has not ripened,<br>
The fool thinks it honey;<br>
When evil ripens, the fool suffers.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc70' data-uid='dhp70'>SC 70</a>Though month after month<br>
He may eat his food with the tip of the grass blade,<br>
The fool is not worth a fraction<br>
Of one who has realized the Dhamma.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc71' data-uid='dhp71'>SC 71</a>Indeed, like fresh milk,<br>
An evil deed does not immediately curdle.<br>
Burning, it follows the fool,<br>
Like a fire concealed by ashes.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc72' data-uid='dhp72'>SC 72</a>Only to his detriment does knowledge arise in the<br>
fool.<br>
It destroys his good fortune and splits his head.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc73' data-uid='dhp73'>SC 73</a>He seeks undue respect, honor among monks,<br>
Authority in monasteries, and devotion by families<br>
not his own.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc74' data-uid='dhp74'>SC 74</a>“Let both householder and monk think that alone I have done this,<br>
Let them be under my will in every task.” So thinks the fool, whose desire and pride grow.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc75' data-uid='dhp75'>SC 75</a>There is one path to worldly gains,<br>
And a very different path to Nibbāna.<br>
Let the monk who knows this,<br>
The disciple of the Awakened One,<br>
Not rejoice in honor, but cultivate solitude.<br></p>
