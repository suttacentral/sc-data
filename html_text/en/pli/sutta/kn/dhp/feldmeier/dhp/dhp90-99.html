<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc90' data-uid='dhp90' href='#sc90' data-uid='dhp90'>SC 90</a>There is no fever for one<br>
Who has completed the journey,<br>
Who is without sorrow,<br>
Who has abandoned all fetters,<br>
Who is freed in every way.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc91' data-uid='dhp91' href='#sc91' data-uid='dhp91'>SC 91</a>Those who are mindful depart;<br>
They do not delight in a house.<br>
They leave behind every home,<br>
Like geese who abandon a pond.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc92' data-uid='dhp92' href='#sc92' data-uid='dhp92'>SC 92</a>The one who is not acquisitive,<br>
Who knows well the role of food,<br>
Whose field is empty, unmarked freedom,<br>
Is like a bird in the sky<br>
Whose destination is difficult to discern.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc93' data-uid='dhp93' href='#sc93' data-uid='dhp93'>SC 93</a>The one who has destroyed all toxins,<br>
Who is unattached to food,<br>
Whose field is empty, unmarked freedom,<br>
Is like a bird in the sky<br>
Whose path is difficult to discern.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc94' data-uid='dhp94' href='#sc94' data-uid='dhp94'>SC 94</a>One whose senses are as calm<br>
As horses well-tamed by a charioteer,<br>
Who has abandoned pride and is free from toxins,<br>
Is envied even by the gods.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc95' data-uid='dhp95' href='#sc95' data-uid='dhp95'>SC 95</a>For one who, like the earth, does not oppose,<br>
Who is like a pillar of Indra,<br>
Who is deeply devout,<br>
Who is like a deep unclouded pond,<br>
There is no more wandering.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc96' data-uid='dhp96' href='#sc96' data-uid='dhp96'>SC 96</a>Calm is the mind, speech, and action<br>
Of such a one freed by right understanding.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc97' data-uid='dhp97' href='#sc97' data-uid='dhp97'>SC 97</a>The one who is faithless [beyond believing], Who is ungrateful [knows the Uncreated], Who is a burglar [severs connections], Who destroys opportunities [breaks the chain of<br>
rebirth], Who is despondent [throws off desire]: This is the ultimate person.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc98' data-uid='dhp98' href='#sc98' data-uid='dhp98'>SC 98</a>Whether in the village, forest, valley, or highland,<br>
Wherever the arahants dwell is a place of delight.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc99' data-uid='dhp99' href='#sc99' data-uid='dhp99'>SC 99</a>Delightful are the forests where few find delight.<br>
There, those who seek no sensual pleasures,<br>
Who are free of passion, will delight.<br></p>
