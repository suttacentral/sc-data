<p><a class='sc' id='sc320' data-uid='dhp320'></a>As an elephant in battle endures arrows shot from<br>
bows,<br>
So shall I endure insult.<br>
Truly, the masses are immoral.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc321' data-uid='dhp321'></a>It is the tamed one they lead into the crowd.<br>
It is the tamed one that the king mounts.<br>
Among humans, best is the tamed one<br>
Who endures insult.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc322' data-uid='dhp322'></a>Excellent are tamed mules,<br>
Thoroughbred horses of Sindh, and great elephants,<br>
tuskers.<br>
More excellent than these is the one who tames<br>
himself.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc323' data-uid='dhp323'></a>For not by these mounts could one go to the<br>
unreached region,<br>
As one tamed goes well-tamed.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc324' data-uid='dhp324'></a>A tusker named Dhanapālaka,<br>
Bound, difficult to restrain, and rutting,<br>
Does not eat even a morsel;<br>
He longs for the elephant grove.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc325' data-uid='dhp325'></a>The sluggish and gluttonous,<br>
The sleeper, who lies rolling around,<br>
Being dull like a great boar nourished on fodder,<br>
Undergoes rebirth again and again.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc326' data-uid='dhp326'></a>Formerly, this mind went wandering as it wished,<br>
According to its desire and pleasure.<br>
Today, I will restrain it thoroughly,<br>
As an elephant driver subdues a rutting elephant.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc327' data-uid='dhp327'></a>Be devoted to vigilance;<br>
Guard your mind.<br>
Raise yourself from the bad path,<br>
Like a tusker sunk in mud.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc328' data-uid='dhp328'></a>If you should find an intelligent companion,<br>
A fellow-traveler who is wise and virtuous,<br>
You should journey together, joyful and mindful,<br>
Overcoming all dangers.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc329' data-uid='dhp329'></a>If you should not find an intelligent companion,<br>
A fellow-traveler who is wise and virtuous,<br>
Then journey alone,<br>
Like a king who has abandoned a conquered<br>
kingdom,<br>
Like the elephant in the Mātaṅga forest.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc330' data-uid='dhp330'></a>It is better to travel alone; there is no<br>
companionship with a fool.<br>
Go alone, wanting little, and doing no wrong,<br>
Like the elephant in the Mātaṅga forest.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc331' data-uid='dhp331'></a>Happy are friends when need arises.<br>
Happy is contentment in whatever is.<br>
Happy is a meritorious deed at the end of life.<br>
Happy is the abandonment of suffering altogether.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc332' data-uid='dhp332'></a>Happy in this world is reverence toward one’s<br>
mother,<br>
And reverence for one’s father as well.<br>
Happy in this world is reverence toward a<br>
renunciant.<br>
Happy is respect for the brahmin.<br></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc333' data-uid='dhp333'></a>Happy is virtue through old age.<br>
Happy is a firmly established faith.<br>
Happy is the attainment of wisdom.<br>
Happy is doing no wrong.<br></p>
