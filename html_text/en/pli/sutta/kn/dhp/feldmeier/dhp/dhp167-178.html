<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc167' href='#sc167' data-uid='dhp167'>SC 167</a>Do not follow an inferior teaching;<br>
Do not live by negligence;<br>
Do not embrace wrong views;<br>
Do not be a world-enhancer.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc168' href='#sc168' data-uid='dhp168'>SC 168</a>Arise and be not negligent.<br>
Follow the Dhamma, practice well.<br>
Happy the one who dwells in Dhamma,<br>
Both in this world and in the next.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc169' href='#sc169' data-uid='dhp169'>SC 169</a>Practice the Dhamma well, not poorly.<br>
Happy the one who dwells in Dhamma,<br>
Both in this world and in the next.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc170' href='#sc170' data-uid='dhp170'>SC 170</a>Look upon the world as a bubble;<br>
Look upon the world as a mirage.<br>
One who looks thus is unseen by the<br>
king of Death.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc171' href='#sc171' data-uid='dhp171'>SC 171</a>Come, look at this world as an adorned king’s<br>
chariot.<br>
While fools sink down, the discriminating are free.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc172' href='#sc172' data-uid='dhp172'>SC 172</a>One who was once negligent but becomes diligent,<br>
Illumines the world,<br>
Like a moon released from a cloud.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc173' href='#sc173' data-uid='dhp173'>SC 173</a>One whose evil conduct is replaced by good,<br>
Illumines the world,<br>
Like a moon released from a cloud.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc174' href='#sc174' data-uid='dhp174'>SC 174</a>Blind is this world where few see clearly.<br>
As birds who escape from the snare are few,<br>
So too are those who go to a higher plane.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc175' href='#sc175' data-uid='dhp175'>SC 175</a>Geese travel by the path of the sun,<br>
By power they move through the sky.<br>
The wise are led from the world,<br>
Having conquered Māra and his army.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc176' href='#sc176' data-uid='dhp176'>SC 176</a>Of the one who has transgressed the law,<br>
Rejected the world beyond,<br>
And speaks falsely:<br>
There is no evil that he could not do.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc177' href='#sc177' data-uid='dhp177'>SC 177</a>Truly, the selfish do not enter the realm of the gods.<br>
Fools do not praise generosity.<br>
But the wise one, rejoicing in generosity,<br>
Is thereby happy in the next world.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc178' href='#sc178' data-uid='dhp178'>SC 178</a>Over sole sovereignty of the earth,<br>
Or going to a heaven,<br>
Or lordship over all worlds,<br>
The fruit of stream-winner is supreme.<br></p>
