<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc221' href='#sc221' data-uid='dhp221'>SC 221</a>Abandon anger, give up pride,<br>
Overcome every fetter.<br>
For afflictions do not beset one who has nothing,<br>
Who is unattached to mind and body.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc222' href='#sc222' data-uid='dhp222'>SC 222</a>The one who would restrain anger as it arises,<br>
Like a careening chariot,<br>
I proclaim a true charioteer,<br>
While another just holds the reins.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc223' href='#sc223' data-uid='dhp223'>SC 223</a>Conquer anger with conciliation,<br>
Evil with good,<br>
Stinginess with giving,<br>
And a liar with the truth.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc224' href='#sc224' data-uid='dhp224'>SC 224</a>Speak the truth,<br>
Have no anger,<br>
Give when asked, even from little.<br>
By these three, would you enter the presence of the<br>
gods.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc225' href='#sc225' data-uid='dhp225'>SC 225</a>The wise do no harm,<br>
Ever-restrained in body.<br>
Having gone to the Unshakable State,<br>
They grieve no more.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc226' href='#sc226' data-uid='dhp226'>SC 226</a>For those who are always awake,<br>
Learning day and night,<br>
Intent on Nibbāna,<br>
The toxins disappear.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc227' href='#sc227' data-uid='dhp227'>SC 227</a>O Atula, this is not new but very old:<br>
They criticize one who sits silently, they criticize<br>
one who talks much,<br>
And they criticize one who speaks moderately.<br>
No one in the world goes uncriticized.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc228' href='#sc228' data-uid='dhp228'>SC 228</a>There was not, is not, and never will be<br>
A person wholly criticized or wholly praised.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc229' href='#sc229' data-uid='dhp229'>SC 229</a>Who is worthy to reprove the one<br>
Whom the intelligent, having examined day after<br>
day, praise,<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc230' href='#sc230' data-uid='dhp230'>SC 230</a>Whose conduct is faultless,<br>
Who is intelligent, endowed with wisdom and<br>
virtue,<br>
Who is like a coin of fine gold:<br>
Even the gods praise him;<br>
Even by Brahmā he is praised.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc231' href='#sc231' data-uid='dhp231'>SC 231</a>Guard yourself from violence;<br>
In body, be restrained.<br>
Having now renounced this physical misconduct,<br>
Act properly with the body.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc232' href='#sc232' data-uid='dhp232'>SC 232</a>Guard yourself from angry speech;<br>
In speech, be restrained.<br>
Having now renounced this verbal misconduct,<br>
Act properly with speech.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc233' href='#sc233' data-uid='dhp233'>SC 233</a>Guard yourself against an angry mind;<br>
In mind, be restrained.<br>
Having now renounced this mental misconduct,<br>
Act properly with the mind.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc234' href='#sc234' data-uid='dhp234'>SC 234</a>The wise who are restrained in body, restrained in<br>
speech,<br>
And restrained in mind, are indeed thoroughly<br>
restrained.<br></p>
