<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc290' href='#sc290' data-uid='dhp290'>SC 290</a>If by renouncing a small happiness<br>
One could see a great happiness,<br>
Then, let the wise one, seeing the great happiness,<br>
Renounce the small happiness.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc291' href='#sc291' data-uid='dhp291'>SC 291</a>One who, contaminated by anger,<br>
Would seek happiness at the expense of another’s<br>
affliction,<br>
Is hostility’s prisoner.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc292' href='#sc292' data-uid='dhp292'>SC 292</a>The toxins increase for the proud and negligent.<br>
They reject what should be done<br>
And do what should not be done.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc293' href='#sc293' data-uid='dhp293'>SC 293</a>But those who are well-resolved, ever-mindful of<br>
the body,<br>
Who do not practice what should not be done,<br>
But persevere in what should be done;<br>
For those, mindful and knowing, the toxins<br>
dissipate.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc294' href='#sc294' data-uid='dhp294'>SC 294</a>Having slain mother, father,<br>
And two warrior kings;<br>
Having slain the kingdom and its subjects,<br>
The brahmin, undisturbed, proceeds.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc295' href='#sc295' data-uid='dhp295'>SC 295</a>Having slain mother, father,<br>
And two learned kings, with a tiger as fifth,<br>
The brahmin, undisturbed, proceeds.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc296' href='#sc296' data-uid='dhp296'>SC 296</a>The disciples of Gotama,<br>
They awaken well-awake,<br>
As their mindfulness, day and night,<br>
Is ever-directed to the Buddha.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc297' href='#sc297' data-uid='dhp297'>SC 297</a>The disciples of Gotama,<br>
They awaken well-awake,<br>
Their mindfulness, day and night,<br>
Is ever-directed to the Dhamma.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc298' href='#sc298' data-uid='dhp298'>SC 298</a>The disciples of Gotama,<br>
They awaken well-awake.<br>
Their mindfulness, day and night,<br>
Is ever-directed to the Sangha.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc299' href='#sc299' data-uid='dhp299'>SC 299</a>The disciples of Gotama,<br>
They awaken well-awake.<br>
Their mindfulness, day and night,<br>
Is ever-directed to the body.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc300' href='#sc300' data-uid='dhp300'>SC 300</a>The disciples of Gotama,<br>
They awaken well-awake.<br>
Their mind, day and night,<br>
Is ever-devoted to non-violence.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc301' href='#sc301' data-uid='dhp301'>SC 301</a>The disciples of Gotama,<br>
They awaken well-awake.<br>
Their mind, day and night,<br>
Is ever-devoted to meditation.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc302' href='#sc302' data-uid='dhp302'>SC 302</a>Difficult it is to go forth, difficult to delight thus.<br>
Difficult it is to inhabit households, which are<br>
afflictive.<br>
Painful is the company of people so different.<br>
Suffering afflicts a traveler.<br>
So be neither a traveler nor befallen by suffering.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc303' href='#sc303' data-uid='dhp303'>SC 303</a>The one who is faithful, endowed in virtue,<br>
Possessed of fame and wealth—<br>
Wherever he goes, he is honored.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc304' href='#sc304' data-uid='dhp304'>SC 304</a>The good are seen from afar,<br>
Like snowy mountains.<br>
The bad are unseen here,<br>
Like arrows shot into the night.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc305' href='#sc305' data-uid='dhp305'>SC 305</a>Sitting alone, resting alone,<br>
Roaming alone, keenly attentive,<br>
Mastering himself in solitude:<br>
Such a one would delight in the forest.<br></p>
