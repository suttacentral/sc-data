<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' data-uid='dhp1' href='#sc1' data-uid='dhp1'>SC 1</a>All phenomena are preceded by the mind,<br>
Created by the mind,<br>
And have the mind as their master.<br>
If one speaks or acts from a corrupted mind,<br>
Suffering follows as the cart-wheel follows the ox’s<br>
foot.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' data-uid='dhp2' href='#sc2' data-uid='dhp2'>SC 2</a>All phenomena are preceded by the mind,<br>
Created by the mind,<br>
And have the mind as their master.<br>
If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,<br>
Happiness follows as an ever-present shadow.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' data-uid='dhp3' href='#sc3' data-uid='dhp3'>SC 3</a>He insulted me; he struck me;<br>
He defeated me; he robbed me.<br>
For those who dwell on such resentments,<br>
Enmity never ceases.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' data-uid='dhp4' href='#sc4' data-uid='dhp4'>SC 4</a>He insulted me; he struck me;<br>
He defeated me; he robbed me.<br>
For those who do not dwell on such resentments,<br>
Enmity subsides;<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' data-uid='dhp5' href='#sc5' data-uid='dhp5'>SC 5</a>For enmities are never appeased by enmity.<br>
They are appeased by peace.<br>
This is an eternal law.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' data-uid='dhp6' href='#sc6' data-uid='dhp6'>SC 6</a>But many do not realize that we all must die.<br>
Those who do realize this appease their quarrels.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' data-uid='dhp7' href='#sc7' data-uid='dhp7'>SC 7</a>One who lives unrestrained in the senses<br>
And focused on pleasant things,<br>
Who is immoderate in food,<br>
Who is listless and lazy:<br>
Māra overcomes him,<br>
Just as wind overcomes a weak tree.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' data-uid='dhp8' href='#sc8' data-uid='dhp8'>SC 8</a>One who lives restrained in the senses<br>
And focused on unpleasant things,<br>
Who is moderate in food,<br>
Who has faith and diligence:<br>
Māra cannot overcome him,<br>
Just as wind cannot overcome a rocky mountain.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' data-uid='dhp9' href='#sc9' data-uid='dhp9'>SC 9</a>Whoever would take on the yellow robe,<br>
While hampered by defilement,<br>
Being unrestrained and without truth,<br>
Is unworthy of that yellow robe.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' data-uid='dhp10' href='#sc10' data-uid='dhp10'>SC 10</a>Whoever has thrown off defilement,<br>
Is well-established in virtue,<br>
And is possessed with self-control and truth,<br>
Is truly worthy of the yellow robe.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' data-uid='dhp11' href='#sc11' data-uid='dhp11'>SC 11</a>Those who deem the worthless as valuable,<br>
And see the valuable as worthless:<br>
They do not attain the valuable;<br>
They roam in the field of wrong thought.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' data-uid='dhp12' href='#sc12' data-uid='dhp12'>SC 12</a>(But) those who have known the valuable as valuable<br>
And see the worthless as worthless:<br>
They attain the valuable;<br>
They roam in the field of right thought.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' data-uid='dhp13' href='#sc13' data-uid='dhp13'>SC 13</a>Just as rain penetrates a poorly thatched house,<br>
So passion penetrates an uncultivated mind.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' data-uid='dhp14' href='#sc14' data-uid='dhp14'>SC 14</a>Just as rain does not penetrate a well-thatched house,<br>
So passion fails to penetrate a well-cultivated mind.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' data-uid='dhp15' href='#sc15' data-uid='dhp15'>SC 15</a>Here he grieves, following death he grieves;<br>
In both states the evil-doer grieves.<br>
He grieves, he is afflicted,<br>
Having seen his defiled deeds.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' data-uid='dhp16' href='#sc16' data-uid='dhp16'>SC 16</a>Here he rejoices, following death he rejoices;<br>
In both states he who has done good deeds rejoices.<br>
He rejoices, he delights,<br>
Having seen his pure deeds.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' data-uid='dhp17' href='#sc17' data-uid='dhp17'>SC 17</a>Here he is tormented, following death he is<br>
tormented;<br>
In both states the evil-doer is tormented.<br>
He is tormented knowing, “I have done evil.” Reborn to a miserable state, he is tormented all the<br>
more.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' data-uid='dhp18' href='#sc18' data-uid='dhp18'>SC 18</a>Here he rejoices, following death he rejoices;<br>
In both states he who has done good deeds rejoices.<br>
He rejoices knowing, “I have done good deeds.” Reborn to a blissful state, he rejoices all the more.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' data-uid='dhp19' href='#sc19' data-uid='dhp19'>SC 19</a>One who recites much scripture,<br>
But, being negligent, does not act accordingly,<br>
Is like a cowherd counting others’ cows,<br>
Having no share in the fruits of monastic life.<br></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' data-uid='dhp20' href='#sc20' data-uid='dhp20'>SC 20</a>One who recites little scripture,<br>
But lives in truth according to the teaching,<br>
Having abandoned lust, ill will, and delusion,<br>
Having right knowledge and a well-emancipated<br>
mind,<br>
Not clinging in this world or the next:<br>
He truly shares the fruits of monastic life.<br></p>
