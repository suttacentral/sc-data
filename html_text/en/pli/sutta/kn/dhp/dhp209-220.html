<h1>Affection</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp209" id="209"></a>Giving himself to things to be shunned and not exerting where exertion is needed, a seeker after pleasures, having given up his true welfare, envies those intent upon theirs.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp210" id="210"></a>Seek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved, for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved, both are painful.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp211" id="211"></a>Therefore hold nothing dear, for separation from the dear is painful. There are no bonds for those who have nothing beloved or unloved.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp212" id="212"></a>From endearment springs grief, from endearment springs fear. For one who is wholly free from endearment there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp213" id="213"></a>From affection springs grief, from affection springs fear. For one who is wholly free from affection there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp214" id="214"></a>From attachment springs grief, from attachment springs fear. For one who is wholly free from attachment there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp215" id="215"></a>From lust springs grief, from lust springs fear. For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp216" id="216"></a>From craving springs grief, from craving springs fear. For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp217" id="217"></a>People hold dear him who embodies virtue and insight, who is principled, has realized the truth, and who himself does what he ought to be doing.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp218" id="218"></a>One who is intent upon the Ineffable (Nibbana), dwells with mind inspired (by supramundane wisdom), and is no more bound by sense pleasures—such a man is called “One Bound Upstream.”</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp219" id="219"></a>When, after a long absence, a man safely returns from afar, his relatives, friends and well-wishers welcome him home on arrival.</p>
<p><a class="sc" data-uid="dhp220" id="220"></a>As kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival, even so his own good deeds will welcome the doer of good who has gone from this world to the next.</p>
