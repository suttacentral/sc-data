<p>Once while the Blessed One was staying in the vicinity of Sāvatthi, in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery, a certain deity, whose surpassing brilliance and beauty illumined the entire Jeta Grove, late one night came to the presence of the Blessed One; having come to him and offered profound salutations he stood on one side and spoke to him reverently in the following verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Many deities and human beings<br>
Have pondered what are blessings,<br>
Which they hope will bring them safety:<br>
Declare to them, Sir, the Highest Blessing.</p>
<p><span class='add'>To this the Blessed One replied:</span></p>

They are everywhere unvanquished,<br>
And everywhere they go in safety:<br>
Theirs, the Highest Blessings.</p>
