<p>‘Just, O king, as a well-made and balanced bow bends equally from end to end, and does not resist stiffly, like a post; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, bend easily in accord with all his brethren—whether elders, juniors, of medium seniority, or of like standing with himself—and not repel them. This, O king, is the one quality of the bow he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Vidhura Puṇṇaka Jātaka:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Let the wise bend as the bow, yield as the reed,<br>
Not be contrary. He shall dwell in the home of kings.”’</p>
