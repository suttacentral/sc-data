<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs5'></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, that one quality of the scorpion you say he ought to take, which is it?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the scorpion, whose tail is its weapon, keeps its tail erect as it wanders about; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have knowledge as his weapon, <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en329'></a> and dwell with his weapon, knowledge, always drawn. This, O king, is the quality of the scorpion he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Upasena Vaṅganta-putta, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“With his sword of knowledge drawn, the man of insight<br>
Should ever be unconquerable in the fight,<br>
Set free from every fear.”’</p>
