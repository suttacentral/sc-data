<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs1'></a><a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli65'></a>The king said: ‘Are the five Āyatanas, Nāgasena, (eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body,) produced by various actions, or by one action?’ (that is, the result of various Karmas, or of one Karma.)</p>
<p>‘By various actions, not by one.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Now, what do you think, O king? If I were to sow in one field five kinds of seed, would the produce of those various seeds be of different kinds?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, certainly.’</p>
<p>‘Well, just so with respect to the production of āyatanas.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
