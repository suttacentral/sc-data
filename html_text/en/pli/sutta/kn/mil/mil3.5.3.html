<h1>3.5.3. Knowing the Buddha’s incomparability</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs3'></a>The king said: ‘Is it possible, Nāgasena, for others to know how incomparable the Buddha is?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, they may know it.’</p>
<p>‘But how can they?’</p>
<p>‘Long, long ago, O king, there was a master of writing, by name Tissa the Elder, and many are the years gone by since he has died. How can people know of him?’</p>
<p>‘By his writing, Sir.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, whosoever sees what the Truth is, he sees what the Blessed One was, for the Truth was preached by the Blessed One.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
