<p>‘Just as the squirrel, O king, when an enemy falls upon him, beats his tail on the ground till it swells, and then with his own tail as a cudgel drives off the foe; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when his enemy, sin, falls upon him, beat the cudgel of his self-possession till it swells, and then by the cudgel of self-possession drive all evil inclinations off. This, O king, is the one quality of the squirrel which he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by culla Panthaka, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“When sins, those fell destroyers of the gains<br>
Gained by the life of recluse, fall on us,<br>
They should be slain, again and yet again,<br>
By resolute self-possession as a club.”’</p>
