<h1>3.1.7. Wisdom and reasoning distinguished</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs7'></a>The king said: ‘Nāgasena, he who escapes reindividualisation is it by reasoning that he escapes it?’</p>
<p>‘Both by reasoning, your Majesty, and by wisdom, and by other good qualities.’</p>
<p>‘But are not reasoning and wisdom surely much the same?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not. Reasoning is one thing, wisdom <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en51'></a> another. Sheep and goats, oxen and buffaloes, camels and asses have reasoning, but wisdom they have not.’</p>
<p>‘Well put, Nāgasena!’</p>
