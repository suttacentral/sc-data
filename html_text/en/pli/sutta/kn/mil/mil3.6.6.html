<h1>3.6.6. Tears</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs6'></a>The king said: ‘To which of these two, Nāgasena—the man who weeps at the death of his mother, and the man who weeps out of love for the Truth (Dhamma)—are his tears a cure?’</p>
<p>‘The tears of the one, O king, are stained and hot with the three fires of passion. The tears of the other are stainless and cool. Now there is cure in coolness and calm, but in heat and passion there can be no cure.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
