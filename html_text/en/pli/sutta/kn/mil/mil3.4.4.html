<h1>3.4.4. Rich and poor</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs2'></a>The king said: ‘Why is it, Nāgasena, that all men are not alike, but some are short-lived and some long-lived, some sickly and some healthy, some ugly and some beautiful, some without influence and some of great power, some poor and some wealthy, some low born and some high born, some stupid and somewise?’ <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en101'></a>The Elder replied: ‘Why is it that all vegetables are not alike, but some sour, and some salt, and some pungent, and some acid, and some astringent, and some sweet?’</p>
<p>‘I fancy, Sir, it is because they come from different kinds of seeds.’</p>
<p>‘And just so, great king, are the differences you have mentioned among men to be explained. For it has been said by the Blessed One: “Beings, O brahmin, have each their own Karma, are inheritors of Karma, belong to the tribe of their Karma, are relatives by Karma, have each their Karma as their protecting overlord. It is Karma that divides them up into low and high and the like divisions.”’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
