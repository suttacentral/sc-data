<h1>3.7.4. How far to heaven?</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs4'></a>The king said: ‘How far is it, Nāgasena, from here to the Brahma world ?’</p>
<p>‘Very far is it, O king. If a rock, the size of an upper chamber, were to fall from there, it would take four months to reach the earth, though it came down eight-and-forty thousand leagues each day and night.’</p>
<p>‘Good, Nāgasena! Now do not your people say that a Bhikkhu, who has the power of Iddhi and the mastery over his mind, can vanish from jambu-dīpa, and appear in the Brahma world, as quickly as a strong man could stretch forth his bent up arm, or bend it in again if it were stretched out? That is a saying I cannot believe. How is it possible that he could traverse so quickly so many hundreds of leagues?’</p>
<p>The Elder replied: ‘In what district, O king, were you born?’ <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en127'></a></p>
<p>‘There is an island called Alasanda. It was there I was born.’</p>
<p>‘And how far is Alasanda from here?’</p>
<p>‘About two hundred leagues.’</p>
<p>‘Do you know for certain of any business you once did there and now recollect?’</p>
<p>‘Oh, yes.’</p>
<p>‘So quickly, great king, have you gone about two hundred leagues.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
