<h1>3.3.4. Conditions</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs4'></a>The king said: ‘Are there any conditions which are produced?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly.’</p>
<p>‘Which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Where there is an eye, and also forms, there is sight, where there is sight there is a contact through the eye, where there is contact through the eye there is a sensation, where there is sensation there is a longing, where there is longing there is a grasping, where there is grasping there is a becoming, <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en83'></a> where there is becoming there is birth, and at birth old age and death, grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair begin to be. Thus is the rise of the whole of this class of pain.—Where there is neither eye nor form there is no sight, where there is not sight there is no contact through the eye, where there is not contact there is no sensation, where there is not sensation there is no longing, where there is not longing there is no grasping, where there is not grasping there is no becoming, where there is not becoming there is no birth, and where there is not birth there is neither old age nor death nor grief, lamentation, pain, sorrow, and despair. Thus is the ending of all this class of pain.</p>
