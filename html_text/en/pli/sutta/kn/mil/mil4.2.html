<h1>4.2. Kinds of people who spoil discussions</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs5'></a>‘There are eight kinds of people, Nāgasena, who when talking a matter over, spoil the discussion. And who are the eight? He who walks in lust, he who walks in ill-will, he who walks in delusion, he who walks in pride, the greedy man, the sluggard, the man of one idea, and the fool.’</p>
<p>‘What is the objection to each of these?’ asked the Elder.</p>
<p>‘The first spoils the discussion by his lust, the next by his ill-will, the third by his delusions, the fourth by his pride, the fifth by his greed, the sixth by his sloth, the seventh by his narrowness, and the last by his folly. Therefore is it said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The lustful, angry, or bewildered man,<br>
The proud, the greedy, or the slothful man,<br>
The man of one idea, and the poor fool—<br>
These eight are spoilers of high argument.”’</p>
