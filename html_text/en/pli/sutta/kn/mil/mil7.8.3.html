<h1>7.8.3. The Sunshade</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs4'></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those three qualities of the sunshade you say he ought to take, which are they?’ <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en366'></a></p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the sunshade goes along over one’s head; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be of a character above all evil dispositions. This, O king, is the first quality of the sunshade he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs5'></a>‘And again, O king, just as the sunshade is held over the head by a handle; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, have thoughtfulness as his handle. This, O king, is the second quality of the sunshade he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs6'></a>‘And again, O king, as the sunshade wards off winds and heat and storms of rain; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, ward off the empty winds of the opinions of the numerous Samanas and Brahmans who hold forth their various and divergent nostrums, ward off the heat of the threefold fire (of lust, malice, and dullness), and ward off the rains of evil dispositions. <a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli416'></a> This, O king, is the third quality of the sunshade he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“As a broad sunshade spreading far and firm,<br>
Without a hole from rim to rim, wards off<br>
The burning heat, and the god’s mighty rain;<br>
So doth the Buddha’s son, all pure within,<br>
Bearing the sunshade brave of righteousness,<br>
Ward off the rain of evil tendencies,<br>
And the dread heat of all the threefold fire.”’</p>
