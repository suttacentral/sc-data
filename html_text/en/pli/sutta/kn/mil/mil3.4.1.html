<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs1'></a><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs15'></a>The king said: ‘When those conditions (whose marks you have just specified) have run together, is it possible, by bending them apart one to one side and one to the other, to make the distinction between them clear, so that one can say:, “This is contact, and this sensation, and this idea, and this intention, and this perception, and this reflection, and this investigation”?’</p>
<p>‘No: that cannot be done.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Suppose, O king, the cook in the royal household were to make a syrup or a sauce, and were to put into it curds, and salt, and ginger, and cummin seed, and pepper, and other ingredients. And suppose the king were to say to him: “Pick out for me the flavour of the curds, and of the salt, and of the ginger, and of the cummin seed, and of the pepper, and of all the things you have put into it.” Now would it be possible, great king, separating off one from another those flavours that had thus run together, to pick out each one, so that one could say: “Here is the sourness, and here the saltness, and here the pungency, and here the acidity, and here the astringency, and here the sweetness”?’ <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en98'></a></p>
<p>‘No, that would not be possible <a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli64'></a>. But each flavour would nevertheless be distinctly present by its characteristic sign.’</p>
<p>‘And just so, great king, with respect to those conditions we were discussing.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
