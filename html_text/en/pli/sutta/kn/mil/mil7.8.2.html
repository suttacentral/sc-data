<h1>7.8.2. Black Iron</h1>

<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs2'></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of black iron you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p><a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli415'></a> ‘Just, O king, as black iron even when <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en365'></a> beaten out carries weight; just so, O king, should the mind of the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be able, by his habit of thoughtfulness, to carry heavy burdens.

<p>“That man who is in insight purified,<br>
Trained in the doctrine of the Noble Ones,<br>
Grasping distinctions as they really are,<br>
What need hath he to tremble? Not in part<br>
Only, but in its full extent, shall he<br>
To the clear heights of Arahatship attain.”’</p>
