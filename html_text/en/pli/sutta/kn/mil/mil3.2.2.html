<h1>3.2.2. Rebirth and awareness</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs2'></a>The king said: ‘Is a man, Nāgasena, who will not be reborn, aware of the fact?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, O king.’</p>
<p>‘And how does he know it</p>
<p>‘By the cessation of all that is cause, proximate or remote, of rebirth.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Suppose a farmer, great king, had ploughed and sown and filled his granary; and then for a period should neither plough nor sow, but live on the <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en66'></a> stored-up grain, or dispose of it in barter, or deal with it as he had need. Would the farmer be aware, great king, that his granary was not getting filled?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, he ought to know it.’</p>
<p>‘But how?’</p>
<p>‘He would know that the cause, proximate and remote, of the filling of the granary had ceased.’</p>
<p>‘Just so with the man you spoke of. By the cessation of all that leads to rebirth, he would be conscious of having escaped his liability to it.’</p>
<p>‘Well explained, Nāgasena!’</p>
