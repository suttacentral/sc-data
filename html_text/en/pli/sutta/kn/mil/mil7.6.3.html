<h1>7.6.3. The PeṇāHikā Bird</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs11'></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the Peṇāhikā bird you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the Peṇāhikā bird, through jealousy of her mate, refuses to nourish her young ; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be jealous of any evil dispositions <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en343'></a> which arise within him, and putting them by his mindfulness into the excellent crevice of self-control, should dwell at the door of his mind in the constant practice of self-possession in all things relating to his body. This, O king, is the first quality of the Peṇāhikā bird he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs12'></a>‘And again, O king, as the Peṇāhikā bird spends the day in the forest in search of food, but at night time resorts for protection to the flock of birds to which she belongs; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, who has for a time resorted to solitary places for the purpose of emancipation from the ten Fetters, and found no satisfaction therein, repair back to the Order for protection against the danger of blame, and dwell under the shelter of the Order. This, O king, is the second quality of the Peṇāhikā bird he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Brahmā Sahampati in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Seek lodgings distant from the haunts of men,<br>
Live there in freedom from the bonds of sin;<br>
But he who finds no peace in solitude<br>
May with the Order dwell, guarded in heart,<br>
Mindful and self-possessed.”’</p>
