<h1>6.2.7. Dilemma the Sixty-Seventh. Dead Demons</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs19'></a>‘Venerable Nāgasena, are there such things as demons (Yakkhā) in the world?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, O king.’</p>
<p>‘Do they ever leave that condition’ (fall out of that phase of existence)?</p>
<p>‘Yes, they do.’</p>
<p>‘But, if so, why is it that the remains of those dead Yakkhas are never found, nor any odour of their corpses smelt? ’</p>
<p>‘<a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli272'></a>Their remains are found, O king, and an odour does arise from their dead bodies. The remains of bad Yakkhas can be seen in the form of <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en109'></a> worms and beetles and ants and moths and snakes and scorpions and centipedes, and birds and wild beasts.’</p>
<p>‘Who else, O Nāgasena, could have solved this puzzle except one as wise as you!’</p>
<p class='endsection'>Here ends the dilemma as to dead demons.</p>
