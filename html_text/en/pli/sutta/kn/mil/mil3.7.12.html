<h1>3.7.12. Ocean</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs12'></a>The king said: ‘There is the expression ocean, Nāgasena. Why is the water called ocean?’</p>
<p>The Elder replied <a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli86'></a>: ‘Because there is just as much salt as water, O king, and just as much water as salt, therefore is it called ocean.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
