<h1>3.4.10. One not receiving Nibbāna knows it is happy</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs8'></a>The king said: ‘Venerable Nāgasena, does he who does not receive Nirvāṇa know how happy a state Nirvāṇa is ?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, he knows it.’</p>
<p>‘But how can he know that without his receiving Nirvāṇa?’</p>
<p>‘Now what do you think, O king? Do those whose hands and feet have not been cut off know how sad a thing it is to have them cut off?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, Sir, that they know.’</p>
<p>‘But how do they know it?’</p>
<p>‘Well, by hearing the sound of the lamentation of those whose hands and feet have been cut off, they know it.’</p>
<p><a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli70'></a> ‘Just so, great king, it is by hearing the glad words of those who have seen Nirvāṇa, that they who have not received it know how happy a state it is.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
