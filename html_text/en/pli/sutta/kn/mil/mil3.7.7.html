<h1>3.7.7. Is merit or demerit greater?</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='pts-cs' id='pts-cs7'></a>The king said: ‘Which, Nāgasena, is there more of, merit or demerit?’</p>
<p>‘Merit.’ <a class='pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli84'></a></p>
<p>‘But why?’</p>
<p>‘He who does wrong, O king, comes to feel remorse, and acknowledges his evil-doing. So demerit does not increase. But he who does well feels no remorse, and feeling no remorse gladness will <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en129'></a> spring up within him, and joy will arise to him thus gladdened, and so rejoicing all his frame will be at peace, and being thus at peace he will experience a blissful feeling of content, and in that bliss his heart will be at rest, and he whose heart is thus at rest knows things as they really are. For that reason merit increases. A man, for example, though his hands and feet are cut off, if he gave to the Blessed One merely a handful of lotuses, would not enter purgatory for ninety-one Kalpas. That is why I said, O king, that there is more merit than demerit.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
