<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw952'>Walt 952</a> At one time the Leader of Men<br>

in the city, Rajagaha,<br>
<span class='add'>which was</span> lovely and prosperous.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw953'>Walt 953</a> This is what was reasoned out <span class='add'>then</span><br>
by the nun <span class='add'>named</span> Yasodharā,<br>
who was dwelling in that city,<br>
inside a lovely convent <span class='add'>there</span>:</p>

they've gone to peaceful <span class='add'>nirvana</span>,<br>
traceless like the flame of a lamp.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw956'>Walt 956</a> While the World's Lord still is living,<br>
I’ll travel that peaceful path too.”<br>
And having reasoned <span class='add'>all</span> that out,<br>
she foresaw the end of her life.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw957'>Walt 957</a> Foreseeing that life’s aggregates<br>

she set out from her own ashram,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw960'>Walt 960</a> “I'm seventy-eight years old now,<br>
the last of old age has arrived;<br>

death breaks <span class='add'>the body into bits</span>;<br>
today at nighttime, Great Hero,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw963'>Walt 963</a> Where there's no birth, no growing old,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw966'>Walt 966</a> After hearing <span class='add'>that</span> speech of hers,<br>
the Lord of Sages <span class='add'>then</span> said this:<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw970'>Walt 970</a> In your household, O Hero, I<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw971'>Walt 971</a> All of those women, endowed with<br>
the virtues of beauty and grace,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw974'>Walt 974</a> Speaking <span class='add'>words</span> beginning with these,<br>
having risen into the sky,<br>
Yasodharā displayed diverse<br>
powers, with Buddha’s permission.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw975'>Walt 975</a> Worshipping the Sambuddha, she<br>
showed the Teacher superpowers.<br>
She displayed great superpowers,<br>
diverse, having various forms. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p>Body big as the universe,<br>
she <span class='add'>made</span> the continent up north<br>

<span class='add'>her</span> eyes were the moon and the sun,<br>
<span class='add'>her</span> crest was cosmic Mount Meru. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw977'>Walt 977</a> <span class='add'>In her</span> beak, mountain at world’s end,<br>

she’s worshipping the World’s Leader. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw978'>Walt 978</a> She made herself an elephant,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw979'>Walt 979</a> She covered the thousand-fold world<br>
with blooming lotus, <span class='add'>and then said,</span><br>
“I am Yasodharā, Hero;<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw980'>Walt 980</a> And making Brahma’s form appear,<br>
she preached the doctrine of merit;<br>
"I am Yasodharā, Hero;<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw999'>Walt 999</a> I performed a lot of service,<br>

four incalculable <span class='add'>aeons</span><br>
hence, Dīpaṅkara, Great Hero,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1002'>Walt 1002</a> At that time there was a brahmin<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1006'>Walt 1006</a> At that time I saw <span class='add'>that</span> sage’s<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1007'>Walt 1007</a> Making <span class='add'>my</span> heart even more pleased,<br>
