<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1185'>Walt 1185</a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was a Master of Everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader arose in the world<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1186'>Walt 1186</a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
in a clan of ministers then,<br>
rich, prosperous, very wealthy,<br>
glistening with various gems. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1187'>Walt 1187</a> Going along with <span class='add'>my</span> father,<br>
surrounded by a multitude,<br>
having heard the Buddha’s Teaching,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1188'>Walt 1188</a> After going forth I gave up<br>
evil karma with the body.<br>
I purified my way of life,<br>
except for poor conduct through speech. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1189'>Walt 1189</a> Pleased in the Buddha, Teaching and<br>
Assembly; eager, respectful,<br>
used to hearing the great Teaching;<br>
I’m greedy to see the Buddha. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1190'>Walt 1190</a> I then heard <span class='add'>of</span> a Buddhist nun,<br>
foremost among those freed by faith.<br>
Aspiring to <span class='add'>attain</span> that place,<br>
I then fulfilled the three trainings.<br>
The Rest for Those Seeking Pity,<br>
the Well-Gone-One, thereupon said <span class='add'>this</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6,.7a-b'>Verse 6,.7a-b</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1191'>Walt 1191</a> “He whose faith in the Thus-Gone-One<br>
is well-established, not shaking,<br>
and whose morals are beautiful,<br>
dear to noble people, and praised; <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7c-d,.8a-b'>Verse 7c-d,.8a-b</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1192'>Walt 1192</a> whose insight is upright and whose<br>
pleasure is in the Assembly:<br>
it is said, “he is not wretched;”<br>
his life’s <span class='add'>considered</span> not useless. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8c-d,.9a-b'>Verse 8c-d,.9a-b</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1193'>Walt 1193</a> Therefore, wise ones, commit <span class='add'>yourselves</span><br>
to faith and to morality,<br>
to <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-insight and pleasure;<br>
pith of Buddha’s dispensation.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9c-d,.10a-b'>Verse 9c-d,.10a-b</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1194'>Walt 1194</a> Hearing that, being overjoyed,<br>
I questioned <span class='add'>him about</span> my wish.<br>
Then the Supreme, Measureless One,<br>
the Guide, prophesied <span class='add'>in this way:</span> <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10c-d,.11a-b'>Verse 10c-d,.11a-b</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1195'>Walt 1195</a> “Lovely one, pleased in the Buddha,<br>
you will receive that well-wished <span class='add'>place</span>.<br>
In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11c-d,.12'>Verse 11c-d,.12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1196'>Walt 1196</a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
she named Sigālaka’s Mother<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1197'>Walt 1197</a> Gladdened after having heard that,<br>
with a heart that was <span class='add'>full</span> of love,<br>
as long as life I then served the<br>
Victor, Guide, through <span class='add'>my</span> practices. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1198'>Walt 1198</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1199'>Walt 1199</a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
in Giribbaja, best city,<br>
<span class='add'>I was</span> born to rich millionaires,<br>
with a huge quantity of gems. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1200'>Walt 1200</a> My son was named Sigālaka,<br>
taking delight on the wrong road,<br>
slipped into the jungle of views,<br>
keen to worship the directions. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1201'>Walt 1201</a> Standing on the road, the Buddha,<br>
the Guide, advised him, seeing him<br>
coming toward the city praising<br>
the directions with balls of food. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1202'>Walt 1202</a> When he was preaching the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
there were amazing shrieks of joy;<br>
twenty million men <span class='add'>and</span> women<br>
gained insight into the Teaching. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1203'>Walt 1203</a> Then having gone <span class='add'>into</span> the crowd,<br>
having heard the Well-Gone-One’s speech,<br>
gaining the fruit of stream-entry,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1204'>Walt 1204</a> After not a very long time,<br>
hankering to see the Buddha,<br>
refining mindfulness <span class='add'>through</span> him,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1205'>Walt 1205</a> I’m going every single day<br>
in order to see the Buddha.<br>
I’m dissatisfied looking at<br>
only <span class='add'>his</span> eye-pleasing body, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1206'>Walt 1206</a> produced by all the perfections,<br>
excellent lair of good fortune,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> body, strewn with all goodness:<br>
dissatisfied, I’m living <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1207'>Walt 1207</a> The Victor, pleased at that virtue,<br>
placed me in that foremost <span class='add'>place:</span><br>
“The Mother of Sigālaka’s<br>
foremost among those freed by faith.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1208'>Walt 1208</a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1209'>Walt 1209</a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1210'>Walt 1210</a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1211'>Walt 1211</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28'>Verse 28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1212'>Walt 1212</a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1213'>Walt 1213</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30'>Verse 30</a></p>
