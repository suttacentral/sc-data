<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw416'>Walt 416</a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
the One with Eyes for everything,<br>
the Leader <span class='add'>of the World,</span> arose<br>
a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw417'>Walt 417</a> I was born in Haṃsavatī,<br>
in a clan of millionaires then,<br>
glistening with various gems,<br>
endowed with supreme happiness. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw418'>Walt 418</a> Having approached that Great Hero,<br>
I heard <span class='add'>him</span> preaching <span class='add'>his</span> <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.<br>
Afterward, becoming pleased, I<br>
approached the Victor for refuge. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw419'>Walt 419</a> Having begged mother and father,<br>
after inviting <span class='add'>him,</span> the Guide,<br>
I fed <span class='add'>the Buddha</span> for a week,<br>
together with his followers. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw420'>Walt 420</a> At the end of <span class='add'>those</span> seven days,<br>
the Charioteer of Men placed<br>
a great nun in the foremost place<br>
among those who have great wisdom. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw421'>Walt 421</a> Hearing that, being overjoyed,<br>
doing further good works for <span class='add'>him,</span><br>
the Great Sage, after bowing down,<br>
I aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw422'>Walt 422</a> Then the Victor said this to me:<br>
“Let your aspiration succeed!<br>
Deeds done for me with Assembly<br>
<span class='add'>will bear</span> measureless fruit for you. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw423'>Walt 423</a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw424'>Walt 424</a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>

you’ll be she whose name is Khemā,<br>
<span class='add'>and will</span> attain that foremost place.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw425'>Walt 425</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw426'>Walt 426</a> Fallen thence, I went to Yāma,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then I went to Tusita,<br>
and then to Nimmānarati,<br>
and then Vāsavatti City. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw427'>Walt 427</a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
in accordance with that karma,<br>
everyplace I was made chief queen<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw428'>Walt 428</a> Fallen thence, in the human state,<br>
<span class='add'>everyplace</span> I was made chief queen<br>
of kings who turn the wheel <span class='add'>of law,</span><br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw429'>Walt 429</a> Having experienced success,<br>
among gods as well as humans,<br>
becoming happy everywhere,<br>
I transmigrated for aeons. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw430'>Walt 430</a> <span class='add'>Then</span> ninety-one aeons ago,<br>
the World-Leader <span class='add'>named</span> Vipassi<br>
arose, the One with Lovely Eyes,<br>
with Insight into Everything. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw431'>Walt 431</a> I went up to that World-Leader,<br>
the Charioteer Among Men.<br>
Hearing <span class='add'>his</span> exalted Teaching,<br>
I went forth into homelessness. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw432'>Walt 432</a> After living the holy life<br>
<span class='add'>during fully</span> ten thousand years,<br>
in that Wise One’s dispensation,<br>
bent on effort, very learned, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw433'>Walt 433</a> skillful in the heaps of causes,<br>

clever, varied speaker, <span class='add'>I was</span><br>
one who’s done what the Teacher taught. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw434'>Walt 434</a> Fallen thence I was reborn in<br>
Tusita, with fame and splendor.<br>
I surpassed the other <span class='add'>gods</span> there,<br>
as the fruit of the holy life. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw435'>Walt 435</a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
I’m very rich and prosperous,<br>
intelligent and beautiful,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> my retinue is well-trained. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw436'>Walt 436</a> Due to <span class='add'>my</span> karma, through effort<br>
in the Victor’s dispensation,<br>
I enjoy every attainment,<br>
obtained with ease, pleasing the mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw437'>Walt 437</a> Through the fruit of my good conduct,<br>
nobody treats me with contempt,<br>
even he who was my husband<br>
in whichever place I’m reborn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw438'>Walt 438</a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
whose name was Koṇāgamana,<br>
Best Debater, <span class='add'>Buddha,</span> arose. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw439'>Walt 439</a> <span class='add'>We were</span> born in a very rich<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw440'>Walt 440</a> <span class='add'>We</span> lay-donors gave a thousand<br>

that place to Him with Assembly. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw441'>Walt 441</a> Fallen thence, all we <span class='add'>three women</span><br>
were reborn in Tāvatiṃsa<br>
<span class='add'>where</span> we attained the foremost fame,<br>
and just the same among people. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw442'>Walt 442</a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon,<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw443'>Walt 443</a> The attendant of the Great Sage<br>
was the ruler of men back then,<br>
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,<br>
in Benares, greatest city. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28'>Verse 28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw444'>Walt 444</a> I was that <span class='add'>king’s</span> eldest daughter,<br>
well-known <span class='add'>by the name</span> “Samaṇī.”<br>
Hearing the Best Victor’s Teaching,<br>
I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw445-446'>Walt 445-446</a> Our father did not permit it;<br>
we <span class='add'>stayed</span> at home during that time,<br>
comfortable royal maidens<br>
doing <span class='add'>our</span> practice with vigor<br>
in virginal celibacy,<br>
for twenty times a thousand years,<br>
fond of waiting on the Buddha,<br>
<span class='add'>the king’s</span> seven joyful daughters. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30-31'>Verse 30-31</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw447'>Walt 447</a> Samaṇī, and Samaṇaguttā,<br>
Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā,<br>
Dhammā, and also Sudhammā,<br>
and seventh Saṅghadāyikā, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw32'>Verse 32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw448'>Walt 448</a> <span class='add'>now</span> I, and Uppalavaṇṇā,<br>
Paṭācārā and Kuṇḍalā,<br>
Kisāgotamī, Dhammadinnā,<br>
and Visākhā is the seventh. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33'>Verse 33</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw449'>Walt 449</a>Once when the Sun Among People<br>
was preaching the marvelous Truth,<br>
having heard it, I memorized<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Mahānidānasuttanta</i>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw34'>Verse 34</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw450'>Walt 450</a> Due to those karmas done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw35'>Verse 35</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw451'>Walt 451</a> And now, in <span class='add'>my</span> final rebirth,<br>
in Sāgalā, best of cities,<br>
I am the Madda king’s daughter,<br>
well-liked, held dear <span class='add'>and</span> beloved. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw36'>Verse 36</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw452'>Walt 452</a> <span class='add'>All</span> was peaceful in that city<br>
when I was coming into birth.<br>
After that, due to that virtue,<br>
they gave the name “Khemā” to me. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw37'>Verse 37</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw453'>Walt 453</a> When I attained the prime of youth,<br>
I was adorned with beauty and grace.<br>
At that time my father gave me<br>
to <span class='add'>the great</span> king, Bimbisāra. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw38'>Verse 38</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw454'>Walt 454</a> I was his best-beloved <span class='add'>queen,</span><br>
taking great pride in <span class='add'>my</span> beauty.<br>
<span class='add'>Thinking,</span> “He speaks ill of beauty,”<br>
I dodged the Compassionate One. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw39'>Verse 39</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw455'>Walt 455</a> At that time, King Bimbisāra,<br>
with knowledge and great love for me,<br>
after praising the Bamboo Grove,<br>
brought singers <span class='add'>to praise it</span> for me: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw40'>Verse 40</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw456'>Walt 456</a> “We think that one who has not seen<br>
the Bamboo Grove, so delightful,<br>
nor the lair of the Well-Gone-One,<br>
has not seen <span class='add'>the garden named</span> ‘Joy.’ <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw41'>Verse 41</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw457'>Walt 457</a> <span class='add'>But</span> one who’s seen the Bamboo Grove,<br>
the ‘Joy’ that’s enjoyed by people,<br>
that one’s seen <span class='add'>the garden named</span> ‘Joy,’<br>
much enjoyed by the king of gods. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw42'>Verse 42</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw458'>Walt 458</a> Giving up <span class='add'>the garden named</span> ‘Joy,’<br>
descending to the earth’s surface,<br>
gods are satisfied, astonished,<br>
seeing the lovely Bamboo Grove. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw43'>Verse 43</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw459'>Walt 459</a> What speaker can fully exclaim<br>
its accumulated virtue,<br>
produced by the merit of kings,<br>
beautified by Buddha’s merit?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw44'>Verse 44</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw460'>Walt 460</a> Hearing of its magnificence<br>
which was delightful to my ears,<br>
desiring to see that garden,<br>
I then announced <span class='add'>this</span> to the king. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw45'>Verse 45</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw461'>Walt 461</a> Then <span class='add'>the king,</span> the lord of the earth,<br>
along with a large retinue,<br>
led me <span class='add'>by procession</span> to that<br>
garden I was longing to see. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw46'>Verse 46</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw462'>Walt 462</a> “Go <span class='add'>and</span> look at the great riches<br>
<span class='add'>of</span> that grove, pleasing to the eyes;<br>
it always glows with radiance,<br>
colored by the Buddha’s aura.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw47'>Verse 47</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw463'>Walt 463</a> And when the Sage, <span class='add'>out begging</span> alms,<br>
had entered Rajgir, best city,<br>
at that very time I went out,<br>
<span class='add'>desiring</span> to look at that grove. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw48'>Verse 48</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw464'>Walt 464</a> Then <span class='add'>I entered</span> that grove in bloom,<br>
<span class='add'>alive</span> with varied bees buzzing,<br>
full of Indian cuckoo songs,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> dances by a peacock-troupe, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw49'>Verse 49</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw465'>Walt 465</a> free of <span class='add'>excess</span> noise, uncluttered,<br>
embellished with varied walkways,<br>
with scattered huts and pavilions,<br>
resplendent with diverse yogis. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw50'>Verse 50</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw466'>Walt 466</a> Wandering about <span class='add'>there,</span> I thought,<br>
“my eyes are now proving their worth.”<br>
Having seen in that very place<br>
a youthful monk, I thought of him: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw51'>Verse 51</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw467'>Walt 467</a> “Staying in a delightful grove<br>
like this, in early youth as though<br>
it is the springtime, well-endowed<br>
with a body which is pleasing, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw52'>Verse 52</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw468'>Walt 468</a> bald-headed, wrapped in saffron robes,<br>
seated at the foot of a tree<br>
he meditates, a Buddhist monk,<br>
discarding sensual delight. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw53'>Verse 53</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw469'>Walt 469</a> Shouldn’t this auspicious Teaching<br>
be practiced by old folks, after<br>
<span class='add'>they have lived</span> the domestic life,<br>
enjoying pleasure as they like?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw54'>Verse 54</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw470'>Walt 470</a> Discerning that it was empty,<br>
I approached the perfumed house, the<br>
Victor’s home, <span class='add'>but</span> spied the Victor,<br>
like the sun when it is rising, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw55'>Verse 55</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw471'>Walt 471</a> sitting happily by himself,<br>
being fanned by a fine woman.<br>
Seeing <span class='add'>that scene,</span> I thought like this:<br>
“isn’t this Bull of Men wretched? <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw56'>Verse 56</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw472'>Walt 472</a> The woman <span class='add'>though</span>, shining like gold,<br>
eyes and face like pink lotuses,<br>
with red lips, looking like jasmine,<br>
pleasing to the mind and the eyes, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw57'>Verse 57</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw473'>Walt 473</a> with ears that are like golden swings,<br>
firm breasts that look like water-jugs,<br>
thin-waisted, a shapely behind,<br>
fine thighs with charming ornaments, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw58'>Verse 58</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw474'>Walt 474</a> dressed in clothing of fine blue silk,<br>
furnished with a border of red,<br>
with unsatisfiable looks,<br>
she has a smiling demeanor.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw59'>Verse 59</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw475'>Walt 475</a> After seeing her, I thought this:<br>
“Wow! This is a super-beauty!<br>
Not ever in the past was seen<br>
by my own eye <span class='add'>such a beauty</span>!” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw60'>Verse 60</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw476'>Walt 476</a> Then she was ravished by old age,<br>
discolored, <span class='add'>her</span> face disfigured.<br>
Her teeth fell out, her hair turned white,<br>
her mouth was fouled with saliva, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw61'>Verse 61</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw477'>Walt 477</a> ears shriveled up, eyes formed cataracts,<br>
breasts sagged <span class='add'>and became</span> repulsive;<br>
wrinkles spread on all of <span class='add'>her</span> parts,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> veins popped out <span class='add'>on that</span> body, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw62'>Verse 62</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw478'>Walt 478</a> crooked-limbed, leaning on a cane,<br>
jutting-ribbed, emaciated,<br>
trembling, fallen <span class='add'>onto</span> the ground,<br>
gasping for every breath she took. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw63'>Verse 63</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw479'>Walt 479</a> And then I was profoundly moved.<br>
Marveled, <span class='add'>my</span> hair standing on end,<br>
<span class='add'>I said,</span> “Woe on filthy beauty!<br>
It is where <span class='add'>only</span> fools delight!” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw64'>Verse 64</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw480'>Walt 480</a> Then the Great Compassionate One,<br>
discerning that <span class='add'>my</span> mind was moved,<br>
happy, with a heart that was thrilled,<br>
he spoke <span class='add'>to me in</span> these verses: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw65'>Verse 65</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw481'>Walt 481</a> “Khemā, see this complex heap as<br>
diseased, disgusting <span class='add'>and</span> putrid.<br>
It is oozing and it’s dripping,<br>
the delight of foolish people. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw66'>Verse 66</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw482'>Walt 482</a> With one-pointed focus, steadfast,<br>
fix your mind on impurity.<br>
Remain mindful of the body;<br>
be intent on disenchantment. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw67'>Verse 67</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw483'>Walt 483</a> Just as is this, so too is that;<br>
just as is that, so too is this:<br>
on the inside and the outside,<br>
be detached from body-delight. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw68'>Verse 68</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw484'>Walt 484</a> Cultivate emancipation<br>
and abandon latent conceit.<br>
Then, through understanding conceit,<br>
you’ll wander in tranquility. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw69'>Verse 69</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw485'>Walt 485</a> Those following the stream, excited with lust,<br>
<span class='add'>are</span> making webs for themselves, like a spider;<br>
<span class='add'>others,</span> cutting that away, are going forth,<br>
indifferent, giving up the pleasures of lust.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw70-71'>Verse 70-71</a></p>
.
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw486'>Walt 486</a>Then the Charioteer of Men,<br>
knowing my mental readiness,<br>
in order to instruct me preached<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Mahānidānasuttanta</i>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw72'>Verse 72</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw487'>Walt 487</a> Hearing that best <i lang='pli' translate='no'>suttanta</i>, I<br>
recalled <span class='add'>my</span> former memory.<br>
Just standing there I was at peace;<br>
I purified my “<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> eye”. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw73'>Verse 73</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw488'>Walt 488</a> Immediately falling down<br>
before the feet of the Great Sage,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>at that moment,</span><br>
to confess offenses <span class='add'>to him</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw74'>Verse 74</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw489'>Walt 489</a> “Praise to you, O Seer of All!<br>
Praise to you, Home of Compassion!<br>
Praise to you, Existence-Crosser!<br>
Praise to you, Path to Deathlessness! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw75'>Verse 75</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw490'>Walt 490</a> Plunged into the thicket of views,<br>
I was doped by passionate lust.<br>
<span class='add'>I now</span> delight in discipline,<br>
disciplined by your righteous trick. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw76'>Verse 76</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw491'>Walt 491</a> Without enjoyment because they<br>
do not see Great Sages like you,<br>
beings in the sea of being,<br>
are undergoing much dis-ease. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw77'>Verse 77</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw492'>Walt 492</a> Though close I did not <span class='add'>go to</span> see<br>
the World’s-Help, Non-Hostility,<br>
the One who Made an End to Death;<br>
I am confessing that offense. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw78'>Verse 78</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw493'>Walt 493</a> Beauty-obsessed, I did not go<br>
to the Goodness-Giver, Great Friend,<br>
suspecting he’d be unfriendly;<br>
I am confessing that offense.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw79'>Verse 79</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw494'>Walt 494</a> And then the One with Honeyed Speech,<br>
the Great Compassionate Victor<br>
sprinkling me with ambrosia said,<br>
“Khemā, you should stay <span class='add'>here with us</span>.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw80'>Verse 80</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw495'>Walt 495</a> Then after bowing down <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
having circumambulated,<br>
having gone, having seen the king,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him just then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw81'>Verse 81</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw496'>Walt 496</a> “O conqueror of enemies,<br>
the righteous trick that you thought up!<br>
Wishing to see the grove, I saw<br>
the Sage, the One Free of Craving. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw82'>Verse 82</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw497'>Walt 497</a> If it’s pleasing to you, O king,<br>
I’ll go forth in the Neutral One’s<br>
dispensation, tired of beauty,<br>
because of what the Sage told <span class='add'>me</span>.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw83'>Verse 83</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw498'>Walt 498</a> Then pressing <span class='add'>his</span> hands together<br>
<span class='add'>the king,</span> the lord of the earth, said,<br>
“I permit you, O lucky one.<br>
Let your going forth have success!” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw84'>Verse 84</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw499'>Walt 499</a> And then after my going forth,<br>
when I had served for seven months,<br>
watching lamp <span class='add'>flames</span> rising, falling,<br>
my mind being profoundly moved, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw85'>Verse 85</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw500'>Walt 500</a> fed up with all conditioned things,<br>
skillful in the heaps of causes,<br>
passing over the four-fold flood,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw86'>Verse 86</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw501'>Walt 501</a> I’d mastered the superpower<br>
<span class='add'>called</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I also was a master of<br>
the knowledge stored in others’ hearts. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw87'>Verse 87</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw502'>Walt 502</a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw88'>Verse 88</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw503'>Walt 503</a> In the Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> have purified <span class='add'>my</span> knowledge<br>
of meaning and of the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw89'>Verse 89</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw504'>Walt 504</a> Skilled in the purifications,<br>
confident in <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Kathāvatthu</i>,<br>
and in the dispensation I’ve<br>
mastered Abhidhammic method. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw90'>Verse 90</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw505'>Walt 505</a> Then, being asked subtle questions<br>
in Toraṇavatthu, by the<br>
queen, wife of the Kosala <span class='add'>king,</span><br>
I explained according to truth. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw91'>Verse 91</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw506'>Walt 506</a> At that time the king, approaching<br>
the Well-Gone-One asked <span class='add'>him as well</span>.<br>
Then the Buddha explained just as<br>
<span class='add'>those questions</span> were explained by me. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw92'>Verse 92</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw507'>Walt 507</a> The Victor, thrilled at that virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in the foremost place;<br>
the Ultimate Man <span class='add'>then dubbed</span> me<br>
“chief of the nuns with great wisdom.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw93'>Verse 93</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw508'>Walt 508</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw94'>Verse 94</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw509'>Walt 509</a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw95'>Verse 95</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw510'>Walt 510</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw96'>Verse 96</a></p>
