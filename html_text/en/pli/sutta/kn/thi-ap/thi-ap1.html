<p class='namo'>Praise Him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Fully Complete Buddha</p>
<p>Now listen to the legends of the Therīs:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1'></a> When Koṇāgamana, Blessed One,<br>
was in his new dwelling, monastic ashram,<br>
<span class='add'>we</span> who were three female friends, <span class='add'>then</span><br>
donated a monastery. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw2'></a> Ten times <span class='add'>and then</span> a hundred times,<br>
and then a hundred hundred times,<br>
we were reborn among the gods;<br>
who could tell the human rebirths? <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw3'></a> Among gods we had vast power;<br>
who could tell the human <span class='add'>power</span>?<br>
Chief queen of a seven-gemmer,<br>
I was the gem of a woman. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw4'></a> Here with wholesome <span class='add'>karma</span> heaped up,<br>
<span class='add'>we’re</span> people from successful clans:<br>
Dhanañjānī and Khemā too,<br>
along with me, the women three. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw5'></a> Making that hermitage well-made,<br>
with every part <span class='add'>of it</span> adorned,<br>
delighted we donated <span class='add'>it</span><br>
to the Buddha-led Assembly. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw6'></a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
in accordance with that karma,<br>
among the gods and humans too,<br>
I attain the foremost station. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw7'></a> In this <span class='add'>present</span> lucky aeon<br>
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> known as Kassapa<br>
was born, the Best of Debaters. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw8'></a> The attendant of the Great Sage<br>
was the ruler of men back then,<br>
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,<br>
in Benares, greatest city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw9'></a> That <span class='add'>ruler</span> had seven daughters,<br>
royal maidens raised in comfort.<br>
Fond of waiting on the Buddha,<br>
they practiced the religious life. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw10'></a> Being the ally of those <span class='add'>girls</span>,<br>
steadfast in the moral precepts,<br>
giving gifts <span class='add'>very</span> carefully,<br>
I practiced vows while in the house.<a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw11'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw12'></a> Fallen thence, I went to Yāma,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then I went to Tusitā,<br>
and then to Nimmānarati,<br>
and then Vāsavatti City. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw13'></a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
steadfast in <span class='add'>doing</span> good karma,<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of the kings in all those <span class='add'>heavens</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw14'></a> Fallen then into humanness,<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of kings who turned the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span><br>
and kings <span class='add'>commanding</span> large regions. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw15'></a> Having experienced happiness<br>
among gods and also humans,<br>
being comfortable everywhere,<br>
I traveled on through several births. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw16'></a> That <span class='add'>gift’s</span> the reason, that’s the cause,<br>
root, patience for the dispensation,<br>
the first identification,<br>
nirvana of this <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-lover. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw17'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw18'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw19'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus indeed Venerable Bhikkhunī Sumedhā spoke these verses.</p>
