<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw882'></a> The Victor Padumuttara<br>
was One With Eyes for everything.<br>
<span class='add'>That</span> Leader <span class='add'>of the World</span> was born<br>
one hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw883'></a> There was then in Haṃsavatī,<br>
a leader known as Videha,<br>
a millionaire with many gems;<br>
I was the wife of him <span class='add'>back then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw884'></a> Once, accompanied by servants,<br>
he went up to the Human Sun,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> listened to Buddha’s Teaching,<br>
causing all suffering to end. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw885'></a> The Leader praised the follower<br>
who was top in austerities;<br>
hearing, he gave alms for a week<br>
to the Buddha, the Neutral One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw886'></a> Bowing <span class='add'>his</span> head at <span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> feet,<br>
he aspired to that <span class='add'>foremost</span> place,<br>
causing his retinue to smile.<br>
Right then <span class='add'>that</span> Bull Among People <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw887'></a> having pitied the millionaire,<br>
spoke these verses <span class='add'>aloud to him</span>:<br>
“You will attain the wished-for state;<br>
o son you’ll achieve nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw888'></a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw889'></a> Worthy heir to that one’s Dhamma,<br>
Dhamma’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Kassapa<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw890'></a> Gladdened after having heard that,<br>
as long as <span class='add'>he</span> lived <span class='add'>he</span> then served<br>
with requisites the Victor, Guide,<br>
with a heart that was <span class='add'>full</span> of love. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw891'></a> Lighting up the Dispensation,<br>
Crushing the Dirty Heretics,<br>
Instructing those who Could be Taught,<br>
he passed on with his followers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw892'></a> When that World-Chief reached nirvana,<br>
assembling <span class='add'>his</span> kinsmen and friends<br>
to do pūjā to the Teacher,<br>
with them <span class='add'>he then</span> had constructed <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw893'></a> a stupa which was made of gems,<br>
rising up seven leagues <span class='add'>in height,</span><br>
which blazed forth just as does the sun;<br>
like a regal <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sal</i> tree in bloom. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw894'></a> There <span class='add'>at the stupa,</span> he had made<br>
seven hundred thousand <span class='add'>fine</span> bowls,<br>
with the seven types of gemstone,<br>
they shined brightly like reeds on fire. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw895'></a> <span class='add'>After that</span> he had lamps lit there,<br>
having filled <span class='add'>them</span> with perfumed oil<br>
to do pūjā to the Great Sage,<br>
who pitied every living being. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw896'></a> He had seven hundred thousand<br>
“pots of plenty” constructed <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
which were <span class='add'>all</span> filled up with gemstones<br>
to do pūjā to the Great Seer. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw897'></a> A gold festoon work was raised up,<br>
surrounded by sixty-four jars;<br>
it shined brilliantly with color,<br>
like the day-maker in autumn. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw898'></a> Arches constructed of gemstones<br>
at the four gateways are splendid.<br>
Planks that are made out of gemstones,<br>
raised up beautiful, are splendid. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw899'></a> Ornaments, exquisitely made,<br>
encircle <span class='add'>that stupa,</span> shining.<br>
Banners are raised up <span class='add'>in the sky</span>;<br>
<span class='add'>fashioned out of</span> gemstones, they shine. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw900'></a> That very red shrine made of gems,<br>
well-built and variegated,<br>
shined excessively with color,<br>
like the sun does in the evening. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw901'></a> The stupa had three terraces;<br>
one he filled with yellow ointment,<br>
one with red-colored arsenic,<br>
one with black collyrium paste. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw902'></a> Having performed pūjā like that,<br>
lovely, for the Excellent One,<br>
he gave the monks’ community<br>
alms, much as he could, his whole life. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw903'></a> Along with that millionaire I,<br>
as long as I lived <span class='add'>also</span> did<br>
those merit-filled deeds thoroughly;<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> with <span class='add'>him</span> I <span class='add'>had</span> good rebirths. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw904'></a> Experiencing happiness,<br>
both as a human and a god,<br>
I was reborn along with him,<br>
like a shadow with the body. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw905'></a> The Leader known as Vipassi<br>
arose ninety-one aeons ago,<br>
<span class='add'>Buddha,</span> Delightful to the Eye,<br>
One With Insight into All Things. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw906'></a> Then he <span class='add'>lived</span> in Bandhumatī,<br>
a brahmin known for excellence,<br>
rich in scripture and religion,<br>
but very poor in terms of wealth. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw907'></a> And at that time, of the same mind,<br>
I was his brahmin woman <span class='add'>wife</span>.<br>
Once that excellent twice-born man<br>
met with the Sage who was So Great, <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw908'></a> seated ‘midst the population,<br>
preaching the state of deathlessness.<br>
Hearing the Dhamma, overjoyed,<br>
he gave his own cloak <span class='add'>to that Sage</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw909'></a> Going home in a single cloth,<br>
he spoke these <span class='add'>words</span> to me <span class='add'>just then</span>:<br>
“Take joy in this great good karma,<br>
the cloak given to the Buddha.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw910'></a> Then clasping hands together I,<br>
well-satisfied, did take delight:<br>
“Husband, this cloak is gifted well<br>
to the Best Buddha, Neutral One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw911'></a> Being happy and <span class='add'>well-</span>prepared,<br>
transmigrating from birth to birth<br>
he was the king, lord of the earth,<br>
in lovely Benares city. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw912'></a> I was the chief queen of that <span class='add'>king</span>,<br>
supreme in his troupe of women.<br>
I was extremely dear to him,<br>
due to past love for <span class='add'>my</span> husband. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw913'></a> Having seen eight Lonely Leaders<br>
going about on <span class='add'>their</span> alms-rounds,<br>
he, having become overjoyed,<br>
gave very costly alms to them. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw914-915'></a> Again having invited <span class='add'>them,</span><br>
having made a gem pavilion,<br>
gathering bowls made by <span class='add'>gold-</span>smiths,<br>
<span class='add'>as too</span> a tray of solid gold,<br>
he then offered to all of them,<br>
who’d gotten up on golden seats,<br>
an almsgiving <span class='add'>most opulent,</span><br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span> pleased by <span class='add'>his</span> own hands. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33-34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw916'></a> I gave that very almsgiving<br>
with the Kāsi king <span class='add'>way</span> back then.<br>
Again I was reborn in a<br>
village outside the Kāsi gates. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw917'></a> He was happy with his brothers,<br>
in a wealthy clan of fam’lies.<br>
I was the eldest brother’s wife,<br>
a woman who fulfilled her vows. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw918'></a> Having seen a Lonely Buddha,<br>
he who was my youngest brother,<br>
gave his portion to <span class='add'>that Buddha</span>;<br>
when he arrived I told <span class='add'>him</span> that. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw919'></a> He did not praise that almsgiving,<br>
so having taken back that food<br>
from Buddha, I gave it to him;<br>
again he gave him it <span class='add'>himself</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw920'></a> Then having thrown away that food,<br>
enraged, I <span class='add'>took back</span> Buddha’s bowl<br>
<span class='add'>a second time,</span> filled it with mud,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> gave it to that Neutral One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw921'></a> And right when he received those alms,<br>
rotten and lacking purity,<br>
his mind was equally happy;<br>
seeing <span class='add'>that,</span> I was very moved. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw922'></a> Again <span class='add'>I</span> took <span class='add'>that</span> bowl <span class='add'>from him</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> cleaned <span class='add'>it</span> with scented perfume.<br>
With <span class='add'>my</span> mind <span class='add'>then</span> full of pleasure,<br>
I gave him ghee respectfully. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw923'></a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
because <span class='add'>I gave</span> alms, I’m gorgeous;<br>
through <span class='add'>giving</span> Buddha tasteless food,<br>
my breath has a horrible stench. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw924'></a> Again when Buddha Kassapa’s<br>
stupa was being completed,<br>
delighted, I <span class='add'>then</span> gave <span class='add'>for it</span><br>
an excellent tile made of gold. <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw925'></a> Through four lifetimes having applied<br>
scented <span class='add'>substances</span> to that tile,<br>
every one of <span class='add'>my</span> limbs was freed<br>
from the defect of bad odor. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw926'></a> Having made seven thousand bowls,<br>
<span class='add'>each adorned</span> with the seven gems<br>
and filled with clarified butter,<br>
placing <span class='add'>in them</span> a thousand wicks, <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw927'></a> with a mind that was very pleased,<br>
I proceeded to light <span class='add'>them all,</span><br>
and laid <span class='add'>them</span> out in seven rows,<br>
to do pūjā to the World’s Lord <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw928'></a> and at that time especially<br>
I had the share in that merit.<br>
Again among the Kāsians<br>
he was Sumitta, well-known sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw929'></a> I was <span class='add'>the Sage Sumitta’s</span> wife,<br>
happy, joyful and <span class='add'>much</span> beloved.<br>
And then he gave <span class='add'>some</span> Lonely Ones<br>
a massive cloak <span class='add'>to use for robes</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw930'></a> <span class='add'>I</span> also shared in that <span class='add'>merit,</span><br>
approving of that great alms gift.<br>
Again in the Kāsi country<br>
he was reborn, a Koliyan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw931'></a> And then, along with five hundred<br>
of the sons of the Koliyans,<br>
he attended upon Lonely<br>
Buddhas, five hundred <span class='add'>in number</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw932'></a> Satisfying <span class='add'>them</span> for three months<br>
he gave <span class='add'>those Buddhas</span> the three robes.<br>
I was then the <span class='add'>Koliyan’s</span> wife,<br>
following <span class='add'>his</span> path of merit. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw933'></a> Fallen from there <span class='add'>he</span> then became<br>
the famous king known as Nanda.<br>
I was <span class='add'>that King Nanda’s</span> chief queen;<br>
my every desire was fulfilled. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw934-935'></a> Fallen from there, having become<br>
Brahmadatta, lord of the earth,<br>
for as long as his life lasted,<br>
he then did attend upon all<br>
the five hundred Lonely Sages<br>
who were Padumavatīs sons.<br>
Dwelling in the royal garden,<br>
I <span class='add'>too</span> worshipped those Gone-Out Ones. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53-54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw936'></a> Both of us having built stupas,<br>
going forth <span class='add'>renouncing the world,</span><br>
experienced the boundless states,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> then we went to Brahma’s world. <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw937'></a> Fallen down to Mahātittha<br>
he’s well-born Pipphalāyana.<br>
Mother: Sumanadevī and<br>
father: brahmin Kosigotta. <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw938'></a> In the Madda country I, was<br>
daughter of brahmin Kapila;<br>
mother was Sucīmatī in<br>
Sāgalā the best of cities. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw939'></a> My father having adorned me<br>
with a thick golden ornament,<br>
gave me to the wise Kassapa,<br>
who’d avoided desire for me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw940'></a> One time that compassionate man,<br>
gone forth wishing for karma’s end,<br>
was moved at seeing some creatures<br>
devoured by crows and such-like <span class='add'>birds</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw941'></a> Then I too in the house was moved,<br>
seeing worms that had been born in<br>
sesame then baked by sun-heat,<br>
being eaten up by <span class='add'>some</span> crows. <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw942'></a> When wise <span class='add'>Kassapa</span> had renounced,<br>
I followed him in renouncing.<br>
For five years I resided <span class='add'>then</span><br>
along the path of renouncers. <a class='vjw' id='vjw61'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw943'></a> When Gotamī, the Victor’s nurse,<br>
had gone forth as a renouncer,<br>
then come together with Buddha,<br>
I <span class='add'>too</span> received <span class='add'>his</span> instruction. <a class='vjw' id='vjw62'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw944'></a> After not a very long time,<br>
I achieved the arahant-state.<br>
O! Being the “beautiful friend”<br>
of the resplendent Kassapa! <a class='vjw' id='vjw63'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw945'></a> The Buddha’s legitimate son,<br>
very attentive, Kassapa,<br>
is one who knows previous births,<br>
and he sees the heavens and hells. <a class='vjw' id='vjw64'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw946'></a> Then birth’s destruction he attained;<br>
special knowledges perfected;<br>
a sage with the three knowledges,<br>
that brahmin’s a triple-knower. <a class='vjw' id='vjw65'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw947'></a> Just so Bhaddā-Kāpilāni,<br>
triple-knower who’s conquered death.<br>
She’s one who wears <span class='add'>her</span> last body,<br>
defeating Māra and his mount. <a class='vjw' id='vjw66'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw948'></a> Seeing the dangers in the world,<br>
we both <span class='add'>went forth</span> as renouncers.<br>
We are now free of defilements;<br>
tamed, cooled off, gone to nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw67'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw949'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw68'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw950'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw69'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw951'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw70'></a></p>
