<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw906'>Walt 906</a> Then he <span class='add' href='#jw906'>Walt 906</a> Then he <span class='add'>lived</span> in Bandhumatī,<br>
a brahmin known for excellence,<br>
rich in scripture and religion,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw907' href='#jw907'>Walt 907</a> And at that time, of the same mind,<br>
I was his brahmin woman <span class='add'>wife</span>.<br>
Once that excellent twice-born man<br>
met with the Sage who was So Great, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26' href='#vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw908' href='#jw908'>Walt 908</a> seated ‘midst the population,<br>
preaching the state of deathlessness.<br>
Hearing the Dhamma, overjoyed,<br>
he gave his own cloak <span class='add'>to that Sage</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27' href='#vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw909' href='#jw909'>Walt 909</a> Going home in a single cloth,<br>
he spoke these <span class='add'>words</span> to me <span class='add'>just then</span>:<br>
“Take joy in this great good karma,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw910' href='#jw910'>Walt 910</a> Then clasping hands together I,<br>
well-satisfied, did take delight:<br>
“Husband, this cloak is gifted well<br>
to the Best Buddha, Neutral One.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29' href='#vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>

transmigrating from birth to birth<br>
he was the king, lord of the earth,<br>
in lovely Benares city. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30' href='#vjw30'>Verse 30</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw912'>Walt 912</a> I was the chief queen of that <span class='add' href='#jw912'>Walt 912</a> I was the chief queen of that <span class='add'>king</span>,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw913' href='#jw913'>Walt 913</a> Having seen eight Lonely Leaders<br>
going about on <span class='add'>their</span> alms-rounds,<br>
he, having become overjoyed,<br>
gave very costly alms to them. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw32' href='#vjw32'>Verse 32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw914-915'>Walt 914-915</a> Again having invited <span class='add' href='#jw914-915'>Walt 914-915</a> Again having invited <span class='add'>them,</span><br>
having made a gem pavilion,<br>
gathering bowls made by <span class='add'>gold-</span>smiths,<br>
<span class='add'>as too</span> a tray of solid gold,<br>
he then offered to all of them,<br>
who’d gotten up on golden seats,<br>
an almsgiving <span class='add'>most opulent,</span><br>
<span class='add'>feeling well-</span> pleased by <span class='add'>his</span> own hands. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33-34' href='#vjw33-34'>Verse 33-34</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw916' href='#jw916'>Walt 916</a> I gave that very almsgiving<br>
with the Kāsi king <span class='add'>way</span> back then.<br>
Again I was reborn in a<br>
village outside the Kāsi gates. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw35' href='#vjw35'>Verse 35</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw917' href='#jw917'>Walt 917</a> He was happy with his brothers,<br>
in a wealthy clan of fam’lies.<br>
I was the eldest brother’s wife,<br>
a woman who fulfilled her vows. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw36' href='#vjw36'>Verse 36</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw918' href='#jw918'>Walt 918</a> Having seen a Lonely Buddha,<br>
he who was my youngest brother,<br>
gave his portion to <span class='add'>that Buddha</span>;<br>
when he arrived I told <span class='add'>him</span> that. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw37' href='#vjw37'>Verse 37</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw919' href='#jw919'>Walt 919</a> He did not praise that almsgiving,<br>
so having taken back that food<br>
from Buddha, I gave it to him;<br>
again he gave him it <span class='add'>himself</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw38' href='#vjw38'>Verse 38</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw920' href='#jw920'>Walt 920</a> Then having thrown away that food,<br>
enraged, I <span class='add'>took back</span> Buddha’s bowl<br>
<span class='add'>a second time,</span> filled it with mud,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> gave it to that Neutral One. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw39' href='#vjw39'>Verse 39</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw921' href='#jw921'>Walt 921</a> And right when he received those alms,<br>
rotten and lacking purity,<br>
his mind was equally happy;<br>
seeing <span class='add'>that,</span> I was very moved. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw40' href='#vjw40'>Verse 40</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw922'>Walt 922</a> Again <span class='add'>I</span> took <span class='add'>that</span> bowl <span class='add' href='#jw922'>Walt 922</a> Again <span class='add'>I</span> took <span class='add'>that</span> bowl <span class='add'>from him</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> cleaned <span class='add'>it</span> with scented perfume.<br>
With <span class='add'>my</span> mind <span class='add'>then</span> full of pleasure,<br>
I gave him ghee respectfully. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw41' href='#vjw41'>Verse 41</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw923' href='#jw923'>Walt 923</a> In whichever place I’m reborn,<br>
because <span class='add'>I gave</span> alms, I’m gorgeous;<br>
through <span class='add'>giving</span> Buddha tasteless food,<br>
my breath has a horrible stench. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw42' href='#vjw42'>Verse 42</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw924' href='#jw924'>Walt 924</a> Again when Buddha Kassapa’s<br>
stupa was being completed,<br>
delighted, I <span class='add'>then</span> gave <span class='add'>for it</span><br>
an excellent tile made of gold. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw43' href='#vjw43'>Verse 43</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw925' href='#jw925'>Walt 925</a> Through four lifetimes having applied<br>
scented <span class='add'>substances</span> to that tile,<br>
every one of <span class='add'>my</span> limbs was freed<br>
from the defect of bad odor. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw44' href='#vjw44'>Verse 44</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw926' href='#jw926'>Walt 926</a> Having made seven thousand bowls,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw927' href='#jw927'>Walt 927</a> with a mind that was very pleased,<br>
I proceeded to light <span class='add'>them all,</span><br>
and laid <span class='add'>them</span> out in seven rows,<br>
to do pūjā to the World’s Lord <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw46' href='#vjw46'>Verse 46</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw928' href='#jw928'>Walt 928</a> and at that time especially<br>
I had the share in that merit.<br>
Again among the Kāsians<br>
he was Sumitta, well-known sage. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw47' href='#vjw47'>Verse 47</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw929'>Walt 929</a> I was <span class='add' href='#jw929'>Walt 929</a> I was <span class='add'>the Sage Sumitta’s</span> wife,<br>

And then he gave <span class='add'>some</span> Lonely Ones<br>
a massive cloak <span class='add'>to use for robes</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw48' href='#vjw48'>Verse 48</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw930'>Walt 930</a> <span class='add'>I</span> also shared in that <span class='add' href='#jw930'>Walt 930</a> <span class='add'>I</span> also shared in that <span class='add'>merit,</span><br>

he was reborn, a Koliyan. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw49' href='#vjw49'>Verse 49</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw931' href='#jw931'>Walt 931</a> And then, along with five hundred<br>
of the sons of the Koliyans,<br>
he attended upon Lonely<br>
Buddhas, five hundred <span class='add'>in number</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw50' href='#vjw50'>Verse 50</a></p>

he gave <span class='add'>those Buddhas</span> the three robes.<br>
I was then the <span class='add'>Koliyan’s</span> wife,<br>
following <span class='add'>his</span> path of merit. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw51' href='#vjw51'>Verse 51</a></p>

I was <span class='add'>that King Nanda’s</span> chief queen;<br>
my every desire was fulfilled. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw52' href='#vjw52'>Verse 52</a></p>

he then did attend upon all<br>
the five hundred Lonely Sages<br>
who were Padumavatīs sons.<br>
Dwelling in the royal garden,<br>
I <span class='add'>too</span> worshipped those Gone-Out Ones. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw53-54' href='#vjw53-54'>Verse 53-54</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw936' href='#jw936'>Walt 936</a> Both of us having built stupas,<br>
going forth <span class='add'>renouncing the world,</span><br>
experienced the boundless states,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw940' href='#jw940'>Walt 940</a> One time that compassionate man,<br>
gone forth wishing for karma’s end,<br>
was moved at seeing some creatures<br>
devoured by crows and such-like <span class='add'>birds</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw59' href='#vjw59'>Verse 59</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw941' href='#jw941'>Walt 941</a> Then I too in the house was moved,<br>
