<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1307'>Walt 1307</a> The Great Sage was Phussa <span class='add'>Buddha,</span><br>
<span class='add'>like</span> a garland of speckled rays.<br>
I was <span class='add'>that Buddha’s own</span> sister,<br>
born in <span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> kṣatriyan clan. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1308'>Walt 1308</a> Having listened to his Teaching,<br>
with a mind that was very clear,<br>
giving <span class='add'>him</span> a large alms-giving<br>
I aspired to achieve beauty. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1309'>Walt 1309</a> Thirty-one aeons in the past,<br>
Sikhi, Chief Leader of the World,<br>
arose, the <span class='add'>Bright</span> Lamp of the World,<br>
the Three Worlds’ Refuge, the Victor. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1310'>Walt 1310</a> I’m then born in a brahmin clan,<br>
in lovely Āruṇa City.<br>
Angered <span class='add'>about something,</span> I cursed<br>
a nun with liberated mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1311-1312'>Walt 1311-1312</a> Misbehaved like a prostitute,<br>
I dirtied the dispensation.<br>
Having thus cursed <span class='add'>the nun</span> like that,<br>
because of that evil karma,<br>
I went to a horrific hell,<br>
full of terrible suffering.<br>
Fallen from there, <span class='add'>again</span> reborn<br>
human, I was an ascetic. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5-6'>Verse 5-6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1313'>Walt 1313</a> For ten thousand <span class='add'>different</span> lifetimes,<br>
I was fixed in prostitution;<br>
thus I was not freed from evil,<br>
as though <span class='add'>I’d</span> eaten strong poison. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1314'>Walt 1314</a> In Kassapa’s dispensation,<br>
I practiced celibate <span class='add'>nunhood</span>.<br>
Due to that karma, I was born<br>
in the city of the thirty. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1315'>Walt 1315</a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
come to be spontaneously,<br>
I was born amidst mango boughs;<br>
therefore I was “Mango-Guarded.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1316'>Walt 1316</a> Along with ten million beings,<br>
gone forth in the dispensation,<br>
I attained the unshaking state,<br>
Buddha’s legitimate daughter. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1317'>Walt 1317</a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1318'>Walt 1318</a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1319'>Walt 1319</a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1320'>Walt 1320</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1321'>Walt 1321</a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1322'>Walt 1322</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
