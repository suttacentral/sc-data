<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw190'></a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was a wanderer back then.<br>
From ashram to monastery,<br>
I wandered desiring the good. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw191'></a> One day when the moon was waning,<br>
I saw the supreme Bodhi <span class='add'>Tree</span>.<br>
Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> heart there,<br>
I sat down at that Bodhi’s roots. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw192'></a> Standing, with a heart of reverence,<br>
hands pressed together on <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
knowing mental happiness <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
I then reflected in this way: <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw193'></a> “If <span class='add'>he</span> has limitless virtue,<br>
is unique, without a rival,<br>
let Buddha show me a marvel;<br>
let him make this Bodhi <span class='add'>Tree</span> shine.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw194'></a> When I made that aspiration,<br>
the Bodhi Tree did then blaze up.<br>
It shined forth in all directions,<br>
displaying every good color. <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw195'></a> Seven nights and days I sat there,<br>
at the roots of that Bodhi <span class='add'>Tree</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> when the seventh day arrived,<br>
I made an offering of lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw196'></a> Setting them around my seat <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
I <span class='add'>proceeded to</span> light five lamps.<br>
<span class='add'>And</span> then my lamps <span class='add'>all remained</span> lit,<br>
until the sun did rise <span class='add'>again</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw197'></a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw198'></a> There my well-made divine mansion<br>
was known as “Pañcadīpī” then.<br>
It was <span class='add'>full</span> sixty leagues in height,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> thirty leagues in width back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw199'></a> Uncountable numbers of lamps<br>
are burning in my surroundings.<br>
The divine world is <span class='add'>then</span> lit up<br>
with lamp-light, up to its edges. <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw200'></a> If when standing looking eastward,<br>
I should desire to see <span class='add'>something</span>,<br>
above, below, also across,<br>
I see everything with <span class='add'>my</span> eyes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw201'></a> As far as I should wish to see,<br>
things well done and things not well done,<br>
there’s no obstruction <span class='add'>to my sight</span><br>
in the trees and the mountains there. <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw202'></a> I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of eighty kings among the gods.<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of one hundred wheel-turning kings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw203'></a> In whichever womb I’m reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
in my surroundings, a <span class='add'>whole</span> lakh<br>
of lamps are burning <span class='add'>there</span> for me. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw204'></a> Fallen from the world of the gods,<br>
I was born in a mother’s womb.<br>
While I was in that mother’s womb<br>
my eyes were open all the time. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw205'></a> Due to my having good karma,<br>
an <span class='add'>entire</span> hundred thousand lamps<br>
are lit in the lying-in room:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw206'></a> When my final rebirth occurred,<br>
I turned <span class='add'>my</span> mind away <span class='add'>from lust</span>.<br>
I attained the unaging <span class='add'>and</span><br>
undying cool state, nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw207'></a> <span class='add'>When</span> I was <span class='add'>but</span> seven years old,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.<br>
The Buddha ordained <span class='add'>me right then</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw208'></a> Meditating on a platform,<br>
beneath a tree, empty spots,<br>
a lamp is always burning there:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw209'></a> My “divine eye” is purified;<br>
I am skilled in concentration.<br>
I excel in special knowledges:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw210'></a> Every achievement is achieved;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> duty’s done, <span class='add'>I’m</span> undefiled.<br>
Five Lamps is <span class='add'>now</span> worshipping <span class='add'>your</span><br>
feet, Great Hero, o Eyeful One. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw211'></a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave <span class='add'>him</span> those lamps back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw212'></a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw213'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw214'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
