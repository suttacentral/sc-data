<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw190'>Walt 190</a> In the city, Haṃsavatī,<br>
I was a wanderer back then.<br>
From ashram to monastery,<br>
I wandered desiring the good. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw191'>Walt 191</a> One day when the moon was waning,<br>
I saw the supreme Bodhi <span class='add'>Tree</span>.<br>
Bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> heart there,<br>
I sat down at that Bodhi’s roots. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw192'>Walt 192</a> Standing, with a heart of reverence,<br>
hands pressed together on <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
knowing mental happiness <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
I then reflected in this way: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw193'>Walt 193</a> “If <span class='add'>he</span> has limitless virtue,<br>
is unique, without a rival,<br>
let Buddha show me a marvel;<br>
let him make this Bodhi <span class='add'>Tree</span> shine.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw194'>Walt 194</a> When I made that aspiration,<br>
the Bodhi Tree did then blaze up.<br>
It shined forth in all directions,<br>
displaying every good color. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw195'>Walt 195</a> Seven nights and days I sat there,<br>
at the roots of that Bodhi <span class='add'>Tree</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> when the seventh day arrived,<br>
I made an offering of lamps. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw196'>Walt 196</a> Setting them around my seat <span class='add'>there,</span><br>
I <span class='add'>proceeded to</span> light five lamps.<br>
<span class='add'>And</span> then my lamps <span class='add'>all remained</span> lit,<br>
until the sun did rise <span class='add'>again</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw197'>Walt 197</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw198'>Walt 198</a> There my well-made divine mansion<br>
was known as “Pañcadīpī” then.<br>
It was <span class='add'>full</span> sixty leagues in height,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> thirty leagues in width back then. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw199'>Walt 199</a> Uncountable numbers of lamps<br>
are burning in my surroundings.<br>
The divine world is <span class='add'>then</span> lit up<br>
with lamp-light, up to its edges. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw200'>Walt 200</a> If when standing looking eastward,<br>
I should desire to see <span class='add'>something</span>,<br>
above, below, also across,<br>
I see everything with <span class='add'>my</span> eyes. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw201'>Walt 201</a> As far as I should wish to see,<br>
things well done and things not well done,<br>
there’s no obstruction <span class='add'>to my sight</span><br>
in the trees and the mountains there. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw202'>Walt 202</a> I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of eighty kings among the gods.<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of one hundred wheel-turning kings. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw203'>Walt 203</a> In whichever womb I’m reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
in my surroundings, a <span class='add'>whole</span> lakh<br>
of lamps are burning <span class='add'>there</span> for me. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw204'>Walt 204</a> Fallen from the world of the gods,<br>
I was born in a mother’s womb.<br>
While I was in that mother’s womb<br>
my eyes were open all the time. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw205'>Walt 205</a> Due to my having good karma,<br>
an <span class='add'>entire</span> hundred thousand lamps<br>
are lit in the lying-in room:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw206'>Walt 206</a> When my final rebirth occurred,<br>
I turned <span class='add'>my</span> mind away <span class='add'>from lust</span>.<br>
I attained the unaging <span class='add'>and</span><br>
undying cool state, nirvana. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw207'>Walt 207</a> <span class='add'>When</span> I was <span class='add'>but</span> seven years old,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship.<br>
The Buddha ordained <span class='add'>me right then</span>:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw208'>Walt 208</a> Meditating on a platform,<br>
beneath a tree, empty spots,<br>
a lamp is always burning there:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw209'>Walt 209</a> My “divine eye” is purified;<br>
I am skilled in concentration.<br>
I excel in special knowledges:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw210'>Walt 210</a> Every achievement is achieved;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> duty’s done, <span class='add'>I’m</span> undefiled.<br>
Five Lamps is <span class='add'>now</span> worshipping <span class='add'>your</span><br>
feet, Great Hero, o Eyeful One. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw211'>Walt 211</a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave <span class='add'>him</span> those lamps back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> five lamps. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw212'>Walt 212</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw213'>Walt 213</a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw214'>Walt 214</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
