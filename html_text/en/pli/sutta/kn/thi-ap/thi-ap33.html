<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1160'>Walt 1160</a> In Aruṇavatī City,<br>
<span class='add'>lived</span> the kṣatriyan Aruṇa.<br>
I was <span class='add'>then</span> the wife of that king;<br>
in that place I was practicing. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1161'>Walt 1161</a> Gone off alone <span class='add'>and</span> sitting down,<br>
I then reflected <span class='add'>on it</span> like this:<br>
“there’s no good karma done by me<br>
to take along on my journey. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1162'>Walt 1162</a> Am I not then going to hell,<br>
burning red hot, very cruel,<br>
with a gruesome form, and bitter?<br>
For me there’s no doubt about that.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1163'>Walt 1163</a> Having thought <span class='add'>it through</span> in that way.<br>
bringing pleasure to <span class='add'>my own</span> mind,<br>
after going up to the king,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>entreating him:</span> <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1164'>Walt 1164</a> “O king, we <span class='add'>who are</span> called “women”<br>
always follow behind <span class='add'>our</span> men.<br>
Give me a single Buddhist monk;<br>
I shall feed <span class='add'>him,</span> O kṣatriyan.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1165'>Walt 1165</a> At that time the king gave to me<br>
a monk with senses <span class='add'>well-</span>controlled.<br>
After picking up his alms bowl,<br>
I filled <span class='add'>it</span> with exquisite food. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1166'>Walt 1166</a> Filling it with exquisite food,<br>
having removed a fine garment<br>
which was valued at a thousand,<br>
I gave it with a happy mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1167'>Walt 1167</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṃsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1168'>Walt 1168</a> I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of one thousand kings of the gods.<br>
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place<br>
of one thousand wheel-turning kings. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1169'>Walt 1169</a> <span class='add'>There was also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting,<br>
<span class='add'>and there was</span> much other, varied<br>
fruit of that karma thereafter. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1170'>Walt 1170</a> I’m <span class='add'>always</span> blue lotus-colored,<br>
very beautiful, good-looking,<br>
a woman endowed in all parts,<br>
of noble birth <span class='add'>and</span> radiant. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1171'>Walt 1171</a> When <span class='add'>my</span> last rebirth was attained<br>
I was born in the Śākyan clan,<br>
leader of one thousand women<br>
<span class='add'>attached</span> to Suddhodana’s son. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1172'>Walt 1172</a> Becoming wearied in the home,<br>
I went forth into homelessness.<br>
Before the seventh night occurred<br>
I attained the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1173'>Walt 1173</a> I cannot count <span class='add'>the gifts received,</span><br>
monastic robes and alms to eat,<br>
requisites <span class='add'>as well as</span> lodgings:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> alms food. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1174'>Walt 1174</a> O Sage, recall the good karma,<br>
which formerly <span class='add'>was done</span> by me;<br>
much of mine has been sacrificed<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1175'>Walt 1175</a> In the thirty-one aeons since<br>
I gave that alms-giving back then,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> alms food. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1176'>Walt 1176</a> I transmigrate in <span class='add'>just</span> two states:<br>
as a goddess or a woman.<br>
I do not know other rebirths;<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> alms food. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1177'>Walt 1177</a> <span class='add'>When human</span> I‘m born in high clans,<br>
which have big halls, very wealthy;<br>
I do not witness lesser clans:<br>
that’s the fruit of <span class='add'>giving</span> alms food. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1178'>Walt 1178</a> Transmigrating life after life,<br>
incited by <span class='add'>my</span> wholesome roots,<br>
I do not see what does not please:<br>
fruit <span class='add'>of deeds</span> done with happy mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1179'>Walt 1179</a> I’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
I’m also a master, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1180'>Walt 1180</a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1181'>Walt 1181</a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of mine was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1182'>Walt 1182</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1183'>Walt 1183</a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1184'>Walt 1184</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
