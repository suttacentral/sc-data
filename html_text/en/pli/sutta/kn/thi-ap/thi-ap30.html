<h1>30. Eighteen Thousand Buddhist Nuns Headed Up by Yasodharā</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1044'></a> Buddhist nuns, eighteen thousand <span class='add'>strong,</span><br>
<span class='add'>who were</span> born in the Śākyan <span class='add'>clan</span>,<br>
headed up by Yasodharā,<br>
went up to <span class='add'>him,</span> the Sambuddha. <a class='vjw' id='vjw1'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1045'></a> All those eighteen thousand women<br>
are superpower-possessors.<br>
Worshipping the feet of the Sage,<br>
they’re announcing their strength’s extent. <a class='vjw' id='vjw2'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1046'></a> "Birth is destroyed, old age, disease,<br>
and death is <span class='add'>as well,</span> O Great Sage;<br>
Guide, we travel the peaceful path,<br>
deathless and without defilement. <a class='vjw' id='vjw3'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1047'></a> If there’s trouble in the city,<br>
even for everyone, Great Sage,<br>
they <span class='add'>all</span> know <span class='add'>our</span> imperfections;<br>
Leader, <span class='add'>give us your</span> forgive<span class='add'>ness</span>.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw4'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1048'></a> "<span class='add'>Now</span> display <span class='add'>your</span> superpowers,<br>
doers of my dispensation;<br>
to that extent cut off the doubt<br>
among all of the assemblies.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw5'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1049'></a> "We’re Yasodharās, Great Hero;<br>
desirable, speaking sweet words.<br>
<span class='add'>And</span> in the home, O Great Hero,<br>
<span class='add'>we</span> all <span class='add'>were fixed as</span> your chief queens. <a class='vjw' id='vjw6'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1050'></a> In your household, O Hero, we<br>
were the leaders, the lords of all<br>
of the <span class='add'>women there, who numbered</span><br>
one hundred thousand ninety six. <a class='vjw' id='vjw7'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1051'></a> <span class='add'>All us women are</span> endowed with<br>
the virtues of beauty and grace;<br>
youthful, well-spoken, we’re revered,<br>
like gods <span class='add'>are revered by</span> people. <a class='vjw' id='vjw8'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1052'></a> All <span class='add'>us</span> eighteen thousand <span class='add'>women,</span><br>
born in the clan of the Śākyas,<br>
are famous ones, <span class='add'>Yasodharās,</span><br>
the leaders of thousands back then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw9'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1053'></a> Beyond the essence of desire,<br>
fixed as the essence of beauty,<br>
<span class='add'>we’re</span> unmatched in terms of beauty<br>
among <span class='add'>other</span> thousands, Great Sage.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw10'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1054'></a> Worshipping the Sambuddha, they<br>
showed the Teacher superpowers.<br>
They displayed great superpowers,<br>
diverse, having various forms. <a class='vjw' id='vjw11'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1055'></a> Body big as the universe,<br>
they <span class='add'>made</span> the continent up north<br>
<span class='add'>their</span> head<span class='add'>s</span>; both other islands wings;<br>
<span class='add'>and made</span> India <span class='add'>their</span> torso<span class='add'>s</span>; <a class='vjw' id='vjw12'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1056'></a> tail feathers: the southern ocean;<br>
<span class='add'>other</span> feathers: varied rivers;<br>
<span class='add'>their</span> eyes were the moon and the sun,<br>
<span class='add'>their</span> crests <span class='add'>were</span> cosmic Mount Meru. <a class='vjw' id='vjw13'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1057'></a> <span class='add'>In their</span> beak<span class='add'>s</span>, mountain at world’s end,<br>
<span class='add'>they carried</span> a tree with its roots.<br>
Coming up to <span class='add'>him,</span> fanning <span class='add'>him,</span><br>
they’re worshipping the World’s Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw14'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1058'></a> <span class='add'>Then</span> they made themselves elephants,<br>
likewise horses, mountains, oceans,<br>
the moon and the sun, Mount Meru,<br>
and Śakra, <span class='add'>the king of the gods</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw15'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1059'></a> "We’re like Yasodharās, Hero;<br>
We worship <span class='add'>your</span> feet, Eyeful One.<br>
Through your majesty, Hero,<br>
we’re perfected, Leader of Men. <a class='vjw' id='vjw16'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1060'></a> We’ve mastered the superpowers<br>
<span class='add'>like</span> the “divine ear” element.<br>
We’re also the masters, Great Sage,<br>
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. <a class='vjw' id='vjw17'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1061'></a> We remember <span class='add'>our</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>our</span> “divine eye<span class='add'>s</span>” are purified.<br>
All the defilements are destroyed;<br>
<span class='add'>we</span> will not be reborn again. <a class='vjw' id='vjw18'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1062'></a> In meaning and in the Teaching,<br>
etymology and preaching,<br>
<span class='add'>this</span> knowledge of ours was produced<br>
in your presence, O Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw19'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1063'></a> Our meeting with <span class='add'>all</span> the Buddhas,<br>
the World-Lords, was displayed <span class='add'>to you</span>;<br>
our extensive service <span class='add'>to them</span><br>
was for the sake of you, Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw20'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1064'></a> O Sage, recall the good karma,<br>
which formerly <span class='add'>was done</span> by us;<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> merit was heaped up by us<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw21'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1065'></a> We kept from misconduct, hindered<br>
the <span class='add'>nine</span> impossible places;<br>
we have sacrificed life <span class='add'>itself</span><br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw22'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1066'></a> We were given to be <span class='add'>your</span> wives,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
We were not distressed about that,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw23'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1067'></a> We were given to do service,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
We were not distressed about that,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw24'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1068'></a> We were given to <span class='add'>provide</span> food,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
We were not distressed about that,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw25'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1069'></a> We have given you <span class='add'>all our</span> lives,<br>
several tens of billions <span class='add'>of times</span>.<br>
We’ll liberate <span class='add'>ourselves</span> from fear,<br>
giving up our lives <span class='add'>once more</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw26'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1070'></a> Great Sage for your sake we do not<br>
conceal the things of a woman,<br>
numerous clothes of varied types,<br>
ornaments affixed to <span class='add'>our</span> limbs. <a class='vjw' id='vjw27'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1071'></a> Wealth and grain have been given up,<br>
villages and also small towns,<br>
fields and sons and daughters <span class='add'>as well</span><br>
have been given up, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw28'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1072'></a> Elephants, horses, also cows,<br>
slaves <span class='add'>as well as</span> servant-women<br>
are given up beyond all count,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw29'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1073'></a> Whatever we are told <span class='add'>to give</span><br>
as alms to beggars, we give <span class='add'>that</span>;<br>
we don’t witness any distress<br>
from giving the ultimate gift. <a class='vjw' id='vjw30'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1074'></a> <span class='add'>We have</span> experienced dis-ease<br>
of diverse types, beyond all count,<br>
in <span class='add'>this</span> much-varied existence<br>
for the sake of you, Great Hero. <a class='vjw' id='vjw31'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1075'></a> Attaining comfort<span class='add'>s,</span> we don’t thrill;<br>
<span class='add'>We do</span>n’t get distressed by troubles.<br>
Everywhere we remain balanced<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. <a class='vjw' id='vjw32'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1076'></a> After experiencing <span class='add'>both</span><br>
pleasure <span class='add'>and</span> pain along the way,<br>
the Great Sage reached Awakening,<br>
the Teaching for which Buddha strived. <a class='vjw' id='vjw33'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1077'></a> By you <span class='add'>and</span> by us there was much<br>
meeting with the other World-Lords,<br>
<span class='add'>whether you’re</span> the god Brahmā or<br>
Gotama Buddha, World’s Leader. <a class='vjw' id='vjw34'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1078'></a> We performed a lot of service,<br>
for the sake of you, O Great Sage;<br>
while you sought the Buddha's Teaching,<br>
we were <span class='add'>always</span> your attendants. <a class='vjw' id='vjw35'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1079'></a> One hundred thousand aeons <span class='add'>and</span><br>
four incalculable <span class='add'>aeons</span><br>
hence, Dīpaṅkara, Great Hero,<br>
the Leader of the World was born. <a class='vjw' id='vjw36'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1080'></a> <span class='add'>Some</span>place in a nearby country,<br>
inviting <span class='add'>him,</span> the Thus-Gone-One,<br>
happy-minded folks are cleaning<br>
the road <span class='add'>on which</span> he is coming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw37'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1081'></a> At that time there was a brahmin,<br>
<span class='add'>known by</span> the name of Sumedha.<br>
He was making the road ready<br>
for the All-Seer who was coming. <a class='vjw' id='vjw38'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1082'></a> At that time we all were maidens,<br>
who had been born in brahmin <span class='add'>clans</span>;<br>
we carried to that assembly<br>
flowers grown in water, on land. <a class='vjw' id='vjw39'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1083'></a> Just then the Greatly Famed Buddha,<br>
Dīpaṅkara, the Great Hero,<br>
prophesied <span class='add'>future Buddhahood</span><br>
<span class='add'>for that</span> sage with a lofty mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw40'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1084'></a> The earth together with <span class='add'>its</span> gods<br>
was shaking, roaring <span class='add'>and</span> quaking,<br>
as he was praising his karma<br>
<span class='add'>for that</span> sage with a lofty mind. <a class='vjw' id='vjw41'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1085'></a> Divine maidens, human women,<br>
we and the <span class='add'>whole world</span> with <span class='add'>its</span> gods,<br>
worshipping with various things<br>
to be offered, we made wishes. <a class='vjw' id='vjw42'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1086'></a> The Buddha with the name “Bright Lamp”<br>
prophesied to them <span class='add'>at that time:</span><br>
“Who wished today, they’re going to be,<br>
<span class='add'>reborn together,</span> face-to-face.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw43'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1087'></a> Rejoicing about <span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> speech,<br>
we lived behaving in that way<br>
the Buddha prophesied for us<br>
numberless aeons ago. <a class='vjw' id='vjw44'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1088'></a> We brought pleasure to <span class='add'>our</span> mind<span class='add'>s</span> when<br>
that karma was well done <span class='add'>by us</span>;<br>
we experienced countless wombs,<br>
divine <span class='add'>as well as</span> human <span class='add'>ones</span>. <a class='vjw' id='vjw45'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1089'></a> Undergoing pleasure <span class='add'>and</span> pain,<br>
among gods <span class='add'>and</span> human beings,<br>
when <span class='add'>our</span> last rebirth was attained,<br>
we were born in the Śākyan clan. <a class='vjw' id='vjw46'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1090'></a> Beautiful and very wealthy,<br>
famous and likewise virtuous;<br>
endowed with every attainment,<br>
we’re much-honored among the clans. <a class='vjw' id='vjw47'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1091'></a> Riches, fame, hospitality,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> indulgence in worldly things –<br>
<span class='add'>they</span> do not agitate <span class='add'>our</span> minds;<br>
we have no fear from anything. <a class='vjw' id='vjw48'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1092'></a> We were appointed to attend<br>
on what the Blessed One had said<br>
within the harem of the king<br>
in the kṣatriyan city then. <a class='vjw' id='vjw49'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1093'></a> <span class='add'>We are</span> women who are servants,<br>
and <span class='add'>those</span> who feel pleasure and pain,<br>
and women who declare the facts,<br>
women who are compassionate. <a class='vjw' id='vjw50'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1094'></a> Well-practiced, the Teaching-practice;<br>
that practice is not ill-practiced.<br>
<span class='add'>We’re</span> at ease practicing Teaching,<br>
in this world and in the other. <a class='vjw' id='vjw51'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1095'></a> After abandoning the home,<br>
going forth into homelessness,<br>
when eight months had not yet elapsed,<br>
we attained the Four <span class='add'>Noble</span> Truths. <a class='vjw' id='vjw52'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1096'></a> Like the waves upon the ocean,<br>
<span class='add'>folks</span> are bringing many varied<br>
monastic robes and alms to eat,<br>
requisites <span class='add'>as well as</span> lodgings. <a class='vjw' id='vjw53'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1097'></a> Our defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
we are living without constraint. <a class='vjw' id='vjw54'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1098'></a> Being in Best Buddha's presence<br>
was a very good thing for us.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>we have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw55'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1099'></a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>we have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='vjw' id='vjw56'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1100'></a> Thus many sorts of suffering<br>
and many types of happiness;<br>
the pure life <span class='add'>now</span> has been achieved,<br>
we have obtained all achievements. <a class='vjw' id='vjw57'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1101'></a> Woman who are giving themselves<br>
for the merit of the Great Sage<br>
attain companionship <span class='add'>with him</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> unconditioned nirvana. <a class='vjw' id='vjw58'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1102'></a> The past is thoroughly destroyed,<br>
and the present <span class='add'>and</span> the future;<br>
all of our karma is destroyed:<br>
we worship your feet, Eyeful One.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw59'></a></p>
<p><a class='jw' id='jw1103'></a> “What more can I say to women<br>
who are going to nirvana?<br>
Pacifying conditioned flaws<br>
you should attain the deathless state.” <a class='vjw' id='vjw60'></a></p>
