<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Kāye kāyānupassī.</i> Lit. “Observing the body in the body.” The locative tense in Pāli is often used to indicate reference rather than a literal location – that is, “in” can mean “in terms of”, “in reference to”, “in the context of”, etc.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhammā</i>.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Parimukha</i>. There is much controversy over the proper translation of this term.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Kāya-saṅkhāra.</i> Lit. “body-construct.” The term <i lang='pli' translate='no'>saṅkhāra</i> means “conditional phenomenon.” So the term <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kāya-saṅkhāra</i> appears to mean “the conditional phenomenon of the body.” It is rendered here simply as “body” for the sake of clarity.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Udariya.</i> Stomach contents.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhātu.</i> This is not ‘element’ in terms of physical science, but rather ‘element’ in terms of perceived experience. The four elements refer to the four primary characteristics of physical experiences – namely, solidity, cohesion, temperature, and motion.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Sāmisa.</i> Lit. “with meat”.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Nirāmisa</i>. Lit. “not meat”.</li>

<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Upādāna.</i> When there is desire and attachment in relation to the components of existence, they are called <i lang='pli' translate='no'>pañcūpādānakkhanda</i> – the five components when affected by attachment.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Saṅkhāra.</i> This can be distinguished from the more general term “mind-object” as referring to the more complex formations of mind, such as full-fledged emotions, thoughts, ideas, memories, etc.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Āyatana.</i> Lit. “extending.”</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Bhāvanā</i>. Lit. “bringing into being.” This term is commonly used to refer to meditation.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dukkha</i>. Lit. “hard to endure.” This can refer to any unpleasant experience, from the most mild to the most extreme. It it also used to mean the innate inability of an experience to be completely satisfying.</li>

<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Rāga.</i> This can also mean “passion.”</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Vibhava.</i> Lit. “separation from existence.” In addition to craving for total non-existence, this can also refer to craving to avoid particular states of existence.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Nivisamāna.</i> Lit. “settling down.” This is the same verb used for “taking up residence.”</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Diṭṭhi</i>. Lit. “seen.”</li>

<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Diṭṭheva dhamme aññā.</i> That is, full enlightenment.</li>
