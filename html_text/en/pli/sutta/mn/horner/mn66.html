Āpaṇa was the name of a market town in Aṅguttarāpa. Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for almsfood. When he had walked for alms-food and was returning from the alms-gathering after the meal, he approached a forest-thicket for the day-sojourn. When he had plunged into that forest-thicket, he sat down at the root of a tree for the day-sojourn.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>And the venerable Udāyin also, having dressed in the morning, and taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for almsfood. When he had walked for almsfood and was returning from the almsgathering after the meal, he approached that same forest-thicket for the day-sojourn. When he had plunged into that forest-thicket, he sat down at the root of a tree for the day-sojourn.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Then while the venerable Udāyin was in private seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en120' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Then while the venerable Udāyin was in private seclusion a reasoning arose in his mind thus: <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en120'>PTS vp En 120</a> “Indeed our Lord is a remover of many painful things, indeed our Lord is a bringer of many pleasant things. Indeed our Lord is a remover of many unskilled things, indeed our Lord is a bringer of many skilled things.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then the venerable Udāyin, emerging from his seclusion towards evening, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Udāyin spoke thus to the Lord: “While I, revered sir, was in private seclusion, a reasoning arose in my mind thus: ‘Indeed our Lord is a remover of many painful things, indeed our Lord is a bringer of many pleasant things. Indeed our Lord is a remover of many unskilled things, indeed our Lord is a bringer of many skilled things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>We, revered sir, used to eat in the evening and in the morning and during the day—at a wrong time. Revered sir, the Lord at that time addressed the monks, saying: ‘Please do you, monks, give up eating at this wrong time, during the day.’ I was depressed because of this, revered sir, I was sorry, and thought: ‘The Lord speaks of our giving up that sumptuous food, solid and soft, which the believing householders give us during the day—at the wrong time, and the Well-farer speaks of our rejecting it.’ Those of us, revered sir, who look to the Lord with regard and respect and modesty and fear of blame, gave up such food as this (given) during the day, at the wrong time.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>Then we, revered sir, used to eat in the evening as well as in the morning. It was at this time that the Lord addressed the monks, saying: ‘Please do you, monks, give up eating at this wrong time, during the night.’ I was depressed because of this, revered sir, I was sorry, and thought: ‘The Lord speaks of our giving up that which is reckoned as the more sumptuous of these two meals, and the Well-farer speaks of our rejecting it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>Once upon a time, revered sir, a certain man, having obtained some curry during the day, spoke thus: ‘Come, let us put this aside, and in the evening we will enjoy it all together.’ All cooking, revered sir, is at night, there is little during the day. But those of us, revered sir, who look to the Lord with regard and respect and modesty and fear of blame, gave up such food as this (given) at night, at the wrong time.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>Once upon a time, revered sir, when the monks were walking for almsfood in the dense darkness of the night, they would walk into a pool at the entrance to a village, and they would fall into the dirty pool near <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en121' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>Once upon a time, revered sir, when the monks were walking for almsfood in the dense darkness of the night, they would walk into a pool at the entrance to a village, and they would fall into the dirty pool near <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en121'>PTS vp En 121</a> the village, and they would blunder into a thorny hedge, and they would blunder into a sleeping cow, and they would meet with young men, both those who had committed a crime and those who had not, and women would solicit them against true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>Once upon a time I, revered sir, used to walk for almsfood in the dense darkness of the night, and a certain woman saw me during a lightning flash as she was washing a bowl, and terrified at seeing me, she uttered a scream of horror: ‘How terrible for me, indeed there is a demon after me.’ This said, I, revered sir, said to this woman: ‘Sister, I am not a demon, I am a monk standing for almsfood.’ She said, ‘The monk's father must be dead, the monk's mother must be dead—it were better for you, monk, to have your belly cut out with a sharp butcher' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>Once upon a time I, revered sir, used to walk for almsfood in the dense darkness of the night, and a certain woman saw me during a lightning flash as she was washing a bowl, and terrified at seeing me, she uttered a scream of horror: ‘How terrible for me, indeed there is a demon after me.’ This said, I, revered sir, said to this woman: ‘Sister, I am not a demon, I am a monk standing for almsfood.’ She said, ‘The monk's father must be dead, the monk's mother must be dead—it were better for you, monk, to have your belly cut out with a sharp butcher's knife than to walk for almsfood for the sake of your belly in the dense darkness of the night.’ When I remember this, revered sir, it occurs to me: ‘Indeed our Lord is a remover of many painful things, indeed our Lord is a bringer of many pleasant things, indeed our Lord is a remover of many unskilled things, indeed our Lord is a bringer of many skilled things.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>“But even so, Udāyin, some foolish persons here, on being told by me: ‘Give this up,’ speak thus: ‘But what of this trifling insignificant matter? This recluse lays too much emphasis on (exertion).’ But they do not give it up and they cause dissatisfaction to be nursed against me and against those monks who desire the training. This becomes for them, Udāyin, a strong bond, a stout bond, a solid bond, a bond that does not rot away, a thick log of wood.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Udāyin, as a quail, a little hen bird, because she is caught in a trap of creepers, comes to slaughter there, or to captivity or dying; so that, Udāyin, if any one should say: ‘That quail, a little hen bird, because she is caught in a trap of creepers, comes to slaughter there, or to captivity, or dying, yet for her it is a bond of no strength, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en122' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Udāyin, as a quail, a little hen bird, because she is caught in a trap of creepers, comes to slaughter there, or to captivity or dying; so that, Udāyin, if any one should say: ‘That quail, a little hen bird, because she is caught in a trap of creepers, comes to slaughter there, or to captivity, or dying, yet for her it is a bond of no strength, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en122'>PTS vp En 122</a> a weak bond, a bond that rots away, a pithless bond’—would anyone speaking thus, Udāyin, be speaking rightly?” “No, revered sir. That quail, a little hen bird, revered sir, because she is caught in a trap of creepers, comes to slaughter there, or to captivity, or dying, since for her it is a strong bond, a stout bond, a solid bond, a bond that does not rot away, a thick log of wood.”</p>

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd25' href='#dd25'>Dhdas-bh 25</a>There are these five strands of sense-pleasures, Udāyin. What five? What are the five? Material shapes cognisable by the eye, agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring. Sounds cognisable by the ear, agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring. Smells cognisable by the nose, agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring. Tastes cognisable by the tongue, agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring. Touches cognisable by the body, agreeable, pleasant, liked, enticing, connected with sensual pleasures, alluring. These, Udāyin, are the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd26' href='#dd26'>Dhdas-bh 26</a>Whatever happiness, whatever joy, Udāyin, arises in consequence of these five strands of sense-pleasures, it is called a happiness of sense-pleasures that is a vile happiness, the happiness of an average person, an unariyan happiness. It should not be pursued, developed or made much of. I say of this happiness, that it is to be feared.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd27' href='#dd27'>Dhdas-bh 27</a>In this connection, Udāyin, a monk, aloof from the pleasures of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, enters and abides in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness, and is rapturous and joyful.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd28' href='#dd28'>Dhdas-bh 28</a>And again, monks, a monk, by allaying initial and discursive thought, his mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point, enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought, is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd29' href='#dd29'>Dhdas-bh 29</a>And again, monks, a monk, by the fading out of rapture, dwells with equanimity, attentive and clearly conscious, and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say: ‘Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,’ and he enters on and abides in the third meditation.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd30' href='#dd30'>Dhdas-bh 30</a>And again, monks, a monk by getting rid of joy, by getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows, enters on and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy, and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
