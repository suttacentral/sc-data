<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> at one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. At that time a monk named Gulissāni, forest-gone, uncouth in his habits, had arrived in the midst of an Order on some business or other. Thereupon the venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks concerning the monk Gulissāni, saying:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>“Your reverences, a monk who is forest-gone and who comes back to an Order and is staying with an Order, should be deferential and respectful towards his fellow Brahma-farers. If, your reverences, a monk who is forest-gone, comes back to an Order and is staying with an Order and is not deferential and respectful towards his fellow Brahma-farers, there will be those who speak about him and say: ‘What is the good of this venerable one who is forest-gone and who lives alone in the forest, doing as he pleases, but who is not deferential and respectful towards his fellow Brahma-farers? There will be those who speak about him.’ Therefore a monk who is forest-gone and who has come back to an Order and is staying with <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en142' href='#pts-vp-en142'>PTS vp En 142</a> an Order should be deferential and respectful towards his fellow Brahma-farers.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Your reverences, a monk who is forest-gone and who comes back to an Order and is staying with an Order, should be skilled about the seats, thinking: ‘I will sit down not encroaching on (the space intended for) monks who are elders, nor will I keep newly ordained monks from a seat.’ If, your reverences, a monk who is forest-gone comes back to an Order and is staying with an Order, and is not skilled about the seats, there will be those who speak about him and say: ‘What is the good of this venerable one who is forest-gone and who lives alone in the forest doing what he pleases, but who does not even know the rule about decent conduct? There will be those who speak about him.’ Therefore a monk who is forest-gone and who has come back to an Order and is staying with an Order should be skilled about the seats.</p>
