<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> at one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. While he was <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en108' href='#pts-vp-en108'>PTS vp En 108</a> there the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Monks.” “Revered One,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>“I, monks, partake of my food at one session. Partaking of my food at one session, I, monks, am aware of good health and of being without illness and of buoyancy and strength and living in comfort. Come, do you too, monks, partake of your food at one session. Partaking of your food at one session, you too, monks, will be aware of good health, of being without illness, of bouyancy and strength and living in comfort.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>When this had been said, the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord: “I, revered sir, am not capable of eating my food at one session; revered sir, if I ate my food at one session, I might have scruples, I might have misgivings.” “Well then, you, Bhaddāli, having eaten one portion there where you were invited, having taken another portion away, might eat that too; so could you, Bhaddāli, eating thus, keep yourself going.” “I, revered sir, am not capable of eating in this fashion; even eating so, revered sir, I might have scruples, I might have misgivings.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then the venerable Bhaddāli, while a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord, while the Order of monks was undertaking the training, made known his inability. Then the venerable Bhaddāli did not see the Lord face to face for an entire three months because he was one who did not carry out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Now at that time a number of monks were making up robe-material for the Lord, and they said: “When the Lord's robe-material is settled, he will set out on a three months tour.” Then the venerable Bhaddāli approached these monks; having approached, he exchanged greetings with these monks; having conversed in a <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en109' href='#pts-vp-en109'>PTS vp En 109</a> friendly and courteous way, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>These monks spoke thus to the venerable Bhaddāli as he was sitting down at a respectful distance: “Reverend Bhaddāli, this robe-material is being made up for the Lord. When the robe-material is settled, the Lord will set out on a three months tour. Please, reverend Bhaddāli, pay careful attention to this opportunity, lest later it is more difficult for you.” “Yes, your reverences,” and the venerable Bhaddāli, having answered these monks in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me, foolish, misguided and wrong that I was, inasmuch as I made known an inability when a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training. Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression as a transgression for the sake of restraint in the future,” “Indeed, Bhaddāli, a transgression overcame you, foolish, misguided and wrong that you were, inasmuch as while a rule of training was being laid down by me and while the training was being undertaken by the Order of monks, you made known your inability.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>At that time this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli: ‘The Lord is staying near Sāvatthī and the Lord will know of me that the monk named Bhaddāli is not one that carries out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction’. At that time this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli. Nor at that time was this realised by you, Bhaddāli: ‘A number of monks who have come to Sāvatthī for the rains will also know of me that the monk named Bhaddāli is not one that carries out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction’. At that time this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli. Nor at that time was this realised by you, Bhaddāli: ‘A number of nuns who have come to Sāvatthī for the rains will also know of me that the monk named Bhaddāli is not one that carries out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction’. At that time this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli. Nor at that time was this realised by you, Bhaddāli: ‘A number of lay-followers who are living in Sāvatthī will also know of me that the monk named Bhaddāli is not one that carries out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction’. At that time this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli. Nor at that time was this realised by you, Bhaddāli: ‘A number of women lay-followers who are living in Sāvatthī will also know of me that the monk named Bhaddāli is not one that carries out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction. At that time this was not realised by you, Bhaddāli. Nor at that time was this realised by you, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en110' href='#pts-vp-en110'>PTS vp En 110</a> Bhaddāli: ‘A number of recluses and brahmans belonging to other sects who have come to Sāvatthī for the rains will also know of me that the monk named Bhaddāli is not one that carries out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction’. At that time this was not realised by you either Bhaddāli.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>“Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me, foolish, misguided and wrong that I was, inasmuch as I made known an inability when a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training. Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression as a transgression for the sake of restraint in the future,” “Indeed, Bhaddāli, a transgression overcame you, foolish, misguided and wrong that you were, inasmuch as while a rule of training was being laid down by me and while the training was being undertaken by the Order of monks, you made known your inability.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? There might be a monk here, freed both ways to whom I might speak thus: ‘Come you, monk, be a causeway for me across the mire.’ Would he make a causeway of himself, or would he twist his body in another (direction), or would he say ‘No’?” “Not this, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>“What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? There might be a monk here, freed through intuitive wisdom to whom I might speak thus: ‘Come you, monk, be a causeway for me across the mire.’ Would he make a causeway of himself or would he twist his body in another (direction), or would he say ‘No’?” “Not this, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>“What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? There might be a monk here, a mental realiser to whom I might speak thus: ‘Come you, monk, be a causeway for me across the mire.’ Would he make a causeway of himself or would he twist his body in another (direction), or would he say ‘No’?” “Not this, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>“What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? There might be a monk here, won to view, to whom I might speak thus: ‘Come you, monk, be a causeway for me across the mire.’ Would he make a causeway of himself, or would he twist his body in another (direction), or would he say ‘No’?” “Not this, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>“What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? There might be a monk here, freed through faith to whom I might speak thus: ‘Come you, monk, be a causeway for me across the mire.’ Would he make a causeway of himself or would he twist his body in another (direction), or would he say ‘No’?” “Not this, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>“What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? There might be a monk here, who strives after Dhamma to whom I might speak thus: ‘Come you, monk, be a causeway for me across the mire.’ Would he make a causeway of himself or would he twist his body in another (direction), or would he say ‘No’?” “Not this, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>“What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? There might be a monk here, who strives after faith, to whom I might speak thus: ‘Come you, monk, be a causeway for me across the mire.’ Would he make a causeway of himself or would he twist his body in another (direction), or would he say ‘No’?” “Not this, revered sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd17' href='#dd17'>Dhdas-bh 17</a>“What do you think about this, Bhaddāli? At that time were <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en111' href='#pts-vp-en111'>PTS vp En 111</a> you, Bhaddāli, freed both ways, or freed through intuitive wisdom or a mental realiser, or one that had won to view, or one freed through faith, or one striving after Dhamma, or one striving after faith?” “Not this, revered sir.” “At that time were not you, Bhaddāli, empty, void, fallen short?” “Yes, revered sir.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd18' href='#dd18'>Dhdas-bh 18</a>“Revered sir, a transgression has overcome me, foolish, misguided and wrong that I was, inasmuch as I made known an inability when a rule of training was being laid down by the Lord and when the Order of monks was undertaking the training. Revered sir, may the Lord acknowledge the transgression as a transgression for the sake of restraint in the future,” “Indeed, Bhaddāli, a transgression overcame you, foolish, misguided and wrong that you were, inasmuch as while a rule of training was being laid down by me and while the training was being undertaken by the Order of monks, you made known your inability. But since you, Bhaddāli, see the transgression as a transgression and confess it according to the rule, we acknowledge it for you. For, Bhaddāli, in the discipline for an ariyan, this is growth: whoever, seeing a transgression as a transgression, confesses according to the rule, he comes to restraint in the future.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd19' href='#dd19'>Dhdas-bh 19</a>Herein, Bhaddāli, some monk is not one that carries out in full the Teacher's instruction. It occurs to him: ‘Suppose I were to resort to a remote lodging—to a forest, to the root of a tree, a mountain slope, a wild place, a hill cave, a cemetery, a woodland thicket, the open air, a heap of straw—I should probably realise conditions of further-men, the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd20' href='#dd20'>Dhdas-bh 20</a>So he resorts to a remote lodging—to a forest, to the root of a tree, a mountain slope, a wild place, a hill cave, a cemetery, a woodland thicket, the open air, a heap of straw. As he is staying aloof in this way the Teacher upbraids him and when they have examined him his learned fellow Brahma-farers upbraid him and devatās upbraid him and the self upbraids the self. He, upbraided by the Teacher and upbraided by his learned fellow Brahma-farers after they have examined him and upbraided by devatās and the self upbraided by the self, does not realise conditions of further-men, the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd21' href='#dd21'>Dhdas-bh 21</a>What is <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en112' href='#pts-vp-en112'>PTS vp En 112</a> the reason for this? It is thus, Bhaddāli, since he is not one that carries out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction. But, Bhaddāli, there is some monk here who fully carries out the training under the Teacher's instruction. It occurs to him: ‘If I were to resort to a remote lodging—to a forest, to the root of a tree, a mountain slope, a wild place, a hill cave, a cemetery, a woodland thicket, the open air, a heap of straw, I should probably realise conditions of further-men, the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.’ So he resorts to a remote lodging—to a forest, to the root of a tree, a mountain slope, a wild place, a hill cave, a cemetery, a woodland thicket, the open air, a heap of straw.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd22' href='#dd22'>Dhdas-bh 22</a>As he is staying aloof in this way neither the Teacher upbraids him, nor, after they have examined him, do his learned fellow Brahma-farers upbraid him, nor do devatās upbraid him, nor does the self upbraid the self. He, neither upbraided by the Teacher, nor upbraided by his learned fellow Brahma-farers after they have examined him, nor upbraided by devatās, nor the self upbraided by the self, realises conditions of further-men, the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd23' href='#dd23'>Dhdas-bh 23</a>He, aloof from pleasures of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, enters and abides in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness and is rapturous and joyful. What is the reason for this? It is thus, Bhaddāli, for one who fully carries out the training under the Teacher's instruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd24' href='#dd24'>Dhdas-bh 24</a>And again, monks, a monk, by allaying initial and discursive thought, his mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point, enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought, is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful. What is the reason for this? It is thus, Bhaddāli, for one who fully carries out the training under the Teacher's instruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd25' href='#dd25'>Dhdas-bh 25</a>And again, monks, a monk, by the fading out of rapture, dwells with equanimity, attentive and clearly conscious, and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say: ‘Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,’ and he enters on and abides in the third meditation. What is the reason for this? It is thus, Bhaddāli, for one who fully carries out the training under the Teacher's instruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd26' href='#dd26'>Dhdas-bh 26</a>And again, monks, a monk by getting rid of joy, by getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows, enters on and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en113' href='#pts-vp-en113'>PTS vp En 113</a> nor joy, and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness. What is the reason for this? It is thus, Bhaddāli, for one who fully carries out the training under the Teacher's instruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd27' href='#dd27'>Dhdas-bh 27</a>Thus with the mind thus composed, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, stable, immovable, he directs his mind to the knowledge and recollection of former habitations. He recollects a variety of former habitations, thus: one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births and many an eon of integration and many an eon of disintegration and many an eon of integration-disintegration: ‘Such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so I was nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I came to be in another state, where I was such a one by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so I was nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I arose here.’ Thus he recollects divers former habitations in all their modes and detail.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd28' href='#dd28'>Dhdas-bh 28</a>With the mind composed thus, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, stable, immovable, he directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing hence and the arising of beings. With the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, he sees beings as they pass hence or come to be; he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going, according to the consequences of deeds, and thinks: ‘Indeed these worthy beings, who were possessed of wrong conduct in body, speech and thought, scoffers at the ariyans, holding a wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view—these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body, speech and thought, who did not scoff at the ariyans, holding a right view, incurring deeds consequent on a right view—these at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world.’ Thus with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men does he see beings as they pass hence, as they arise; he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going according to the consequences of deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd29' href='#dd29'>Dhdas-bh 29</a>With the mind composed thus, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, stable, immovable, he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers. He comprehends as it really is: ‘This is anguish’, ‘this is the arising of anguish’, ‘this is the stopping of anguish’, ‘this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish’. He comprehends as it really is: ‘These are the cankers’, ‘this is the arising of the cankers’, ‘this is the stopping of the cankers’, ‘this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers’.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd30' href='#dd30'>Dhdas-bh 30</a>Knowing thus, seeing thus, his mind is freed from the canker of sense-pleasures and his mind is freed from the canker of becoming and his mind is freed from the canker of ignorance. In freedom the knowledge comes to be: ‘I am freed’; and he comprehends: ‘Destroyed is birth, brought to a close the Brahma-faring, done is what was to be done, there is no more of being such or so.’ What is the reason for this? It is thus, Bhaddāli, for one who fully carries out the training under the Teacher's instruction.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd31' href='#dd31'>Dhdas-bh 31</a>When this had been said, the venerable Bhaddāli spoke thus to the Lord: “What is the cause, revered sir, what the reason why they constantly take action against some monk here? What is the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en114' href='#pts-vp-en114'>PTS vp En 114</a> cause, revered sir, what the reason why they do not constantly take similar action against some other monk here?” “As to this, Bhaddāli, some monk is a constant offender, full of offences. On being spoken to by the monks he shelves the question by asking another, he answers off the point, he evinces anger and ill-will and discontent, he does not conduct himself properly, is not subdued, does not mend his ways, and does not say: ‘What can I do to please the Order?’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd32' href='#dd32'>Dhdas-bh 32</a>Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks: ‘This monk, your reverences, is a constant offender, full of offences. On being spoken to by the monks he shelves the question by asking another, he answers off the point, he evinces anger and ill-will and discontent, he does not conduct himself properly, is not subdued, does not mend his ways, and does not say: ‘What can I do to please the Order?’ It were good if the venerable ones were to investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his should not be settled quickly.’ So, Bhaddāli, the monks investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his is not settled quickly. But, Bhaddāli, some monk is a constant offender, full of offences. He, on being spoken to by the monks does not shelve the question by asking another, he does not answer off the point, he does not evince anger and ill-will and discontent, he conducts himself properly, is subdued, mends his ways, and he says: ‘What can I do to please the Order?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd33' href='#dd33'>Dhdas-bh 33</a>Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks: ‘This monk, your reverences, is a constant offender, full of offences. He, on being spoken to by the monks does not shelve the question by asking another, he does not answer off the point, he does not evince anger and ill-will and discontent, he conducts himself properly, is subdued, mends his ways, and he says: ‘What can I do to please the Order? It were good if the venerable ones were to investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his should be settled quickly.’ So, Bhaddāli, the monte investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his is settled quickly.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd34' href='#dd34'>Dhdas-bh 34</a>Then, Bhaddāli, some monk here is an occasional offender, he is not full of offences. But he, on being spoken to by the monks shelves the question by asking another, he answers off the point, he evinces anger and ill-will and discontent, he does not conduct himself properly, is not subdued, does not mend his ways, and does not say: ‘What can I do to please the Order?’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd35' href='#dd35'>Dhdas-bh 35</a>Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks: This monk, your reverences, is an occasional offender, he is not full of offences. But he, on being spoken to by the monks shelves the question by asking another, he answers off the point, he evinces anger and ill-will and discontent, he does not conduct himself properly, is not subdued, does not mend his ways, and does not say: ‘What can <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en115' href='#pts-vp-en115'>PTS vp En 115</a> I do to please the Order?’ It were good if the venerable ones were to investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his should not be settled quickly.’ So, Bhaddāli, the monks investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his is not settled quickly. But, Bhaddāli, some monk is an occasional offender, he is not full of offences. He, on being spoken to by the monks does not shelve the question by asking another, he does not answer off the point, he does not evince anger and ill-will and discontent, he conducts himself properly, is subdued, mends his ways, and he says: ‘What can I do to please the Order?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd36' href='#dd36'>Dhdas-bh 36</a>Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks: This monk, your reverences, is an occasional offender, he is not full of offences. He, on being spoken to by the monks does not shelve the question by asking another, he does not answer off the point, he does not evince anger and ill-will and discontent, he conducts himself properly, is subdued, mends his ways, and he says: ‘What can I do to please the Order? It were good if the venerable ones were to investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his should be settled quickly.’ So, Bhaddāli, the monte investigate this monk in such a way that this legal question of his is settled quickly.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd37' href='#dd37'>Dhdas-bh 37</a>In this connection, Bhaddāli, some monk is going along with only a little faith, with only a little regard. Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks: ‘This reverend monk is going along with only a little faith, only a little regard. If we constantly take action against this monk, be careful lest even that little faith of his, even that little regard, deteriorate.’ Bhaddāli, it is like a man with only one eye—his friends and acquaintances, his kith and kin would take care of that one eye so that that one eye of his did not deteriorate, thinking: ‘Take care lest that one eye of his deteriorates.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd38' href='#dd38'>Dhdas-bh 38</a>Even so, Bhaddāli, some monk goes along with only a little faith, only a little regard. Therefore, Bhaddāli, it occurs to the monks: ‘This reverend monk is going along with only a little faith, only a little regard. If we constantly take action against this monk, be careful lest even that little faith of his, even that little regard, deteriorate.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd39' href='#dd39'>Dhdas-bh 39</a>This, Bhaddāli, is the cause, this the reason why they constantly take action against some monk here. But, Bhaddāli, this is the cause, this the reason why they do not constantly take similar action against some (other) monk here.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd40' href='#dd40'>Dhdas-bh 40</a>“What is the cause, revered sir, what the reason why there were formerly fewer rules of training, but more monks who were established in profound knowledge? And what is the cause, revered sir, what the reason why there are now more rules of training, but fewer monks who are established in profound knowledge?” <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en116' href='#pts-vp-en116'>PTS vp En 116</a> “It is thus, Bhaddāli: when beings are deteriorating, when true Dhamma is vanishing away, there are more rules of training and fewer monks established in profound knowledge. Not until some conditions, which cause cankers appear here in the Order does the Teacher, Bhaddāli, lay down a rule of training for disciples. But when, Bhaddāli, some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order, then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples, so as to ward off those very conditions which cause cankers.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd41' href='#dd41'>Dhdas-bh 41</a>Not until the Order has arrived at greatness, Bhaddāli, do some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order. But when, Bhaddāli, the Order has arrived at greatness, then some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order, and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples so as to ward off those very conditions which cause cankers.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd42' href='#dd42'>Dhdas-bh 42</a>Not until the Order has arrived at the height of gain, Bhaddāli, do some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order. But when, Bhaddāli, the Order has arrived at the height of gain, then some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order, and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples so as to ward off those very conditions which cause cankers.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd43' href='#dd43'>Dhdas-bh 43</a>Not until the Order has arrived at the height of fame, Bhaddāli, do some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order. But when, Bhaddāli, the Order has arrived at the height of fame, then some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples so as to ward off those very conditions which cause cankers.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd44' href='#dd44'>Dhdas-bh 44</a>Not until the Order has arrived at much learning, Bhaddāli, do some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order. But when, Bhaddāli, the Order has arrived at much learning, then some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples so as to ward off those very conditions which cause cankers.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd45' href='#dd45'>Dhdas-bh 45</a>Not until the Order has arrived at long standing, Bhaddāli, do some conditions which <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en117' href='#pts-vp-en117'>PTS vp En 117</a> cause cankers appear here in the Order. But when, Bhaddāli, the Order has arrived at long standing, then some conditions which cause cankers appear here in the Order and then the Teacher lays down a rule of training for disciples so as to ward off those very conditions which cause cankers.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd46' href='#dd46'>Dhdas-bh 46</a>You were few at the time when I, Bhaddāli, taught you the disquisition on Dhamma—the Parable of the Thoroughbred Colt. Do you, Bhaddāli, remember?” “No, revered sir.” “To what cause do you attribute this, Bhaddāli?” “It is that I, revered sir, for a long time was not one who carried out in full the training under the Teacher's instruction.” “This was not the only cause or reason, Bhaddāli. For, for a long time, Bhaddāli, I have known your mind with my mind (and I knew): ‘While Dhamma is being taught by me, this foolish man does not listen to Dhamma with ready ear, applying himself, paying attention, concentrating with all his mind. However, I, Bhaddāli, will teach you the disquisition on Dhamma—the Parable of the Thoroughbred Colt. Listen to it, attend carefully, and I will speak.” “Yes, revered sir,” the venerable Bhaddāli answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd47' href='#dd47'>Dhdas-bh 47</a>The Lord spoke thus: “Bhaddāli, as a skilled horse-trainer, having received a beautiful thoroughbred, first of all makes it get used to the training in respect of wearing the bit; while it is getting used to the training in respect of wearing the bit, whatever the contortions, capers, struggles, while it is getting used to a training it was not used to before, yet because of the continual training, the gradual training, it is brought to perfection in that respect.</p>

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd60' href='#dd60'>Dhdas-bh 60</a>Even so, Bhaddāli, if a monk is endowed with ten qualities, he is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, to be saluted with joined palms, an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.
