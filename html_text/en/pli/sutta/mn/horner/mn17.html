Monks, this monk should reflect thus: ‘I am staying near this man. While I am staying near this man, mindfulness that had not been aroused is not aroused, and thought which was not composed is not composed, and the cankers which were not totally destroyed do not come to total destruction, and the incomparable security from the bonds which had not been attained is not attained, but those necessities of life which should be procured by one who has gone forth, robe-material, almsfood, lodgings, medicines for the sick, these are to be got with (only) a little difficulty. But I did not go forth from home into homelessness for the sake of robe-material. I did not go forth from home into homelessness for the sake of almsfood. I did not go forth from home into homelessness for the sake of lodgings. I did not go forth from home into homelessness for the sake of medicines for the sick. But while I am staying near this man, mindfulness which had not been aroused is not aroused, and thought which was not composed is not composed, and the cankers which were not totally destroyed do not come to total destruction, and the incomparable security from the bonds which had not been attained is not attained.’ Monks, that monk, whether it be by night or day, should depart without having asked that man (for permission), he should not be waited on by him.</p>
