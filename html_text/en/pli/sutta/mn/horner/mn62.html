<h1>62. Greater Discourse on an Exhortation to Rahula</h1>
</header>
<h2><a class='bd' id='bd1'></a><span class='add'>Setting</span></h2>
<p><a class='wp' id='wp1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> at one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for almsfood. The venerable Rāhula, <a class='bjt' id='bjt1.421'></a>having also dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe followed close after the Lord.</p>
<h2><a class='bd' id='bd2'></a><span class='add'>Contemplating the Five Aggregates - Insight</span></h2>
<p>Then the Lord, having looked round, addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying: “Whatever, Rāhula, is material shape, past, future, present, subjective or objective, gross or subtle, low or excellent, distant or near, all material shape should be seen as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this am I not, this is not my self.’” “Only material shape, Lord, only material shape, Wellfarer?” “Material shape, Rāhula, and feeling, Rāhula, and perception, Rāhula, and the habitual tendencies, Rāhula, and consciousness, Rāhula.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd3'></a>Then the venerable Rāhula thought: “Who indeed today, when he has been exhorted with an exhortation face-to-face with the Lord, could enter a village for almsfood?” And turning back from there, he sat down cross-legged at the root of a tree, holding his back erect and arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>
<h2><a class='bd' id='bd4'></a><span class='add'>Sāriputta Teaching Rāhula</span></h2>
<p>Then the venerable Sāriputta saw the venerable Rāhula sitting down cross-legged at the root of the tree, holding his back erect and arousing mindfulness in front of him; and seeing him, he addressed the venerable Rāhula, saying: “Develop the (mind-) development that is mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula. Mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula, if developed and made much of is of great fruit, of great advantage.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd5'></a>Then the venerable <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en92'></a>Rāhula, emerging from solitary meditation towards evening, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Rāhula spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, how if mindfulness on in-breathing and out-breathing is developed and made much of is it of great fruit, of great advantage?”</p>

<h3><span class='add'>Contemplating the Elements</span></h3>
<h4><span class='add'>Recognising the Solid/Extension Element - Calm</span></h4>
<p>“Whatever, Rāhula, is hard, solid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom, that is to say: the hair of the head, the hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow of the bones, kidney, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement, or whatever other thing is hard, solid, is internal, referable to an individual and derived therefrom, this, Rāhula, is called the internal element of extension. Whatever is an internal element of extension and whatever is an external element of extension, just these are the element of extension.</p>
<h4><a class='bd' id='bd7'></a><span class='add'>Contemplating the Solid/Extension Element - Insight</span></h4>
<p>By means of perfect intuitive wisdom it should be seen of this as it really is, thus: This is not mine, this am I not, this is not my self.<a class='bjt' id='bjt1.422'></a> Having seen it thus as it really is by means of perfect intuitive wisdom, he disregards the element of extension, he cleanses his thought of the element of extension.</p>

<h4><a class='bd' id='bd12'></a><span class='add'>Recognising the Motion Element - Calm</span></h4>

<h4><a class='bd' id='bd15'></a><span class='add'>Contemplating the Space Element - Insight</span></h4>

<h4><a class='bd' id='bd16'></a><span class='add'>Similes of Elements and Mental Development</span></h4>
<p>Develop the (mind-) development that is like the earth, Rāhula. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like the earth, Rāhula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist. As, Rāhula, people cast what is clean on to the earth and what is unclean and, ordure and urine and spittle and pus and blood, and yet the earth is not troubled thereby nor worried or disgusted, even so do you, Rāhula, develop the (mind-) development that is like the earth. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like the earth, Rāhula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd17'></a>Develop the (mind-) development that is like water, Rāhula. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like water, Rāhula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist. As, Rāhula, people wash what is clean in water and what is unclean and wash away ordure and urine and spittle and pus and blood, and yet the water is not troubled thereby nor worried or disgusted, <a class='bjt' id='bjt1.424'></a>even so do you, Rāhula, develop the (mind-) development that is like water. For, from developing … will not persist.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd18'></a>Develop the (mind-) development that is like fire, Rāhula. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like fire, Rāhula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist. As, Rāhula, fire burns what is clean and what is unclean and ordure and urine and spittle and pus and blood, and yet the fire is not troubled thereby nor <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en95'></a>worried or disgusted, even so do you, Rāhula, develop the (mind-) development that is like fire. For, from developing … will not persist.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd19'></a>Develop the (mind-) development that is like wind, Rāhula. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like wind, Rāhula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist. As, Rāhula, the wind blows upon what is clean and what is unclean and upon ordure and urine and spittle and pus and blood, and yet the wind is not troubled thereby nor worried or disgusted, even so do you, Rāhula, develop the (mind-) development that is like wind. For from developing … will not persist.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd20'></a>Develop the (mind-) development that is like air, Rāhula. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like air, Rāhula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist. As, Rāhula, the air does not repose anywhere, even so do you, Rāhula, develop the (mind-) development that is like air. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is like air, Rāhula, agreeable and disagreeable sensory impressions that have arisen, taking hold of your thought, will not persist.</p>
<h3><a class='bd' id='bd21'></a><span class='add'>Developing the Divine Abodes</span></h3>
<p>Develop the (mind-) development that is friendliness, Rāhula. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is friendliness, Rāhula, that which is malevolence will be got rid of.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd22'></a>Develop the (mind-) development that is compassion, Rāhula. For, from developing the (mind-) development that is compassion, Rāhula, that which is harming will be got rid of.</p>

<h3><a class='bd' id='bd26'></a><span class='add'>Developing Perception of Impermanence</span></h3>
<p>Develop the (mind-) development that is perception of impermanence, Rāhula. <a class='bjt' id='bjt1.425'></a>For, from developing the (mind-) development that is perception of impermanence, Rāhula, that which is the conceit, ‘I am’ will be got rid of.</p>
<h3><a class='bd' id='bd27'></a><span class='add'>Developing Mindfulness of Breathing</span></h3>
<p>Develop the (mind-) development that is mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula. Mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing, Rāhula, is of great fruit, of great advantage. And how, Rāhula, if mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing is developed, how, if it is made much of, is it of great fruit, of great advantage? As to this, Rāhula, a monk who is-forest-gone or gone to the root of a tree or gone to an empty place, sits down cross-legged, holding his back erect, arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>
<h4><a class='bd' id='bd28'></a><span class='add'>First Tetrad - Recognising Body - Calm</span></h4>
<p><span class='add'>[1]</span> Mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. <span class='add'>[2]</span> Breathing in a long (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing in a long (breath)’; or breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing out a long (breath)’; or breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing in a short (breath)’; or breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing out a short (breath).’ <span class='add'>[3]</span> He trains himself thinking: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body’; he trains himself thinking: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ <span class='add'>[4]</span> He trains himself thinking: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the activity of the body’; he trains himself thinking: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the activity of the body.’</p>
<h4><a class='bd' id='bd29'></a><span class='add'>Second Tetrad - Recognising Sensations - Calm</span></h4>
<p>He trains himself thinking: ‘I shall breathe in … out: <span class='add'>[5]</span> … experiencing rapture’; <span class='add'>[6]</span> … experiencing happiness’; <span class='add'>[7]</span> … experiencing the activity of thought’; <span class='add'>[8]</span> … tranquillising the activity of thought.’</p>
<h4><a class='bd' id='bd30'></a><span class='add'>Third Tetrad - Recognising Thought - Calm</span></h4>
<p>He trains himself thinking: ‘I shall breathe in … out: <span class='add'>[9]</span> … experiencing thought’; <span class='add'>[10]</span> … rejoicing in thought’; <span class='add'>[11]</span> … concentrating thought’; <span class='add'>[12]</span> … freeing thought.’</p>
<h4><a class='bd' id='bd31'></a><span class='add'>Fourth Tetrad - Contemplating Dhamma - Insight</span></h4>
<p>He trains himself thinking: ‘I shall breathe in … out: <span class='add'>[13]</span> … beholding impermanence’; <span class='add'>[14]</span> … beholding dispassion’; <span class='add'>[15]</span> … beholding stopping’; <span class='add'>[16]</span> … beholding casting away.’</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd32'></a><a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en97'></a>Mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing if developed thus, Rāhula, if made much of thus, is of great fruit, of great advantage. When, Rāhula, mindfulness of in-breathing and out-breathing has been developed thus, <a class='bjt' id='bjt1.426'></a>has been made much of thus, then those which are the last in-breaths and out-breaths are also stopped only when they are known, not when they are unknown.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, the venerable Rāhula rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
