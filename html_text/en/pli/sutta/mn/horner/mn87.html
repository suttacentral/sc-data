<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time the dear and beloved little only son of a certain householder had passed away. After he had passed away, he (the father) had no inclination for work or for food. Going constantly to the cemetery, he wailed: “Where are you, little only son? Where are you, little only son?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Then that householder approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. The Lord spoke thus to that householder as he was sitting down at a respectful distance: “Have not you, householder, controlling faculties for stilling your own mind? There is a change in your faculties.” “But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord? For, Lord, my dear and beloved little only son has passed away. Since he passed away I have no inclination for work or food. Going constantly to the cemetery, I wail: ‘Where are you, little only son? Where are you, little only son?’” “That is just it, householder. For, householder, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection.” “But for whom, Lord, could this hold good in this way: ‘Grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection?’ For, Lord, bliss and happiness are born of affection, originate in affection.” <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en293' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Then that householder approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. The Lord spoke thus to that householder as he was sitting down at a respectful distance: “Have not you, householder, controlling faculties for stilling your own mind? There is a change in your faculties.” “But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord? For, Lord, my dear and beloved little only son has passed away. Since he passed away I have no inclination for work or food. Going constantly to the cemetery, I wail: ‘Where are you, little only son? Where are you, little only son?’” “That is just it, householder. For, householder, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection.” “But for whom, Lord, could this hold good in this way: ‘Grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection?’ For, Lord, bliss and happiness are born of affection, originate in affection.” <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en293'>PTS vp En 293</a> Then the householder, not rejoicing in what the Lord had said, repudiating it, rising from his seat, departed.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Now at that time a number of gamblers were playing dice not far from the Lord. Then that householder approached these gamblers; having approached, he spoke thus to these gamblers: “Now, I, sirs, approached the recluse Gotama; having approached, having greeted the recluse Gotama, I sat down at a respectful distance. Then, sirs, the recluse Gotama spoke thus to me as I was sitting down at a respectful distance: ‘Have not you, householder, controlling faculties for stilling your own mind? There is a change in your faculties.’ ‘But how could there be no change in my faculties, Lord? For, Lord, my dear and beloved little only son has passed away. Since he passed away I have no inclination for work or food. Going constantly to the cemetery, I wail: “Where are you, little only son? Where are you, little only son?”’ ‘That is just it, householder. For, householder, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection.’ ‘But for whom, Lord, could this hold good in this way: “Grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection?” For, Lord, bliss and happiness are born of affection, originate in affection.’ Then I, sirs, not rejoicing in what the Lord had said, repudiating it, rising from my seat, departed.” “That is just it, householder, that is just it, householder; for, householder, bliss and happiness are born of affection, originate in affection.” Then the householder, thinking: “There is agreement between me and the gamblers,” departed.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then this subject of conversation gradually penetrated the royal palace. And King Pasenadi of Kosala spoke thus to Queen Mallikā: “This was said to these, Mallikā, by the recluse Gotama: ‘Grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection.’” “If this, sire, was said by the Lord, it is so.” “As the recluse Gotama speaks so does Mallikā because she is much delighted with him: ‘If this, sire, was said by the Lord, it is so.’ It is just as when a teacher speaks to his pupil and the pupil is so much delighted with him that he says ‘It is just so, teacher, it is just so, teacher.’ Even so do you, Mallikā, because you are so much delighted with what the recluse Gotama says, say: ‘If this, sire, was said by the Lord, it is so.’ Be off, Mallikā, go away.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Then Queen Mallikā summoned the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha, and said: “Come you, brahman, approach the Lord; having approached, in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort; and say: ‘Lord, Queen Mallikā salutes the Lord's feet with her head, and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort.’ and then say: ‘Revered sir, were these words spoken by the Lord: ‘Grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection?’ And when you have mastered well what the Lord <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en294' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Then Queen Mallikā summoned the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha, and said: “Come you, brahman, approach the Lord; having approached, in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort; and say: ‘Lord, Queen Mallikā salutes the Lord's feet with her head, and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort.’ and then say: ‘Revered sir, were these words spoken by the Lord: ‘Grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection?’ And when you have mastered well what the Lord <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en294'>PTS vp En 294</a> explains to you, you must tell me. For Tathāgatas do not speak against the truth.” “Yes, madam,” and the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha, having answered Queen Mallikā in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord; having conversed in a courteous and friendly way, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha, spoke thus to the Lord; “Good Gotama, Queen Mallikā with her head salutes the good Gotama' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the brahman Nāḷijaṅgha, spoke thus to the Lord; “Good Gotama, Queen Mallikā with her head salutes the good Gotama's feet and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort. And she speaks thus: ‘Revered sir, were these words spoken by the Lord: ‘Grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection?’ “It is just so, brahman, it is just so, brahman. For, brahman, grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair are born of affection, originate in affection.</p>

My daughter Vajīrī is dear to me.” “What do you think about this, sire? From an alteration and otherness in your daughter Vajīrī would there arise in you grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair?” “From an alteration and otherness, Mallikā, in my daughter Vajīrī there would be a change for me, even for life.

Elsewhere the Buddha sets the example of only honouring Dhamma.</span> It is wonderful, Mallikā, it is marvellous, Mallikā, how much the Lord, penetrating through wisdom, sees by means of wisdom. Come, Mallikā, let me wash (ceremonially).” Then King Pasenadi, rising from his seat, having arranged his upper garment over one shoulder, having saluted the Lord with joined palms, three times uttered this solemn utterance: “Praise to the Lord, the perfected one, the fully Self-Awakened One. “Praise to the Lord, the perfected one, the fully Self-Awakened One. “Praise to the Lord, the perfected one, the fully Self-Awakened One.”</p>
