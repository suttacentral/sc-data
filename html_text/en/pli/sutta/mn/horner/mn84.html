He went by vehicle as long as the ground was passable, then, having dismounted from the vehicle, he approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great on foot; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Kaccāna the Great; and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>

It is as if one might set upright what had been upset, or might disclose what was covered, or show the way to one who had gone astray, or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness so that those with vision might see material shapes, even so in many a figure has Dhamma been made clear by the good Kaccāna. Thus I am going to the revered Kaccāna for refuge and to Dhamma and to the Order of monks.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd30' href='#dd30'>Dhdas-bh 30</a>“But do not you, sire, go for refuge to me.

And, good Kaccāna, even if we heard that the Lord were a hundred yojana distant, we should go the hundred yojana so as to see that Lord, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One. But, good Kaccāna, since the Lord has attained final nibbāna, we are going for refuge to that Lord who has attained final nibbāna and to Dhamma and to the Order of monks. May the revered Kaccāna accept me as a lay-disciple going for refuge from today forth for as long as life lasts.”</p>
