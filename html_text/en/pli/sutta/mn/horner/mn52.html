Now at that time the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka had arrived in Pātaliputta on some business or other. Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka approached a monk in Cock's Monastery; having approached, having greeted that monk, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka spoke thus to that monk: “Revered sir, where is the venerable Ānanda staying at present, for we are anxious to see the venerable Ānanda?” “Householder, the venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in Beluva hamlet.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en15' href='#pts-vp-en15'>PTS vp En 15</a> Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka, having concluded his business in Pātaliputta, approached the venerable Ānanda in Beluva hamlet; having approached, having greeted the venerable Ānanda, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>“Now is there, revered Ānanda, any one thing pointed out by that Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.350' href='#pts-vp-pli1.350'>PTS vp Pali 1.350</a>whereby if a monk dwell diligent, ardent, self-resolute, his mind, not (yet) freed, is freed; or the cankers, not (yet) completely destroyed, go to complete destruction; or he attains that matchless security from the bonds, not (yet) attained?” “There is one thing, householder, pointed out by that Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened one, whereby if a monk dwell diligent, ardent, self-resolute, his mind not (yet) freed, is freed; and also the cankers, not (yet) completely destroyed, go to complete destruction; and, too, he attains the matchless security from the bonds, not (yet) attained.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>“But what, revered Ānanda, is this one thing pointed out by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened one, whereby if a monk dwell diligent, ardent, self-resolute, his mind not (yet) freed, is freed; and also the cankers, not (yet) completely destroyed, go to complete destruction; and, too, he attains the matchless security from the bonds, not (yet) attained?” “As to this, householder, a monk, <span class='add'>(1)</span> aloof from the pleasures of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, entering into the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness, and is rapturous and joyful, abides in it. He reflects on this and comprehends: ‘This first meditation is effected and thought out. But whatever is effected and thought out, that is impermanent, it is liable to stopping.’ Firm in this, he attains the destruction of the cankers. If he does not attain the destruction of the cankers, then by this attachment to Dhamma, by this delight in Dhamma, by the destruction of the five fetters binding to this lower (shore), he is of spontaneous uprising, one who attains nibbāna there, not liable to return from that world. This, householder, is one thing pointed out by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened one, whereby if a monk dwell diligent, ardent, self-resolute, his mind not (yet) freed, is freed; and also the cankers, not (yet) completely destroyed, go to complete destruction; and, too, he attains the matchless security from the bonds, not (yet) attained.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>And again, householder, a monk, <span class='add'>(2)</span> by allaying initial and discursive thought, his mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point, enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought, is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful. He reflects on this and comprehends: ‘This second meditation is also effected and thought out. But whatever is effected and thought out, that is impermanent, it is liable to stopping.’ <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en16' href='#pts-vp-en16'>PTS vp En 16</a> Firm in this, he attains the destruction of the cankers. If he does not attain the destruction of the cankers, then by this attachment to Dhamma, by this delight in Dhamma, by the destruction of the five fetters binding to this lower (shore), he is of spontaneous uprising, one who attains nibbāna there, not liable to return from that world.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>And again, householder, a monk, <span class='add'>(3)</span> by the fading out of rapture, dwells with equanimity, attentive and clearly conscious, and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say: ‘Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,’ and he enters on and abides in the third meditation. He reflects on this and comprehends: ‘This third meditation is also effected and thought out. But whatever is effected and thought out, that is impermanent, it is liable to stopping.’ Firm in this, he attains the destruction of the cankers.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>And again, householder, a monk, <span class='add'>(4)</span> by getting rid of joy, by getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows, enters on and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy, and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness. He reflects on this and comprehends: ‘This fourth meditation is also effected and thought out. But whatever is effected and thought out, that is impermanent, it is liable to stopping.’ Firm in this, he attains the destruction of the cankers.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>And again, householder, a monk dwells, <span class='add'>(1)</span> having suffused the first quarter with a mind of friendliness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; just so above, below, across; he dwelt having suffused the whole world everywhere, in every way, with a mind of friendliness that was far-reaching, wide-spread, immeasurable, without enmity, without malevolence. He reflects on this and comprehends: ‘This freedom of mind that is friendliness is also effected and thought out. But whatever is effected and thought out, that is impermanent, it is liable to stopping.’ Firm in this, he attains the destruction of the cankers.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>And again, householder, a monk dwells, <span class='add'>(2)</span> having suffused the first quarter with a mind of compassion, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; just so above, below, across; he dwelt having suffused the whole world everywhere, in every way, with a mind of compassion that was far-reaching, wide-spread, immeasurable, without enmity, without malevolence.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>And again, householder, a monk dwells, <span class='add'>(3)</span> having suffused the first quarter with a mind of sympathetic joy, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; just so above, below, across; he dwelt having suffused the whole world everywhere, in every way, with a mind of sympathetic joy that was far-reaching, wide-spread, immeasurable, without enmity, without malevolence.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>And again, householder, a monk, <span class='add'>(1)</span> by wholly transcending perception of material shapes, by the going down of perception due to <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en17' href='#pts-vp-en17'>PTS vp En 17</a> sensory impressions, by not attending to perception of variety, thinking: ‘Ether is unending,’ enters on and abides in the plane of infinite ether.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>When this had been said, the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “Revered Ānanda, it is as though a man who was seeking for one opening to (some hidden) treasure were to come at one and the same time on eleven openings to the treasure. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.350' href='#pts-vp-pli1.350'>PTS vp Pali 1.353</a>Even so do I, revered sir, in seeking for one <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en18' href='#pts-vp-en18'>PTS vp En 18</a> door to the deathless, come to hear at one and the same time of eleven doors to the deathless. And too, revered sir, it is like a man's house that has eleven doors; if his house were on fire he could make himself safe by any one of the doors. Even so can I, revered sir, make myself safe by any one of these eleven doors to the deathless. Now, revered sir, members of other sects will look about for a fee for the teacher, but why should not I pay honour to the venerable Ānanda?”</p>
