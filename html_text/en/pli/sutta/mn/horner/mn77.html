</header>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd1'></a><a class='wp' id='wp1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> at one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove at the squirrels’ feeding place. Now at that time a number of very celebrated wanderers, such as Anugāra, Varadhara and the wanderer Sakuludāyin, and other celebrated wanderers, were staying in the wanderers’ park at the peacocks’ feeding place. Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for almsfood. Then it occurred to the Lord: “It is too early to walk for almsfood in Rājagaha. Suppose I were to approach the wanderers’ park, the peacocks’ feeding place and the wanderer Sakuludāyin?” Then the Lord approached the peacocks’ feeding place in the wanderers’ park.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd2'></a>Now at that time the wanderer Sakuludāyin was sitting down with the great company of wanderers shouting out with a loud noise, a great noise, talking various kinds of inferior talk that is to say: talk on kings, thieves, great ministers, armies, fears, battles, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, scents, relations, vehicles, villages, market towns, towns, the country, women, heroes, streets, wells, those departed before, talk of diversity, speculation about the world, speculation about the sea, talk about becoming or not becoming thus or thus.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd3'></a>The wanderer Sakuludāyin saw the Lord coming in the distance; seeing him, he called his own company to order, saying: “Good sirs, let there be little noise; do not, good sirs, make a noise; this is the recluse Gotama who is coming. The recluse Gotama wishes for little noise, is trained to little noise, praises little noise. So he may consider approaching, if he knows that this is a company of little noise.” Then these wanderers fell silent.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd4'></a>Then the Lord approached the wanderer Sakuludāyin. The wanderer Sakuludāyin spoke thus to the Lord: “Let the revered Gotama come, there is a welcome for the revered Gotama; it is long since the revered Gotama made this opportunity! That is to say for coming here. Let the revered Gotama sit down, this seat is ready.” Then the Lord sat down on the seat that was ready. And the wanderer Sakuludāyin, having taken a low seat, sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd5'></a>The Lord spoke thus to the wanderer Sakuludāyin as he was sitting down at a respectful distance: “What is the talk for which you are now gathered together here, Udāyin? <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en204'></a>And what was your talk that was interrupted?” “Let be that talk, revered sir, for which we are now gathered together here. It will not be difficult for the Lord to hear this talk later. Some time ago, revered sir, when divers members of other sects, recluses and brahmans, were gathered together and were sitting down in the debating hall, this chance conversation arose: ‘Indeed it is profitable for the people of Aṅga-Magadha, indeed it is well gotten by the people of Aṅga-Magadha that these leaders in religious life, heads of companies, heads of groups, teachers of groups, well known, famous founders of sects, held in high repute by the manyfolk, have come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd6'></a><span class='add'>[1]</span> This Pūraṇa Kassapa is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk; he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence. <span class='add'>[2]</span> This Makkhali Gosāla too is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk; he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence. <span class='add'>[3]</span> This Ajita of the hair-blanket too is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk; he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence. <span class='add'>[4]</span> This Pakudha Kaccāyana too is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk; he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence. <span class='add'>[5]</span> This Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son too is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk; he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence. <span class='add'>[6]</span> This Nātaputta the Jain too, is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk; he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence. <span class='add'>[7]</span> This recluse Gotama too is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk; he has come to Rājagaha for the rains-residence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd7'></a>Now of these lords, heads of companies, heads of groups, teachers of groups, well known, famous founders of sects, held in high repute by the manyfolk, which is revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples? And how do disciples, revering and respecting, live in dependence?” Some of those who were there spoke thus: ‘This Pūraṇa Kassapa is the head of a company, head of a group, teacher of a group, well known, a famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk. But he is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting him, live in dependence on Pūraṇa Kassapa. Once upon a time Pūraṇa Kassapa was teaching Dhamma to an innumerable assembly. But a certain disciple of his let it be heard: “Do not, good sirs, ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about this matter; he does not know about it, we know about it. Ask us about this matter, we can explain it to the good sirs.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd8'></a>Once upon a time Pūraṇa Kassapa, with outstretched arms <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en205'></a>and wailing, did not get the chance (to say): “Let the good sirs be quiet; do not, good sirs, make a noise. These are not asking the good sirs, they are asking us, we will explain to them.” Then many of Pūraṇa Kassapa's disciples, having refuted him, on seceding, said: “You do not understand this Dhamma and discipline, I understand this Dhamma and discipline. How can you understand this Dhamma and discipline? You are faring along wrongly, I am faring along rightly. There is sense in what I say, no sense in what you say. You said at the end what should have been said at the beginning, and said at the beginning what should have been said at the end. Your method is reversed, you are refuted, you are caught out, go away and think out your words, or unravel them if you can.” So Pūraṇa Kassapa is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting, live in dependence on Pūraṇa Kassapa. On the contrary, Pūraṇa Kassapa is reviled with abuse for his behaviour.’</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd9'></a>Some spoke thus: ‘This Makkhali Gosāla too is the head of a company, head of a group, teacher of a group, well known, a famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk. But he is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting him, live in dependence on Makkhali Gosāla. Once upon a time Makkhali Gosāla was teaching Dhamma to an innumerable assembly. But a certain disciple of his let it be heard: “Do not, good sirs, ask Makkhali Gosāla about this matter; he does not know about it, we know about it. Ask us about this matter, we can explain it to the good sirs.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd10'></a>Once upon a time Makkhali Gosāla, with outstretched arms and wailing, did not get the chance (to say): “Let the good sirs be quiet; do not, good sirs, make a noise. These are not asking the good sirs, they are asking us, we will explain to them.” Then many of Makkhali Gosāla's disciples, having refuted him, on seceding, said: “You do not understand this Dhamma and discipline, I understand this Dhamma and discipline. How can you understand this Dhamma and discipline? You are faring along wrongly, I am faring along rightly. There is sense in what I say, no sense in what you say. You said at the end what should have been said at the beginning, and said at the beginning what should have been said at the end. Your method is reversed, you are refuted, you are caught out, go away and think out your words, or unravel them if you can.” So Makkhali Gosāla is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting, live in dependence on Makkhali Gosāla. On the contrary, Makkhali Gosāla is reviled with abuse for his behaviour.’</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd11'></a>Some spoke thus: This Ajita of the hair blanket too is the head of a company, head of a group, teacher of a group, well known, a famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk. But he is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting him, live in dependence on Ajita of the hair blanket.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd12'></a>Once upon a time Ajita of the hair blanket was teaching dhamma to an innumerable assembly. But a certain disciple of his let it be heard: “Do not, good sirs, ask Ajita of the hair blanket about this matter; he does not know about it, we know about it. Ask us about this matter, we can explain it to the good sirs.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd13'></a>Once upon a time Ajita of the hair blanket, with outstretched arms and wailing, did not get the chance (to say): “Let the good sirs be quiet; do not, good sirs, make a noise. These are not asking the good sirs, they are asking us, we will explain to them.” Then many of Ajita of the hair blanket disciples, having refuted him, on seceding, said: “You do not understand this dhamma and discipline, I understand this dhamma and discipline. How can you understand this dhamma and discipline? You are faring along wrongly, I am faring along rightly. There is sense in what I say, no sense in what you say. You said at the end what should have been said at the beginning, and said at the beginning what should have been said at the end. Your method is reversed, you are refuted, you are caught out, go away and think out your words, or unravel them if you can.” So Ajita of the hair blanket is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting, live in dependence on Ajita of the hair blanket. On the contrary, Ajita of the hair blanket is reviled with abuse for his behaviour.’</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd14'></a>Some spoke thus: This Pakudha Kaccāyana too is the head of a company, head of a group, teacher of a group, well known, a famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk. But he is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting him, live in dependence on Pakudha Kaccāyana.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd15'></a>Once upon a time Pakudha Kaccāyana was teaching dhamma to an innumerable assembly. But a certain disciple of his let it be heard: “Do not, good sirs, ask Pakudha Kaccāyana about this matter; he does not know about it, we know about it. Ask us about this matter, we can explain it to the good sirs.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd16'></a>Once upon a time Pakudha Kaccāyana, with outstretched arms and wailing, did not get the chance (to say): “Let the good sirs be quiet; do not, good sirs, make a noise. These are not asking the good sirs, they are asking us, we will explain to them.” Then many of Pakudha Kaccāyana's disciples, having refuted him, on seceding, said: “You do not understand this dhamma and discipline, I understand this dhamma and discipline. How can you understand this dhamma and discipline? You are faring along wrongly, I am faring along rightly. There is sense in what I say, no sense in what you say. You said at the end what should have been said at the beginning, and said at the beginning what should have been said at the end. Your method is reversed, you are refuted, you are caught out, go away and think out your words, or unravel them if you can.” So Pakudha Kaccāyana is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting, live in dependence on Pakudha Kaccāyana. On the contrary, Pakudha Kaccāyana is reviled with abuse for his behaviour.’</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd17'></a>Some spoke thus: This Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son too is the head of a company, head of a group, teacher of a group, well known, a famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk. But he is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting him, live in dependence on Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son. Once upon a time Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son was teaching dhamma to an innumerable assembly. But a certain disciple of his let it be heard: “Do not, good sirs, ask Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son about this matter; he does not know about it, we know about it. Ask us about this matter, we can explain it to the good sirs.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd18'></a>Once upon a time Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son, with outstretched arms and wailing, did not get the chance (to say): “Let the good sirs be quiet; do not, good sirs, make a noise. These are not asking the good sirs, they are asking us, we will explain to them.” Then many of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son's disciples, having refuted him, on seceding, said: “You do not understand this dhamma and discipline, I understand this dhamma and discipline. How can you understand this dhamma and discipline? You are faring along wrongly, I am faring along rightly. There is sense in what I say, no sense in what you say.

Your method is reversed, you are refuted, you are caught out, go away and think out your words, or unravel them if you can.” So Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting, live in dependence on Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son. On the contrary, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi's son is reviled with abuse for his behaviour.’</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd19'></a>Some spoke thus: This Nātaputta the Jain too is the head of a company, head of a group, teacher of a group, well known, a famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk. But he is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting him, live in dependence on Nātaputta the Jain.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd20'></a>Once upon a time Nātaputta the Jain was teaching dhamma to an innumerable assembly. But a certain disciple of his let it be heard: “Do not, good sirs, ask Nātaputta the Jain about this matter; he does not know about it, we know about it. Ask us about this matter, we can explain it to the good sirs.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd21'></a>Once upon a time Nātaputta the Jain, with outstretched arms and wailing, did not get the chance (to say): “Let the good sirs be quiet; do not, good sirs, make a noise. These are not asking the good sirs, they are asking us, we will explain to them.” Then many of Nātaputta the Jain's disciples, having refuted him, on seceding, said: “You do not understand this dhamma and discipline, I understand this dhamma and discipline. How can you understand this dhamma and discipline? You are faring along wrongly, I am faring along rightly. There is sense in what I say, no sense in what you say. You said at the end what should have been said at the beginning, and said at the beginning what should have been said at the end. Your method is reversed, you are refuted, you are caught out, go away and think out your words, or unravel them if you can.” So Nātaputta the Jain is not revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, nor do disciples, revering and respecting, live in dependence on Nātaputta the Jain. On the contrary, Nātaputta the Jain is reviled with abuse for his behaviour.’</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd22'></a>Some spoke thus: ‘This recluse Gotama is the head of a company, head of a group, the teacher of a group, he is well known, the famous founder of a sect, held in high repute by the manyfolk. He is revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples; and disciples, revering and respecting the recluse Gotama, live in dependence on him.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd23'></a>Once upon a time the recluse Gotama was teaching Dhamma to an innumerable assembly. Then a certain disciple of the recluse Gotama coughed. A fellow Brahma-farer touched him with his knee and said: “Let the venerable one be quiet; let the venerable one make no noise. The Teacher, our Lord, is teaching Dhamma.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd24'></a><a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en206'></a>At the time when the recluse Gotama was teaching Dhamma to an innumerable assembly, there was the sound neither of expectoration nor of coughing among his disciples. Any group of people who were waiting were ready for him, thinking: “We will hear that Dhamma that the Lord will teach us.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd25'></a>It is as though a man at a crossing on a high road might press out a little pure honey, and any group of people who were waiting might be ready for him. Even so at the time when the recluse Gotama was teaching Dhamma to an innumerable assembly, there was the sound neither of expectoration nor of coughing among his disciples. Any group of people who were waiting were ready for him, thinking: “We will hear that Dhamma that the Lord will teach us.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd26'></a>And those disciples of the recluse Gotama who, quarrelling with fellow Brahma-farers and disavowing the training, return to the secular life, even these are speakers in praise of the Teacher, they are speakers in praise of Dhamma and speakers in praise of the Order. They censure only themselves, they do not censure others, but say: “It is we ourselves that are unfortunate, it is we that are of little merit, in that we, although we have gone forth thus in this Dhamma and discipline that are well taught, are unable for as long as life lasts to fare the Brahma-faring wholly complete, wholly purified.” These, becoming monastery attendants or lay-disciples, live undertaking the five rules of training.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd27'></a>Thus it is that the recluse Gotama is revered, respected, esteemed, honoured by disciples, and that disciples, revering and respecting the recluse Gotama, live in dependence on him.’”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd28'></a>“But how many things do you behold in me, Udāyin, for which my disciples revere, respect, esteem and honour me, and revering and respecting, live in dependence (on me)?” “I, revered sir, behold five things for which disciples revere, respect, and honour the Lord, and, revering and respecting, live in dependence. What are the five?</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd29'></a><span class='add'>[1]</span> Revered sir, the Lord eats little and speaks in praise of eating little. That the Lord eats little and speaks in praise of eating little, this is the first thing that I, revered sir, behold in the Lord for which disciples revere, respect, and honour the Lord, and, revering and respecting, live in dependence. <span class='add'>[2]</span> And again, revered sir, the Lord is contented with any kind of robe-material and speaks in praise of content with any kind of robe-material. This is the second thing that I, revered sir, behold in the Lord for which disciples revere, respect, and honour the Lord, and, revering and respecting, live in dependence. <span class='add'>[3]</span> <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en207'></a>And again, revered sir, the Lord is contented with any kind of almsfood and speaks in praise of content with any kind of almsfood. This is the third thing that I, revered sir, behold in the Lord for which disciples revere, respect, and honour the Lord, and, revering and respecting, live in dependence. <span class='add'>[4]</span> And again, revered sir, the Lord is contented with any kind of lodgings and speaks in praise of content with any kind of lodgings. This is the fourth thing that I, revered sir, behold in the Lord for which disciples revere, respect, and honour the Lord, and, revering and respecting, live in dependence. <span class='add'>[5]</span> And again, revered sir, the Lord is aloof and speaks in praise of aloofness. That the Lord is aloof and speaks in praise of aloofness, this is the fifth that I, revered sir, behold in the Lord for which disciples revere, respect, and honour the Lord, and, revering and respecting, live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd30'></a>These, revered sir, are the five things I behold in the Lord for which disciples revere, respect, and honour the Lord, and, revering and respecting, live in dependence.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd31'></a>“‘The recluse Gotama eats little and speaks in praise of eating little”, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, there are disciples of mine, Udāyin, who live on a saucer of food and on half a saucer of food and on a fruit of the vilva tree and on half a fruit of the vilva tree. But I, Udāyin, sometimes eat to the full of this bowl, and I eat more than that. ‘The recluse Gotama eats little and speaks in praise of eating little’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, it would not be, Udāyin, those of my disciples who live on a saucer of food and on half a saucer of food and on a fruit of the vilva tree and on half a fruit of the vilva tree who would revere, respect, esteem and honour me for this behaviour (of mine) and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd32'></a>‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe-material and speaks in praise of content with any kind of robe-material’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, there are disciples of mine, Udāyin, who are wearers of rag-robes taken from a dust-heap, and who wear robes that are worn thin; collecting shreds of <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en208'></a>cloth from a cemetery, a rubbish heap or shop and having made up an outer cloak, they wear it. I, Udāyin, sometimes wear householders’ robe-material, strengthening it if it is worn thin with thread from the white gourd. ‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of robe-material and speaks in praise of content with any kind of robe-material’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, it would not be, Udāyin, those of my disciples who are wearers of rag-robes taken from a dust-heap, and who wear robes that are worn thin; or those who, collecting shreds of cloth from a cemetery, a rubbish heap or shop and who, having made up an outer cloak, wear it, who would revere, respect, esteem, honour me for this behaviour (of mine) and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd33'></a>‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood and speaks in praise of content with any kind of almsfood’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, there are disciples of mine, Udāyin, who eat only what is received into the begging bowl, who walk on an uninterrupted alms-round, pleased with scraps of food; these, having gone in amid the houses, even if offered a seat do not consent (to accept it). But I, Udāyin, sometimes eat where I am invited: rice, rice-gruel, rice from which the black grains have been removed, a variety of curries, a variety of condiments. ‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of almsfood and speaks in praise of content with any kind of almsfood’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, it would not be, Udāyin, those of my disciples who eat only what is received into the begging-bowl, who walk on an uninterrupted alms-round, pleased with scrap of food, and who, having gone in amid the houses, even if offered a seat do not consent (to accept it), who would revere, respect, esteem and honour me for this behaviour (of mine) and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd34'></a>‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of lodging and speaks in praise of content with any kind of lodging’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, there are disciples <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en209'></a>of mine, Udāyin, who live at the roots of trees, in the open air, and who for eight months do not go under a roof. But I, Udāyin, sometimes stay in gabled houses, smeared inside and out, sheltered from the winds, having door-bolts that fasten and windows that close. ‘The recluse Gotama is content with any kind of lodging and speaks in praise of content with any kind of lodging’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, it would not be, Udāyin, those of my disciples who live at the roots of trees, in the open air, and who for eight months do not go under a roof, who would revere, respect, esteem and honour me for this behaviour (of mine) and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd35'></a>‘The recluse Gotama is aloof and speaks in praise of aloofness’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, there are disciples of mine, Udāyin, who have gone to remote lodgings in the forest and who, having plunged into remote lodgings in forest and jungle, stay there; these return to the midst of the Order every half-month for the recitation of the Obligations. But I, Udāyin, sometimes stay crowded round by monks and nuns, men and women lay-disciples, by kings and kings’ chief ministers, by leaders and disciples of other sects.’ ‘The recluse Gotama is aloof and speaks in praise of aloofness’, if it were for this, Udāyin, that disciples would revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence, it would not be, Udāyin, those of my disciples who have gone to remote lodgings in the forest and who, having plunged into remote lodgings in forest and jungle, stay there, but who return to the midst of the Order every half-month for the recitation of the Obligations, who would revere, respect, esteem and honour me for this behaviour (of mine) and, revering and respecting, would live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd36'></a>It is thus, Udāyin, for these five ways of behaving, that disciples do not revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, live in dependence. But there are, Udāyin, five other things for which disciples revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, live in dependence. What are the five?</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd37'></a><span class='add'>[1]</span> As to this, Udāyin, disciples of mine admire the higher morality, and think: ‘The recluse Gotama is of moral habit, he is possessed of the most excellent body of moral habit.’ Inasmuch, <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en210'></a>Udāyin, as disciples of mine admire the higher morality, and think: ‘The recluse Gotama is of moral habit, he is possessed of the most excellent body of moral habit.’ This is the first thing, Udāyin, for which disciples of mine revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd38'></a><span class='add'>[2]</span> And again, Udāyin, disciples of mine admire the surpassing knowledge-and-vision, and think: ‘When the recluse Gotama says: “I know, I see”, it is because he does know, does see. The recluse Gotama teaches Dhamma from super-knowledge, not without super-knowledge; the recluse Gotama teaches Dhamma that has a causal basis, not without a causal basis; the recluse Gotama teaches Dhamma that is convincing, not unconvincing.’ Inasmuch, Udāyin, as disciples of mine admire the surpassing knowledge-and-vision, and think: ‘When the recluse Gotama says: “I know, I see”, it is because he does know, does see. The recluse Gotama teaches Dhamma from super-knowledge, not without super-knowledge; the recluse Gotama teaches Dhamma that has a causal basis, not without a causal basis; the recluse Gotama teaches Dhamma that is convincing, not unconvincing.’ This is the second thing, Udāyin, for which disciples of mine revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd39'></a><span class='add'>[3]</span> And again, Udāyin, disciples of mine admire the higher wisdom, and the situation does not occur when they think: ‘The recluse Gotama is wise; he is endowed with the most excellent body of wisdom. (Yet) he will not see (in advance) a future way of speech nor will he refute with Dhamma a present opposed teaching that is rightly (to be) refuted.’ What do you think about this, Udāyin? Could disciples of mine, knowing thus, seeing thus, interrupt a chance conversation?” “No, revered sir.” “It is not I, Udāyin, that expect instruction from disciples; on the contrary, it is the disciples themselves that expect instruction from me. So that, Udāyin, the situation does not occur when disciples <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en211'></a>of mine who admire the higher wisdom think: ‘He would neither see (in advance) a future way of speech nor would he refute with Dhamma a present opposed teaching that is rightly (to be) refuted.’ This is the third thing, Udāyin, for which disciples of mine revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd40'></a><span class='add'>[4]</span> And again, Udāyin, those disciples of mine who are beset by some anguish, overwhelmed by anguish, having approached me, ask about the ariyan truth of anguish. On being asked by them about the ariyan truth of anguish, I explain. I bend my mind to the answer to their question. And again, Udāyin, those disciples of mine who are beset by some anguish, overwhelmed by anguish, having approached me, ask about the ariyan truth of the uprising of anguish. On being asked by them about the ariyan truth of anguish, I explain. I bend my mind to the answer to their question.

<p><a class='bd' id='bd48'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine develop the eight Deliverances. Being in the fine-material sphere, he sees material shapes; this is the first deliverance. Not perceiving material shape internally he sees external material shapes; this is the second deliverance. By thinking of the Fair, he is intent on it; this is the third deliverance. By passing quite beyond perceptions of material shapes, by the going down of perceptions of sensory reactions, by not attending to perceptions of variety, thinking: ‘Ether is unending’ entering on the plane of infinite ether, he abides in it; this is the fourth deliverance.

<p><a class='bd' id='bd49'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine develop the eight spheres of mastery. <span class='add'>[1]</span> Perceiving material shape internally, one sees external material shapes, small, comely, ugly, and he is one perceiving thus: ‘Having mastered them, I know, I see’; this is the first sphere of mastery. <span class='add'>[2]</span> Perceiving material shape internally, another sees external material shapes, illimitable, comely, ugly, and he is one perceiving thus: ‘Having mastered them, I know, I see’; this is the second sphere of mastery. <span class='add'>[3]</span> Not perceiving material shape internally, another sees external material shapes, small, comely, ugly, and he is one perceiving thus: ‘Having mastered them, I know, I see’; this is the third sphere of mastery. <span class='add'>[4]</span> Not perceiving material shape internally, another sees external material shapes, illimitable, comely, ugly, and he is one perceiving thus: ‘Having mastered them, I know, I see’; this is the fourth sphere of mastery. <span class='add'>[5]</span> Not perceiving material shape internally, another sees external material shapes that are blue-green, blue-green in colour, blue-green in appearance, reflecting blue-green. As the flax blossom is blue-green, blue-green in colour, blue-green in appearance, reflecting blue-green; or again, as that fine muslin of Benares, of delicate finish on both sides, is blue-green, blue-green in colour, blue-green in appearance, reflecting blue-green, even so anyone who, not perceiving material shape internally, sees external material shapes that are blue-green, blue-green in colour, blue-green in appearance, reflecting blue-green, is one perceiving thus: ‘Having mastered them, I know, I see’ this is the fifth sphere of mastery. <span class='add'>[6]</span> Not perceiving material shape internally, another sees external material shapes that are yellow, yellow in colour, yellow in appearance, reflecting yellow.

<p><a class='bd' id='bd50'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine develop the ten spheres of the devices. <span class='add'>[1]</span> One is aware of the earth-device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[2]</span> another is aware of the water-device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[3]</span> another is aware of the fire-device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[4]</span> another is aware of the wind-device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[5]</span> another is aware of the blue-green device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[6]</span> another is aware of the yellow device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[7]</span> another is aware of the red device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[8]</span> another is aware of the white device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[9]</span> another is aware of the space device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable; <span class='add'>[10]</span> another is aware of the consciousness device above, below, across, undivided, illimitable. As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd51'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine develop the four meditations. <span class='add'>[1]</span> Herein, Udāyin, a monk, aloof from pleasures of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, enters and abides in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness, and is rapturous and joyful. He drenches, saturates, permeates, suffuses this very body with the rapture and joy that are born of aloofness; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused with the rapture and joy that are <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en216'></a>born of aloofness. Udāyin, as a skilled bath-attendant or his apprentice, having sprinkled bath-powder into a bronze vessel, might knead it together with drops of water until the ball of lather has taken up moisture, is drenched with moisture, suffused with moisture inside and out, but there is no oozing, even so, Udāyin, does a monk drench, saturate, permeate, suffuse this very body with the rapture and joy that are born of aloofness; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused with the rapture and joy that are born of aloofness. <span class='add'>[2]</span> And again, Udāyin, a monk, by allaying initial and discursive thought, with the mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point, enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought, is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful. He drenches, saturates, permeates, suffuses this very body with the rapture and joy that are born of concentration; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused with the rapture and joy that are born of concentration. Udāyin, as a pool of water with water welling up within it, but which has no inlet for water from the eastern side, no inlet for water from the western side, no inlet for water from the northern side, no inlet for water from the southern side, and even if the god did not send down showers upon it from time to time, yet a current of cool water having welled up from that pool would drench, saturate, permeate, suffuse that pool with cool water; there would be no part of that pool that was not suffused with cool water. Even so, Udāyin, does a monk drench, saturate, permeate, suffuse this very body with the rapture and joy that are born of concentration; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused with the rapture and joy that are born of concentration. <span class='add'>[3]</span> And again, Udāyin, a monk by the fading out of rapture, dwells with equanimity, attentive and clearly conscious and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say: ‘Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,’ and he enters on and abides in the third meditation. He drenches, saturates, permeates, suffuses this very body with the joy that has no rapture; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused with the joy that has no rapture. As in a pond of white lotuses or a pond of red lotuses or a pond of blue lotuses, some white lotuses or red lotuses or blue lotuses are born in the water, grow up in the water, never rising above the surface but flourishing beneath it, these from their roots to their tips are drenched, saturated, permeated, suffused by cool water. Even so, Udāyin, a monk drenches, saturates, permeates, suffuses this very body with the joy that has no rapture; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused with the joy that has no rapture. <span class='add'>[4]</span> And again, Udāyin, a monk by getting rid of joy and by getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows, enters on and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy, and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness. He, having suffused this very body with a mind that is <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en217'></a>utterly pure, utterly clean, comes to be sitting down; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused with a mind that is utterly pure, utterly clean. Udāyin, as a monk might be sitting down who has clothed himself including his head with a white cloth, no part of his whole body would not be suffused with the white cloth. Even so, Udāyin, a monk, having suffused this very body with a mind that is utterly pure, utterly clean, comes to be sitting down; there is no part of his whole body that is not suffused by a mind that is utterly pure, utterly clean. As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd52'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine comprehend thus: ‘This body of mine, having material shape, made of the four great elements, originated from mother and father, nourished on gruel and sour milk, is of a nature to be constantly rubbed away, pounded away, broken up and scattered, but this consciousness of mine is fastened there, bound there. Udāyin, as an emerald jewel, of lovely water, well cut into eight facets, translucent, flawless, having all good qualities, might be strung on a thread, blue-green or yellow or red or white or orange-coloured; and a man with vision, having put it in his hand, might reflect: ‘This emerald jewel of lovely water, well cut into eight facets, translucent, flawless, having all good qualities, might be strung on a thread, blue-green or yellow or red or white or orange-coloured.’ Even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine know thus: ‘This body of mine, having material shape, made of the four great elements, originated from mother and father, nourished on gruel and sour milk, is of a nature to be constantly rubbed away, pounded away, broken up and scattered, but this consciousness of mine is fastened there, bound there.’ As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd53'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine from this body (mentally) produce (another) body, having material shape, mind-made, having all its major and minor parts, not deficient in any sense-organ. As, Udāyin, a man might draw an arrow from a reed and might think <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en218'></a>thus: ‘This is the reed, this the arrow, the reed is one thing, the arrow another; it is from the reed that the arrow has been drawn’; or again, Udāyin, as a man might draw a sword from the scabbard and might think thus: ‘This is the sword, this the scabbard, the sword is one thing, the scabbard another; it is from the scabbard that the sword has been drawn’; or again, Udāyin, as a man might take a snake out of the slough and might think thus: ‘This is the snake, this the slough, the snake is one thing, the slough another; it is from the slough that the snake has been taken out.’ Even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which my disciples from this body (mentally) produce (another) body, having material shape, mind-made, having all its major and minor parts, not deficient in any sense-organ. As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd54'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine experience the various forms of psychic power; <span class='add'>[1]</span> having been one they become manifold; <span class='add'>[2]</span> having been manifold they become one; <span class='add'>[3]</span> manifest or invisible they go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as if through air; <span class='add'>[4]</span> they plunge into the ground and up again as if in water; <span class='add'>[5]</span> they walk upon the water without parting it as if on the ground; <span class='add'>[6]</span> sitting cross-legged they travel through the air like a bird on the wing; <span class='add'>[7]</span> and with their hands they rub and stroke this moon and sun which are of such power and majesty, and even as far as the Brahma-world they have power with the person. As, Udāyin, a skilled potter or potter's apprentice from properly prepared clay could make whatever shaped clay vessel he wished; or as a skilled ivory-worker or ivory-worker's apprentice from properly prepared ivory could make whatever shaped ivory vessel he wished; or as a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice from properly prepared gold could make whatever shaped gold vessel he wished, even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine experience the various forms of psychic power experience the various forms of psychic power; <span class='add'>[1]</span> having been one they become manifold; <span class='add'>[2]</span> having been manifold they become one; <span class='add'>[3]</span> manifest or invisible they go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as if through air; <span class='add'>[4]</span> they plunge into the ground and up again as if in water; they walk upon the water without parting it as if on the ground; <span class='add'>[5]</span> sitting cross-legged they travel through the air like a bird on the wing; <span class='add'>[6]</span> and with their hands they rub and stroke this moon and sun which are of such power and majesty, and even as far as the Brahma-world <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en219'></a>they have power with the person. As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd55'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine, through the purified deva-element of hearing, surpassing that of men, hear both sounds; the deva-like and the human, those that are distant and those that are near. As, Udāyin, a powerful conch-blower could, without trouble, inform the four quarters, even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine through the purified deva-element of hearing surpassing that of men, hear both sounds; the deva-like and the human, those that are distant and those that are near. As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd56'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine comprehend with the mind the minds of other beings, of other individuals; they comprehend the mind with attachment as a mind with attachment; they comprehend the mind without attachment as a mind without attachment; they comprehend the mind with aversion as a mind with aversion; they comprehend the mind without aversion as a mind without aversion; they comprehend the mind with confusion as a mind with confusion; they comprehend the mind without confusion as a mind without confusion; they comprehend the mind that is contracted as a mind that is contracted; they comprehend the mind that is distracted as a mind that is distracted; they comprehend the mind that has become great as a mind that has become great; they comprehend the mind that has not become great as a mind that has not become great; they comprehend the mind with (some other mental state) superior to it as a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it; they comprehend the mind with no (other mental state) superior to it as a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it; they comprehend the mind that is composed as a mind that is composed; they comprehend the mind that is not composed as a mind that is not composed; they comprehend the mind that is freed as a mind that is freed; they comprehend the mind that is not freed as a mind that is not freed. Udāyin, it is like a woman or a man, young and of tender years, fond of adornment, who, regarding the reflection of (her or his) own face in a perfectly pure and perfectly clean mirror or in a bowl of clear water would, if it had a mole on it, know that it had, and if not, would know that it had not. Even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine comprehend with the <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en220'></a>mind the mind of other beings, of other individuals; they comprehend the mind with attachment as a mind with attachment; they comprehend the mind without attachment as a mind without attachment; they comprehend the mind with aversion as a mind with aversion; they comprehend the mind without aversion as a mind without aversion; they comprehend the mind with confusion as a mind with confusion; they comprehend the mind without confusion as a mind without confusion; they comprehend the mind that is contracted as a mind that is contracted; they comprehend the mind that is distracted as a mind that is distracted; they comprehend the mind that has become great as a mind that has become great; they comprehend the mind that has not become great as a mind that has not become great; they comprehend the mind with (some other mental state) superior to it as a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it; they comprehend the mind with no (other mental state) superior to it as a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it; they comprehend the mind that is composed as a mind that is composed; they comprehend the mind that is not composed as a mind that is not composed; they comprehend the mind that is freed as a mind that is freed; they comprehend the mind that is not freed as a mind that is not freed.

<p><a class='bd' id='bd57'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine recollect a variety of former habitations, that is to say: one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many an eon of integration, many an eon of disintegration, many an eon of integration-disintegration; such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this I arose here. Thus may I remember (my) divers former habitations in all their modes and detail,’ Udāyin, it is like a man who might go from his own village to another village, and who from that village might go to another village and from that village might return to his own village. This might occur to him: ‘I went from my own village to a certain other village where I stood thus, sat down thus, spoke thus, was silent thus; and from that village I went to another village where too I stood thus, sat down thus, spoke thus, was silent thus; then from that village I returned to my own village.’ Even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine recollect a variety of former habitations, that is to say: one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many an eon of integration, many an eon of disintegration, many an eon of integration-disintegration; such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end.

<p><a class='bd' id='bd58'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, see beings as they are passing hence and coming to be, and they comprehend that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going, according to the consequences of deeds and they think: Indeed these worthy beings were possessed of wrong conduct in body, speech and thought, they were scoffers at the ariyans, holding a wrong view, incurring deeds <a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en221'></a>consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body, speech and thought, who were not scoffers at the ariyans, holding a right view, incurring deeds consequent on a right view, these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world. Thus with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, see beings as they are passing hence and coming to be, and they comprehend that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going, according to the consequences of deeds. It is as if, Udāyin, there might be two houses with doors, and if a man with vision were standing there between them he might see people entering and leaving the houses, visiting and strolling about. Even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, see beings as they are passing hence and coming to be, and they comprehend that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going, according to the consequences of deeds and they think: Indeed these worthy beings were possessed of wrong conduct in body, speech and thought, they were scoffers at the ariyans, holding a wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body, speech and thought, who were not scoffers at the ariyans, holding a right view, incurring deeds consequent on a right view, these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world. Thus with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, see beings as they are passing hence and coming to be, and they comprehend that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going, according to the consequences of deeds. As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd59'></a>And again, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine by the destruction of the cankers, having realised here-now through their own super-knowledge the freedom of mind and the freedom through intuitive wisdom that are cankerless, enter and abide therein. Udāyin, it is like a pure, limpid, serene pool of water where, if a man with vision were standing on the bank, he might see oysters and shells, and gravel and pebbles, and shoals of fish moving about and keeping still. It might occur to him: ‘This pool of water is pure, limpid, serene, here these oysters and shells, and the gravel and pebbles, and shoals of fish are moving about and keeping still.’ Even so, Udāyin, a course has been pointed out by me for disciples, practising which disciples of mine by the destruction of the cankers, having realised here-now through their own super-knowledge the freedom of mind and the freedom through wisdom that are cankerless, enter and abide therein. As to this, many of my disciples abide attained to accomplishment and to going beyond through super-knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd60'></a>This, Udāyin, is the fifth thing for which disciples of mine revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, live in dependence.</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd61'></a><a class='pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en222'></a>These, Udāyin, are the five things for which disciples of mine revere, respect, esteem and honour me and, revering and respecting, live in dependence.”</p>
<p><a class='bd' id='bd62'></a>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, the wanderer Sakuludāyin rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
