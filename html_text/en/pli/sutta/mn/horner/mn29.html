<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak not long after Devadatta had left (the Order). There the Lord addressed the monks concerning Devadatta:</p>
<p>“Here, monks, some young man of family has gone forth from home into homelessness through faith and thinks: ‘I am beset by birth, ageing and dying, by grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair. I am beset by anguish, overwhelmed by anguish. Maybe the annihilation of this whole mass of anguish can be shown.’ He, gone forth thus, receives gains, honours, fame. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he becomes satisfied, his purpose is fulfilled. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he exalts himself and disparages others, saying: ‘It is I who am a recipient, being famous, but those other monks are little known, of little esteem.’ He, because of the gains, honours, fame, is exultant, indolent, and falls into sloth; being indolent, he dwells ill.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Monks, it is like a man walking about aiming at the pith, seeking for the pith, looking <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en239' href='#pts-vp-en239'>PTS vp En 239</a> about for the pith of a great, stable and pithy tree, who passes by the pith itself, passes by the softwood, passes by the bark, passes by the young shoots, and who, having cut down the branches and foliage, might go away taking them with him thinking they were the pith. A man with vision, having seen him, might say: ‘Indeed this good man does not know the pith, he does not know the softwood, he does not know the bark, he does not know the young shoots, he does not know the branches and foliage, inasmuch as this good man, walking about aiming at the pith, seeking for the pith, looking about for the pith of a great, stable and pithy tree, passes by the pith itself, passes by the softwood, passes by the bark, passes by the young shoots, and having cut down the branches and foliage, is going away taking them with him thinking they are the pith. So will he not get the good that could be done by the pith because it is the pith.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Even so, monks, some young man of family here, having gone forth from home into homelessness through faith, thinks: ‘I am beset by birth, ageing and dying, by grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, I am beset by anguish, overwhelmed by anguish. Maybe the annihilation of this whole mass of anguish can be shown.’ He, gone forth thus, receives gains, honours, fame. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he becomes satisfied, his purpose is fulfilled. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he exalts himself and disparages others, saying: ‘It is I who am a recipient, being famous, but those other monks are little known, of little esteem.’ He, because of the gains, honours, fame, is exultant, indolent, and falls into sloth; being indolent, he dwells ill. Monks, this is called a monk who takes hold of the branches and foliage of the Brahma-faring, and because of this he fails of (full) accomplishment.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>But, monks, some young man of family here comes to have gone forth from home into homelessness through faith, and thinks: ‘I am beset by birth, ageing and dying, by grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, I am beset by anguish, overwhelmed by anguish. Maybe the annihilation of this whole mass of anguish can be shown.’ He, gone forth thus, receives gains, honours, fame. But because of the gains, honours, fame, he does not become satisfied, his purpose is not fulfilled. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he does not exalt himself, he does not <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en240' href='#pts-vp-en240'>PTS vp En 240</a> disparage others. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he is not exultant, he is not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he attains success in moral habit. He, because of this success in moral habit, becomes satisfied, his purpose is fulfilled. Because of this success in moral habit, he exalts himself, disparages others, thinking: ‘It is I who am of (good) moral habit, lovely in character, but these other monks are of wrong moral habit, evil in character.’ Because of this success in moral habit, he is exultant, he is indolent, he falls into sloth. Being indolent, he dwells ill.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Monks, it is like a man walking about aiming at the pith, seeking for the pith, looking about for the pith of a great, stable and pithy tree, who passes by the pith itself, passes by the softwood, passes by the bark, and who, having cut off the young shoots, might go away taking them with him thinking they were the pith.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Monks, it is like might go away taking it with him thinking it was the pith.

So will he not get the good that could be done by the pith because it is the pith.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>Even so, monks some young man of family here comes to have gone forth from home into homelessness through faith, and thinks: ‘I am beset by birth, ageing and dying, by grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, I am beset by anguish, overwhelmed by anguish.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>But, monks, some young man of family here comes to have gone forth from home into homelessness through faith, and thinks: ‘I am beset by birth, ageing and dying, by grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, I am beset by anguish, overwhelmed by anguish. Maybe the annihilation of this whole mass of anguish can be shown.’ He, gone forth thus, receives gains, honours, fame.

He, because of this success in moral habit, does not exalt himself, does not disparage others. He, because of this success in moral habit, is not exultant, he is not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he gains success in concentration. He, because of this success in concentration, becomes satisfied, but not yet is his purpose fulfilled. He, because of this success in concentration, does not exalt himself, does not disparage others. He, because of this success in concentration, is not exultant, not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he gains knowledge and insight. He, because of this knowledge and insight, becomes satisfied, but not yet is his purpose fulfilled. Because of this knowledge and vision he does not exalt himself, does not disparage others. Because of this knowledge and vision, he is not exultant, he is not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he obtains release as to things of time. The situation occurs, monks, when that monk falls away from freedom as to things of time.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>Monks, it is like a man walking about aiming at the pith, seeking for the pith, looking about for the pith of a great, stable and pithy tree, and who, having cut out the pith itself, might go away taking it with him, knowing it to be the pith. A man with vision, having seen him, might say: ‘Indeed this good man knows the pith, he knows the softwood, he knows the bark, he knows the young <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en244' href='#pts-vp-en244'>PTS vp En 244</a> shoots, he knows the branches and foliage, inasmuch as this good man walking about aiming at the pith, seeking for the pith, looking about for the pith of a great, stable and pithy tree, having cut out the pith itself, is going away taking it with him, knowing it to be the pith. So will he get the good that could be done by the pith because it is the pith.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>Even so, monks, some young man of family here comes to have gone forth from home into homelessness through faith, and thinks: ‘I am beset by birth, ageing and dying, by grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair, I am beset by anguish, overwhelmed by anguish. Maybe the annihilation of this whole mass of anguish can be shown.’ He, gone forth thus, receives gains, honours, fame. But because of the gains, honours, fame, he does not become satisfied, his purpose is not fulfilled. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he does not exalt himself, he does not disparage others. Because of the gains, honours, fame, he is not exultant, he is not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he attains success in moral habit. He, because of this success in moral habit, becomes satisfied, but not yet is his purpose fulfilled. He, because of this success in moral habit, does not exalt himself, does not disparage others. He, because of this success in moral habit, is not exultant, he is not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he gains success in concentration. He, because of this success in concentration, becomes satisfied, but not yet is his purpose fulfilled. He, because of this success in concentration, does not exalt himself, does not disparage others. He, because of this success in concentration, is not exultant, not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he gains knowledge and insight. He, because of this knowledge and insight, becomes satisfied, but not yet is his purpose fulfilled. Because of this knowledge and vision he does not exalt himself, does not disparage others. Because of this knowledge and vision, he is not exultant, he is not indolent, he does not fall into sloth. Being diligent, he obtains release as to things that are timeless. This is impossible, monks, it cannot come to pass, that a monk should fall away from freedom as to things that are timeless.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>So it is, monks, that this Brahma-faring is not for advantage in gains, honours, fame; it is not for advantage in moral habit, it is not for advantage in concentration, it is not for advantage in knowledge and vision. That, monks, which is unshakable freedom of<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en245' href='#pts-vp-en245'>PTS vp En 245</a>  mind, this is the goal, monks, of this Brahma-faring, this the pith, this the culmination.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd17' href='#dd17'>Dhdas-bh 17</a>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
