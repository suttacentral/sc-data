<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time a pernicious view had arisen like this in a monk named Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer: “In so far as I understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord, it is that in following those things called stumbling-blocks by the Lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Several monks heard: “A pernicious view has arisen to the monk named Ariṭṭha, who was formerly a vulture-trainer, like this: ‘In so far as I understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord, it is that in following those things called stumbling-blocks by the Lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.’” Then these monks approached the monk Ariṭṭha, who had formerly been a vulture-trainer; having approached, they spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha, who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, reverend Ariṭṭha, that a pernicious view has arisen in you, like this: ‘In so far as I understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord, it is that in following those things called stumbling-blocks by the Lord, there is no stumbling-block at all’?”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly, your reverences, as I understand <i>Dhamma</i> taught by the Lord, it is that in following those things called stumbling-blocks by the Lord, there is no stumbling-block at all.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Then these monks, anxious to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer from that pernicious view, questioned him, cross-questioned him, and pressed for the reasons,<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en168' href='#pts-vp-en168'>PTS vp En 168</a>  and said:</p>
<p>“Do not speak thus, reverend Ariṭṭha, do not misrepresent the Lord; misrepresentation of the Lord is not at all seemly, and the Lord certainly would not speak thus. For, in many a figure, reverend Ariṭṭha, are things called stumbling-blocks by the Lord, and in following these there is a veritable stumbling-block.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are said by the Lord to be of little satisfaction, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to a skeleton, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to a lump of meat, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to a torch of dry grass, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to a pit of glowing embers, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to a dream, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to something borrowed, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to the fruits of a tree, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to a slaughterhouse, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to an impaling stake, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.</p>
<p>Sense-pleasures are likened by the Lord to a snake's head, of much pain, of much tribulation, wherein is more peril.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Yet the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer even while being questioned, cross-questioned and pressed for his reasons by these monks, expressed that pernicious view as before, obstinately holding and adhering to it:</p>

<p>Since we, Lord, were unable to dissuade the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer from that pernicious view, we are therefore telling this matter to the Lord.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Lord,” and this monk, having answered the Lord in assent, approached the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer, and having approached, spoke thus to the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer:</p>

<p>“How could this be, Lord? It is not so, Lord.”</p>
<p>When this had been said, the monk Ariṭṭha who had formerly been a vulture-trainer sat down silent, ashamed, his shoulders drooped, his head lowered, brooding, speechless.

<p>He, regarding thus that which does not exist, will not be anxious.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd28' href='#dd28'>Dhdas-bh 28</a>When this had been said, a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>“In this case, monk, it occurs to somebody:</p>
<p>‘What was certainly mine is certainly not mine (now); what might certainly be mine, there is certainly no chance of my getting.’</p>
<p>He grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, and falls into disillusionment.</p>
<p>Even so, monks, does there come to be anxiety about something objective that does not exist.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd29' href='#dd29'>Dhdas-bh 29</a>“But might there be, Lord, no anxiety about something objective that does not exist?”</p>

<p>He does not grieve, mourn, lament, he does not beat his breast, he does not fall into disillusionment.</p>
<p>Even so, monk, does there come to be no anxiety about something objective that does not exist.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd30' href='#dd30'>Dhdas-bh 30</a>“But, Lord, might there be anxiety about something subjective that does not exist?”</p>
<p>“There might be, monk,’ the Lord said.</p>
<p>“In this case, monk, the view occurs to someone:</p>
<p>‘This the world this the self; after<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en176' href='#pts-vp-en176'>PTS vp En 176</a>  dying, I will become permanent, lasting, eternal, not liable to change, I will stand fast like unto the eternal.’</p>
<p>He hears <i>Dhamma</i> as it is being taught by the Tathāgata or by a disciple of the Tathāgata for rooting out all resolve for, bias, tendency and addiction to view and causal relation, for tranquillising all the activities, for casting away all attachment, for the destruction of craving, for dispassion, stopping, nibbāna.</p>
<p>It occurs to him thus:</p>
<p>‘I will surely be annihilated, I will surely be destroyed, I will surely not be.’</p>
<p>He grieves, mourns, laments, beats his breast, and falls into disillusionment.</p>
<p>Thus, monk, there comes to be anxiety about something subjective that does not exist.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd31' href='#dd31'>Dhdas-bh 31</a>“But, Lord, might there be no anxiety about something subjective that does not exist?”</p>

<p>‘This the world this the self, after dying, I will become permanent, lasting, eternal, not liable to change, I will stand fast like unto the eternal.’</p>

<p>But it does not occur to him thus:</p>
<p>‘I will surely be annihilated, I will surely be destroyed, I will surely not be.’</p>
<p>So he does not grieve, mourn, lament, he does not beat his breast, he does not fall into disillusionment.</p>
<p>Thus, monk, does there come to be no anxiety about something subjective that does not exist.</p>
