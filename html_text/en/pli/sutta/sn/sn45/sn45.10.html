<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. Then the wanderer Nandiya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One: “How many things, Master Gotama, when developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbāna, have Nibbāna as their destination, Nibbāna as their final goal?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“These eight things, Nandiya, when developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbāna, have Nibbāna as their destination, Nibbāna as their final goal. What eight? Right view … right concentration. These eight things, when developed and cultivated, lead to Nibbāna, have Nibbāna as their destination, Nibbāna as their final goal.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>When this was said, the wanderer Nandiya said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.v.12'></a> Gotama!… From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
