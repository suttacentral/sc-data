<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, I do not see even one other thing by means of which the unarisen Noble Eightfold Path arises and the arisen Noble Eightfold Path goes to fulfilment by development so effectively as by this: accomplishment in virtue … accomplishment in desire … accomplishment in self … accomplishment in view … accomplishment in diligence … accomplishment in careful attention … <span class='pe'>complete as in §84</span> <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.v.38'></a> … He develops right concentration, which has as its final goal the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who is accomplished in careful attention develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.”</p>
