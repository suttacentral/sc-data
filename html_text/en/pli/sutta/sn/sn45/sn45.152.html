<h1>45.152. The Tree</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, suppose a tree were slanting, sloping, and inclining towards the east. If it were cut at its foot, in what direction would it fall?” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.v.48'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“In whatever direction it was slanting, sloping, and inclining, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“So too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“And how does a bhikkhu do so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view … right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”</p>
