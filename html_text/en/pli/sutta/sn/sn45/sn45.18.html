<h1>45.18. The Cock’s Park (1)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda and the Venerable Bhadda were dwelling at Paṭaliputta in the Cock’s Park. Then, in the evening, the Venerable Bhadda emerged from seclusion, approached the Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Ānanda:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Friend Ānanda, it is said, ‘the unholy life, the unholy life.’ What now, friend, is the unholy life?” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.v.16'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Good, good, friend Bhadda! Your intelligence is excellent, friend Bhadda, your ingenuity is excellent, your inquiry is a good one. For you have asked me: ‘Friend Ānanda, it is said, “the unholy life, the unholy life.” What now, friend, is the unholy life?’”</p>
<p>“Yes, friend.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“This eightfold wrong path, friend, is the unholy life; that is, wrong view … wrong concentration.”</p>
