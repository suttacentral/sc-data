<h1>45.149. Strenuous</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, just as whatever strenuous deeds are done, are all done based upon the earth, established upon the earth, <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.v.46'></a> so too, based upon virtue, established upon virtue, a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu, based upon virtue, established upon virtue, develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view … right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu, based upon virtue, established upon virtue, develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.”</p>
