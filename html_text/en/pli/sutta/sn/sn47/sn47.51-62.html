<h1>47.51–62. The River Ganges—Eastward, Etc.</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, just as the river Ganges slants, slopes, and inclines towards the east, so too a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the four establishments of mindfulness slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu develop and cultivate the four establishments of mindfulness so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the four establishments of mindfulness so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>(The remaining suttas of this vagga are to be similarly elaborated parallel to <a href='sn45.html#45.92'>45:92-102</a>.)</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>Six about slanting to the east<br>
And six about slanting to the ocean.<br>
These two sixes make up twelve:<br>
Thus the subchapter is recited.</p>
