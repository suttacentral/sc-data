<h1>55.3. Dīghāvu upāsaka</h1>

<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw1' href='#flw1'>FLW 1</a>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw2' href='#flw2'>FLW 2</a>Once the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Grove, at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw3' href='#flw3'>FLW 3</a>Now on that occasion Dīghāvu the lay-disciple was sick afflicted, suffering from a sore disease.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw4' href='#flw4'>FLW 4</a>Then Dīghāvu the lay-disciple called to his father Jotika the housefather, saying:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw5' href='#flw5'>FLW 5</a>“Come, housefather!</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw6' href='#flw6'>FLW 6</a>Do you go to the Exalted One, and on coming to him, with your head worship at the feet of the Exalted One, and say in my name:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw7' href='#flw7'>FLW 7</a>‘Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple is sick, afflicted, suffering from a sore disease.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw8' href='#flw8'>FLW 8</a>He worships with his head at the Exalted One's feet.’</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw9' href='#flw9'>FLW 9</a>Then say:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw10' href='#flw10'>FLW 10</a>‘It were a good thing, lord, if the Exalted One would come to the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, out of compassion for him.'”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw11' href='#flw11'>FLW 11</a>“Very good, my lad," said Jotika the housefather in reply to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, and went to the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw12' href='#flw12'>FLW 12</a>So seated, Jotika the housefather said this to the Exalted One:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw13' href='#flw13'>FLW 13</a>“Lord, Dīghāvu the lay-disciple is sick, afflicted, suffering from a sore disease.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw14' href='#flw14'>FLW 14</a>He worships with his head at the feet of the Exalted One and says thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw15' href='#flw15'>FLW 15</a>‘It were a good thing, lord, if the Exalted One would come to the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, out of compassion for him.'”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw16' href='#flw16'>FLW 16</a>And the Exalted One consented by his silence.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw17' href='#flw17'>FLW 17</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.350' href='#pts-vp-pli1.350'>PTS vp Pali 345</a>Thereupon the Exalted One robed himself, and taking bowl and outer robe set off for the house of Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, and on arriving there sat down on a seat made ready.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw18' href='#flw18'>FLW 18</a>Having sat down the Exalted One said this to Dīghāvu the lay-disciple:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw19' href='#flw19'>FLW 19</a>“Well, Dīghāvu, I hope you are bearing up, I hope you are enduring.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw20' href='#flw20'>FLW 20</a>Do your pains abate and not increase?</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw21' href='#flw21'>FLW 21</a>Are there signs of their abating and not increasing?”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw22' href='#flw22'>FLW 22</a>“No, lord!</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw23' href='#flw23'>FLW 23</a>I am not bearing up.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw24' href='#flw24'>FLW 24</a>I am not enduring.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw25' href='#flw25'>FLW 25</a>Strong pains come upon me.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw26' href='#flw26'>FLW 26</a>They do not abate.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw27' href='#flw27'>FLW 27</a>There is no sign of their abating but of their increasing.”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw28' href='#flw28'>FLW 28</a>“Then, Dīghāvu, thus must you train yourself:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw29' href='#flw29'>FLW 29</a>‘I will be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw30' href='#flw30'>FLW 30</a>He it is the Exalted One, Arahant, a fully Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and practice, a Happy One, world-knower, unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and mankind, a Buddha, an Exalted One.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw31' href='#flw31'>FLW 31</a>I will be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw32' href='#flw32'>FLW 32</a>Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm, seen in this very life, a thing not involving time, inviting one to come and see, leading onward, to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw33' href='#flw33'>FLW 33</a>I will be blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw34' href='#flw34'>FLW 34</a>Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order, walking uprightly, walking in the right way, walking dutifully is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples: namely, the four pairs of men, the eight sorts of men.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw35' href='#flw35'>FLW 35</a>That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw36' href='#flw36'>FLW 36</a>Worthy of honour are they, worthy of reverence, worthy of offerings, worthy of salutations with clasped hands,—a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw37' href='#flw37'>FLW 37</a>Also I will be blessed with the virtues dear to the Ariyans, virtues unbroken, whole, unspotted, untarnished, giving freedom, praised by the wise: virtues untainted (by craving or delusion), which lead to concentration of the mind.’</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw38' href='#flw38'>FLW 38</a>That, Dīghāvu, is how you must train yourself.”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw39' href='#flw39'>FLW 39</a>“As to these four limbs of stream-winning, lord, which have been taught by the Exalted One, all of those conditions are to be found in me, and I do live in accordance with them.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw40' href='#flw40'>FLW 40</a>Lord, I am indeed blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Buddha, thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw41' href='#flw41'>FLW 41</a>He it is the Exalted One, Arahant, a fully Enlightened One, perfect in knowledge and practice, a Happy One, world-knower, unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and mankind, a Buddha, an Exalted One.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw42' href='#flw42'>FLW 42</a>I am indeed blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Norm, thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw43' href='#flw43'>FLW 43</a>Well proclaimed by the Exalted One is the Norm, seen in this very life, a thing not involving time, inviting one to come and see, leading onward, to be known for themselves by the wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw44' href='#flw44'>FLW 44</a>I am indeed blessed with unwavering loyalty to the Order, thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw45' href='#flw45'>FLW 45</a>Walking righteously is the Exalted One's Order, walking uprightly, walking in the right way, walking dutifully is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples: namely, the four pairs of men, the eight sorts of men.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw46' href='#flw46'>FLW 46</a>That is the Exalted One's Order of Disciples.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw47' href='#flw47'>FLW 47</a>Worthy of honour are they, worthy of reverence, worthy of offerings, worthy of salutations with clasped hands,—a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw48' href='#flw48'>FLW 48</a>I am indeed blessed with the virtues dear to the Ariyans, virtues unbroken, whole, unspotted, untarnished, giving freedom, praised by the wise: virtues untainted (by craving or delusion), which lead to concentration of the mind.”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw49' href='#flw49'>FLW 49</a>“Therefore, Dīghāvu, resting on these four limbs of stream-winning, you should further practise the six conditions which are constituent parts of knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw50' href='#flw50'>FLW 50</a>Herein, Dīghāvu, do you dwell contemplating impermanence in all the activities, conscious of ill in impermanence, conscious of there being no self in what is ill, conscious of abandoning, of dispassion, of cessation.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw51' href='#flw51'>FLW 51</a>That, Dīghāvu, is how you must train yourself.”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw52' href='#flw52'>FLW 52</a>Lord, as to these same six conditions, which are constituent parts of knowledge, all of them are to be found in me.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw53' href='#flw53'>FLW 53</a>I do live contemplating impermanence in all the activities, conscious of ill in impermanence, conscious of there being no self in what is ill, conscious of abandoning, of dispassion, of cessation.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw54' href='#flw54'>FLW 54</a>Then, lord, I have this thought:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw55' href='#flw55'>FLW 55</a>‘I would not have the housefather Jotika here fall into dejection at my death.'”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw56' href='#flw56'>FLW 56</a>“Don't you trouble about that, Dīghāvu, my lad! (said his father).</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw57' href='#flw57'>FLW 57</a>Look you, Dīghāvu, my lad!</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw58' href='#flw58'>FLW 58</a>Attend closely to what the Exalted One is saying to you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw59' href='#flw59'>FLW 59</a>So the Exalted One, having thus admonished Dīghāvu the lay-disciple, rose from his seat and went away.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw60' href='#flw60'>FLW 60</a>And not long after the Exalted One had gone Dīghāvu the lay-disciple made an end.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw61' href='#flw61'>FLW 61</a>Thereupon a number of monks went to see the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw62' href='#flw62'>FLW 62</a>So seated those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw63' href='#flw63'>FLW 63</a>“Lord, that lay-disciple named Dīghāvu, who was admonished in brief by the Exalted One, has made an end.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw64' href='#flw64'>FLW 64</a>What is his lot?</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw65' href='#flw65'>FLW 65</a>What is his destiny in the life to come?”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw66' href='#flw66'>FLW 66</a>“A sage, monks, was Dīghāvu the lay-disciple.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw67' href='#flw67'>FLW 67</a>He lived according to the Norm.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw68' href='#flw68'>FLW 68</a>He did not harm me by disputings about the Norm.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw69' href='#flw69'>FLW 69</a>Dīghāvu, the lay-disciple, monks, by wearing out the five fetters of the lower sort, is reborn by spontaneous birth.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw70' href='#flw70'>FLW 70</a>His destiny is not to return from that world.”</p>
