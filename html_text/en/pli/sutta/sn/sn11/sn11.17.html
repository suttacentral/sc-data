<h1>11.17. Veneration of the Buddha</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī in Jeta’s Grove. Now on that occasion the Blessed One had gone for his day’s abiding and was in seclusion. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, and Brahma Sahampati approached the Blessed One and stood one at each doorpost. Then Sakka, lord of the devas, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a> “Rise up, O hero, victor in battle!<br>
Your burden lowered, debt-free one, wander in the world.<br>
Your mind is fully liberated<br>
Like the moon on the fifteenth night.” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.234'></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a><span class='speaker'>Brahma Sahampati:</span> “It is not in such a way that the Tathagatas are to be venerated, lord of the devas. The Tathagatas are to be venerated thus:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a> “Rise up, O hero, victor in battle!<br>
O caravan leader, debt-free one, wander in the world.<br>
Teach the Dhamma, O Blessed One:<br>
There will be those who will understand.”</p>
</blockquote>
