<p>“I have, Mahali.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Surely, venerable sir, that must have been one who looked like Sakka, lord of the devas; for Sakka, lord of the devas, is difficult to see.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“I know Sakka, Mahali, and I know the qualities that make for Sakka, by the undertaking of which Sakka achieved the status of Sakka.</p>
