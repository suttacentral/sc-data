<h1>22.55. Inspired Utterance</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthi. There the Blessed One uttered this inspired utterance: “‘It might not be, and it might not be for me; it will not be, <span class='add'>and</span> it will not be for me’: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.56' href='#sn.iii.56'>sn.iii.56</a> resolving thus, a bhikkhu can cut off the lower fetters.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: “But how, venerable sir, can a bhikkhu, resolving thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be for me; it will not be, <span class='add'>and</span> it will not be for me,’ cut off the lower fetters?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones … regards form as self … or self as in consciousness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“He does not understand as it really is impermanent form as ‘impermanent form’ … impermanent feeling as ‘impermanent feeling’ … impermanent perception as ‘impermanent perception’ … impermanent volitional formations as ‘impermanent volitional formations’ … impermanent consciousness as ‘impermanent consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“He does not understand as it really is painful form as ‘painful form’ … painful feeling as ‘painful feeling’ … painful perception as ‘painful perception’ … painful volitional formations as ‘painful volitional formations’ … painful consciousness as ‘painful consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“He does not understand as it really is selfless form as ‘selfless form’ … selfless feeling as ‘selfless feeling’ … selfless perception as ‘selfless perception’ … selfless volitional formations as ‘selfless volitional formations’ … selfless consciousness as ‘selfless consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“He does not understand as it really is conditioned form as ‘conditioned form’ … conditioned feeling as ‘conditioned feeling’ … conditioned perception as ‘conditioned perception’ … conditioned volitional formations as ‘conditioned volitional formations’ … conditioned consciousness as ‘conditioned consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“He does not understand as it really is: ‘Form will be exterminated’ … ‘Feeling will be exterminated’ … ‘Perception will be exterminated’ … ‘Volitional formations will be exterminated’ … ‘Consciousness will be exterminated.’ <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.57' href='#sn.iii.57'>sn.iii.57</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“The instructed noble disciple, bhikkhu, who is a seer of the noble ones … does not regard form as self … or self as in consciousness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“He understands as it really is impermanent form as ‘impermanent form’ … impermanent consciousness as ‘impermanent consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“He understands as it really is painful form as ‘painful form’ … painful consciousness as ‘painful consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“He understands as it really is selfless form as ‘selfless form’ … selfless consciousness as ‘selfless consciousness.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“He understands as it really is conditioned form as ‘conditioned form’ … conditioned consciousness as ‘conditioned consciousness. ’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“He understands as it really is: ‘Form will be exterminated’ … ‘Feeling will be exterminated’ … ‘Perception will be exterminated’ … ‘Volitional formations will be exterminated’ … ‘Consciousness will be exterminated.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“With the extermination of form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness, that bhikkhu, resolving thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be for me; it will not be, <span class='add'>and</span> it will not be for me,’ can cut off the lower fetters.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Resolving thus, venerable sir, a bhikkhu can cut off the lower fetters. But how should one know, how should one see, for the immediate destruction of the taints to occur?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Here, bhikkhu, the uninstructed worldling becomes frightened over an unfrightening matter. For this is frightening to the uninstructed worldling: ‘It might not be, and it might not be for me; it will not be, <span class='add'>and</span> it will not be for me.’ But the instructed noble disciple does not become frightened over an unfrightening matter. For this is not frightening to the noble disciple: ‘It might not be, and it might not be for me; it will not be, <span class='add'>and</span> it will not be for me.’ <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.58' href='#sn.iii.58'>sn.iii.58</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Consciousness, bhikkhu, while standing, might stand engaged with form … engaged with feeling … engaged with perception … engaged with volitional formations; based upon volitional formations, established upon volitional formations, with a sprinkling of delight, it might come to growth, increase, and expansion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“Bhikkhu, though someone might say: ‘Apart from form, apart from feeling, apart from perception, apart from volitional formations, I will make known the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and rebirth, its growth, increase, and expansion’—that is impossible.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“Bhikkhu, if a bhikkhu has abandoned lust for the form element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness. If he has abandoned lust for the feeling element … for the perception element … for the volitional formations element … for the consciousness element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“When that consciousness is unestablished, not coming to growth, nongenerative, it is liberated. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“It is, bhikkhu, for one who knows thus, for one who sees thus, that the immediate destruction of the taints occurs.”</p>
