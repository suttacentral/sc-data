<h1>22.7. Agitation through Clinging (1)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you agitation through clinging and nonagitation through nonclinging. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak.” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.16'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“And how, bhikkhus, is there agitation through clinging? Here, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. That form of his changes and alters. With the change and alteration of form, his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of form. Agitation and a constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is obsessed, he is frightened, distressed, and anxious, and through clinging he becomes agitated.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“He regards feeling as self … perception as self … volitional formations as self … consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That consciousness of his changes and alters. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.17'></a> With the change and alteration of consciousness, his consciousness becomes preoccupied with the change of consciousness. Agitation and a constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is obsessed, he is frightened, distressed, and anxious, and through clinging he becomes agitated.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that there is agitation through clinging.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“And how, bhikkhus, is there nonagitation through nonclinging? Here, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple, who is a seer of the noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who is a seer of superior persons and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. That form of his changes and alters. Despite the change and alteration of form, his consciousness does not become preoccupied with the change of form. No agitation and constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of form remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is not obsessed, he is not frightened, distressed, or anxious, and through nonclinging he does not become agitated.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“He does not regard feeling as self … perception as self … volitional formations as self … <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.18'></a> … consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That consciousness of his changes and alters. Despite the change and alteration of consciousness, his consciousness does not become preoccupied with the change of consciousness. No agitation and constellation of mental states born of preoccupation with the change of consciousness remain obsessing his mind. Because his mind is not obsessed, he is not frightened, distressed, or anxious, and through nonclinging he does not become agitated.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that there is nonagitation through nonclinging.”</p>
