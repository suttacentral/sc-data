<h1>22.23. Full Understanding</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.27'></a> “Bhikkhus, I will teach you things that should be fully understood and also full understanding. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And what, bhikkhus, are the things that should be fully understood? Form, bhikkhus, is something that should be fully understood; feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness is something that should be fully understood. These are called the things that should be fully understood.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is full understanding? The destruction of lust, the destruction of hatred, the destruction of delusion. This is called full understanding.”</p>
