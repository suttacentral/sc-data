<h1>22.52. Destruction of Delight (2)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.52'></a> “Bhikkhus, attend carefully to form. Recognize the impermanence of form as it really is. When a bhikkhu attends carefully to form and recognizes the impermanence of form as it really is, he experiences revulsion towards form. With the destruction of delight comes the destruction of lust; with the destruction of lust comes the destruction of delight. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is liberated and is said to be well liberated.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Bhikkhus, attend carefully to feeling … to perception … to volitional formations … to consciousness…. With the destruction of delight and lust the mind is liberated and is said to be well liberated.”</p>
