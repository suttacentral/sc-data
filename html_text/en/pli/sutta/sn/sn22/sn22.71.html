<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Radha approached the Blessed One, <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.80'></a> paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see so that, in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Any kind of form whatsoever, Radha, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—one sees all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—one sees all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“When one knows and sees thus, Radha, then in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit no longer occur within.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>Then the Venerable Radha … became one of the arahants.</p>
