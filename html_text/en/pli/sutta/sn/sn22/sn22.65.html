<h1>22.65. In Seeking Delight</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief….”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Bhikkhu, in seeking delight one is bound by Mara; by not seeking delight one is freed from the Evil One.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Fortunate One!”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“In seeking delight in form, venerable sir, one is bound by Mara; by not seeking delight in it one is freed from the Evil One. In seeking delight in feeling … in perception … in volitional formations … in consciousness one is bound by Mara; by not seeking delight in it one is freed from the Evil One. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.76'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“It is in such a way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief. In seeking delight in form, bhikkhu, one is bound by Mara … <span class='pe'>as above in full</span> … by not seeking delight in it one is freed from the Evil One. It is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood in detail.”</p>
<p>… And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.</p>
