<h1>22.35. A Certain Bhikkhu (1)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.35'></a> Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Bhikkhu, if one has an underlying tendency towards something, then one is reckoned in terms of it. If one does not have an underlying tendency towards something, then one is not reckoned in terms of it.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Understood, Blessed One! Understood, Fortunate One!”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“In what way, bhikkhu, do you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“If, venerable sir, one has an underlying tendency towards form, then one is reckoned in terms of it. If one has an underlying tendency towards feeling, then one is reckoned in terms of it. If one has an underlying tendency towards perception, then one is reckoned in terms of it. If one has an underlying tendency towards volitional formations, then one is reckoned in terms of them. If one has an underlying tendency towards consciousness, then one is reckoned in terms of it.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“If, venerable sir, one does not have an underlying tendency towards form, then one is not reckoned in terms of it. If one does not have an underlying tendency towards feeling … towards perception … towards volitional formations … towards consciousness, then one is not reckoned in terms of it.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“It is in such a way, venerable sir, that I understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you understand in detail the meaning of what was stated by me in brief. If, bhikkhu, one has an underlying tendency towards form … <span class='pe'>as above in full</span> … then one is not reckoned in terms of it. It is in such a way that the meaning of what was stated by me in brief should be understood in detail.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a>Then that bhikkhu, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s statement, <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.36'></a> rose from his seat, and, after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he departed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a>Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, that bhikkhu, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life entered and dwelt in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. He directly knew: “Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.” And that bhikkhu became one of the arahants.</p>
