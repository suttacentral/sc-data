<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Venerable sir, it is said, ‘cessation, cessation.’ Through the cessation of what things is cessation spoken of?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Form, Ānanda, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, to vanishing, to fading away, to cessation. Through its cessation, cessation is spoken of.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Feeling is impermanent … Perception is impermanent … Volitional formations are impermanent … <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iii.25'></a> … Consciousness is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, to vanishing, to fading away, to cessation. Through its cessation, cessation is spoken of.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“It is through the cessation of these things, Ānanda, that cessation is spoken of.”</p>
