<h1>44.10. Ānanda <span class='add'>Is There a Self?</span></h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p>“How is it now, Master Gotama, is there a self?”</p>
<p>When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.</p>
<p>“Then, Master Gotama, is there no self?”</p>
<p>A second time the Blessed One was silent.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then the wanderer Vacchagotta rose from his seat and departed.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>Then, not long after the wanderer Vacchagotta had left, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One: “Why is it, venerable sir, that when the Blessed One was questioned by the wanderer Vacchagotta, he did not answer?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“If, Ānanda, when I was asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta, ‘Is there a self?’ I had answered, ‘There is a self,’ this would have been siding with those ascetics and brahmins who are eternalists. And if, when I was asked by him, ‘Is there no self?’ I had answered, ‘There is no self,’ <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.401'></a> this would have been siding with those ascetics and brahmins who are annihilationists.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“If, Ānanda, when I was asked by the wanderer Vacchagotta, ‘Is there a self?’ I had answered, ‘There is a self,’ would this have been consistent on my part with the arising of the knowledge that ‘all phenomena are nonself’?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“And if, when I was asked by him, ‘Is there no self?’ I had answered, ‘There is no self,’ the wanderer Vacchagotta, already confused, would have fallen into even greater confusion, thinking, ‘It seems that the self I formerly had does not exist now.’”</p>
