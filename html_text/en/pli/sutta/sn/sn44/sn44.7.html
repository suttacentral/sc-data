<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“How is it, Master Moggallana, is the world eternal?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The world is eternal.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Then, Master Moggallana, is the world not eternal?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The world is not eternal.’”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The world is finite.’”</p>
<p>“Then, Master Moggallana, is the world infinite?”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“How is it then, Master Moggallana, are the soul and the body the same?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The soul and the body are the same.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Then, Master Moggallana, is the soul one thing, the body another?”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21'>SC 21</a>“What, Master Moggallana, is the cause and reason why, when wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ‘The world is eternal’ or ‘The world is not eternal’; or ‘The world is finite’ or ‘The world is infinite’; or ‘The soul and the body are the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body is another’; or ‘The Tathagata exists after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death’? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.393' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“What, Master Moggallana, is the cause and reason why, when wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ‘The world is eternal’ or ‘The world is not eternal’; or ‘The world is finite’ or ‘The world is infinite’; or ‘The soul and the body are the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body is another’; or ‘The Tathagata exists after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death’? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.393'>sn.iv.393</a>  And what is the cause and reason why, when the ascetic Gotama is asked such questions, he does not give such answers?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“Vaccha, wanderers of other sects regard the eye thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ They regard the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ Therefore, when the wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ‘The world is eternal’ … or ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ But, Vaccha, the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, regards the eye thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ He regards the ear … the mind thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Therefore, when the Tathagata is asked such questions, he does not give such answers.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>Then the wanderer Vacchagotta rose from his seat and approached the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One …and said to him:</p>
