<h1>1.11. Nandana</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Once in the past, bhikkhus, a certain devatā of the Tavatiṃsa host was revelling in Nandana Grove, supplied and endowed with the five cords of celestial sensual pleasure, accompanied by a retinue of celestial nymphs. On that occasion he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a> “‘They do not know bliss<br>
Who have not seen Nandana,<br>
The abode of the glorious male devas<br>
Belonging to the host of Thirty.’ <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.6'></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“When this was said, bhikkhus, a certain devatā replied to that devatā in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “‘Don’t you know, you fool,<br>
That maxim of the arahants?<br>
Impermanent are all formations;<br>
Their nature is to arise and vanish.<br>
Having arisen, they cease:<br>
Their appeasement is blissful.’”</p>
