<h1>1.31. With the Good</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a number of devatās belonging to the Satullapa host, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.17'>sn.i.17</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2'>SC 2</a>Then one devatā, standing to one side, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3'>SC 3</a> “One should associate only with the good;<br>
With the good one should foster intimacy.<br>
Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,<br>
One becomes better, never worse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4'>SC 4</a>Then five other devatās in turn recited their verses in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5'>SC 5</a> “One should associate only with the good;<br>
With the good one should foster intimacy.<br>
Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,<br>
Wisdom is gained, but not from another.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6'>SC 6</a> “One should associate only with the good;<br>
With the good one should foster intimacy.<br>
Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,<br>
One does not sorrow in the midst of sorrow.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7'>SC 7</a> “One should associate only with the good;<br>
With the good one should foster intimacy.<br>
Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,<br>
One shines amidst one’s relations.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8'>SC 8</a> “One should associate only with the good;<br>
With the good one should foster intimacy.<br>
Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,<br>
Beings fare on to a good destination.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9'>SC 9</a> “One should associate only with the good;<br>
With the good one should foster intimacy.<br>
Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,<br>
Beings abide comfortably.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10'>SC 10</a>Then another devatā said to the Blessed One: “Which one, Blessed One, has spoken well?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11'>SC 11</a>“You have all spoken well in a way. But listen to me too: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.18'>sn.i.18</a> </p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12'>SC 12</a> “One should associate only with the good;<br>
With the good one should foster intimacy.<br>
Having learnt the true Dhamma of the good,<br>
One is released from all suffering.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13'>SC 13</a>This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those devatās paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, they disappeared right there.</p>
