<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a> “Resounding with a host of nymphs,<br>
Haunted by a host of demons!<br>
This grove is to be called ‘Deluding’:<br>
How does one escape from it?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a> “‘The straight way’ that path is called,<br>
And ‘fearless’ is its destination.<br>
The chariot is called ‘unrattling,’<br>
Fitted with wheels of wholesome states.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a> “The sense of shame is its leaning board,<br>
Mindfulness its upholstery;<br>
I call the Dhamma the charioteer,<br>
With right view running out in front.</p>

Whether a woman or a man—<br>
Has, by means of this vehicle,<br>
Drawn close to Nibbāna.”</p>
