<h1>1.28. Those of Great Wealth</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a> “Those of great wealth and property,<br>
Even khattiyas who rule the country,<br>
Look at each other with greedy eyes,<br>
Insatiable in sensual pleasures.<br>
72 Among these who have become so avid,<br>
Flowing along in the stream of existence,<br>
Who here have abandoned craving?<br>
Who in the world are no longer avid?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a> “Having left their homes and gone forth,<br>
Having left their dear sons and cattle,<br>
Having left behind lust and hatred,<br>
Having expunged ignorance—<br>
The arahants with taints destroyed<br>
Are those in the world no longer avid.” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.16'></a></p>
