<h1>1.36. Faith</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a number of devatās belonging to the Satullapa host, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then one devatā, standing to one side, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a> “Faith is a person’s partner;<br>
If lack of faith does not persist,<br>
Fame and renown thereby come to him,<br>
And he goes to heaven on leaving the body.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>Then another devatā recited these verses in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a> “One should discard anger, cast off conceit,<br>
Transcend all the fetters.<br>
No ties torment one who has nothing,<br>
Who does not adhere to name-and-form.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>Another devatā:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “Foolish people devoid of wisdom<br>
Devote themselves to negligence.<br>
But the wise man guards diligence<br>
As his foremost treasure.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a> “Do not yield to negligence,<br>
Don’t be intimate with sensual delight.<br>
For the diligent ones, meditating,<br>
Attain supreme happiness.” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.26'></a></p>
</blockquote>
