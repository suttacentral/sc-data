<p><span class='speaker'>The devatā Ghaṭikara:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a> “Seven bhikkhus reborn in Aviha<br>
Have been fully liberated.<br>
With lust and hatred utterly destroyed,<br>
They have crossed over attachment to the world.”</p>

<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a> “And who are those who crossed the swamp,<br>
The realm of Death so hard to cross?<br>
Who, having left the human body,<br>
Have overcome the celestial bond?”</p>

<p><span class='speaker'>Ghaṭikara:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a> “Upaka and Palagaṇḍa,<br>
With Pukkusati—these are three.<br>
Then Bhaddiya and Bhaddadeva,<br>
And Bahudanti and Piṅgiya.<br>
These, having left the human body,<br>
Have overcome the celestial bond.”</p>

<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a> “Good is the word you speak of them,<br>
Of those who have abandoned Mara’s snares.<br>
Whose Dhamma was it that they understood<br>
Whereby they cut through the bondage of existence?”</p>

<p><span class='speaker'>Ghaṭikara:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a> “It was not apart from the Blessed One!<br>
It was not apart from your Teaching!<br>
By having understood your Dhamma<br>
They cut through the bondage of existence.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “Where name-and-form ceases,<br>
Stops without remainder:<br>
By understanding that Dhamma here<br>
They cut through the bondage of existence.”</p>

<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a> “Deep is the speech you utter,<br>
Hard to understand, very hard to grasp.<br>
Having understood whose Dhamma<br>
Do you utter such speech?”</p>

<p><span class='speaker'>Ghaṭikara:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a> “In the past I was the potter,<br>
Ghaṭikara in Vehaḷiṅga.<br>
I supported my mother and father then<br>
As a lay follower of the Buddha Kassapa. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.36'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a> “I abstained from sexual intercourse,<br>
I was celibate, free from carnal ties.<br>
I was your fellow villager,<br>
In the past I was your friend.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a> “I am the one who knows<br>
These seven liberated bhikkhus,<br>
Who with lust and hatred utterly destroyed<br>
Have crossed over attachment to the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a> “Just so it was at that time,<br>
As you say, O Bhaggava:<br>
In the past you were the potter,<br>
Ghaṭikara in Vehaḷiṅga.<br>
You supported your mother and father then<br>
As a lay follower of the Buddha Kassapa.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a> “You abstained from sexual intercourse,<br>
You were celibate, free from carnal ties.<br>
You were my fellow villager,<br>
In the past you were my friend.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a> Such was the meeting that took place<br>
Between those friends from the past,<br>
Both now inwardly developed,<br>
Bearers of their final bodies.</p>
