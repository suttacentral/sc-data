<h1>1.33. Good</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. Then, when the night had advanced, a number of devatās belonging to the Satullapa host, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then one devatā, standing to one side, uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“Good is giving, dear sir!</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a> “Through stinginess and negligence<br>
A gift is not given.<br>
One who knows, desiring merit,<br>
Should surely give a gift.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>Then another devatā uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<p>“Good is giving, dear sir!</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>And further:<br>
Even when there’s little, giving is good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “Some provide from what little they have,<br>
Others who are affluent don’t like to give.<br>
An offering given from what little one has<br>
Is worth a thousand times its value.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>Then another devatā uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>“Good is giving, dear sir!<br>
Even when there’s little, giving is good.<br>
And further:<br>
When done with faith too, giving is good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a> “Giving and warfare are similar, they say:<br>
A few good ones conquer many.<br>
If one with faith gives even a little,<br>
He thereby becomes happy in the other world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a>Then another devatā uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a>“Good is giving, dear sir!<br>
Even when there’s little, giving is good. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.21'></a><br>
When done with faith too, giving is good.<br>
And further:<br>
The gift of a righteous gain is also good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a> “When he gives a gift of a righteous gain<br>
Obtained by exertion and energy,<br>
Having passed over Yama’s Vetaraṇi River,<br>
That mortal arrives at celestial states.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a>Then another devatā uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc14'></a>“Good is giving, dear sir!<br>
Even when there’s little, giving is good.<br>
When done with faith too, giving is good;<br>
The gift of a righteous gain is also good.<br>
And further:<br>
Giving discriminately too is good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc15'></a> “Giving discriminately is praised by the Fortunate One—<br>
To those worthy of offerings<br>
Here in the world of the living.<br>
What is given to them bears great fruit<br>
Like seeds sown in a fertile field.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc16'></a>Then another devatā uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc17'></a>“Good is giving, dear sir!<br>
Even when there’s little, giving is good.<br>
When done with faith too, giving is good;<br>
The gift of a righteous gain is also good.<br>
Giving with discretion too is good.<br>
And further:<br>
Restraint towards living beings is also good.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc18'></a> “One who fares harming no living beings<br>
Does no evil from fear of others’ censure.<br>
In that they praise the timid, not the brave,<br>
For out of fear the good do no evil.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc19'></a>Then another devatā said to the Blessed One: <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.22'></a> “Which one, Blessed One, has spoken well?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc20'></a>“You have all spoken well in a way. But listen to me too:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc21'></a> “Surely giving is praised in many ways,<br>
But the path of Dhamma surpasses giving.<br>
For in the past and even long ago,<br>
The good and wise ones attained Nibbāna.”</p>
