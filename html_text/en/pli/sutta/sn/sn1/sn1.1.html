<h1>1.1. Crossing the Flood</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a certain devatā of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, stood to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p>“How, dear sir, did you cross the flood?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“By not halting, friend, and by not straining I crossed the flood.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“But how is it, dear sir, that by not halting and by not straining you crossed the flood?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“When I came to a standstill, friend, then I sank; but when I struggled, then I got swept away. It is in this way, friend, that by not halting and by not straining I crossed the flood.”</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>The devatā:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a> “After a long time at last I see<br>
A brahmin who is fully quenched,<br>
Who by not halting, not straining,<br>
Has crossed over attachment to the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6'>SC 6</a>This is what that devatā said. The Teacher approved. Then that devatā, thinking, “The Teacher has approved of me,” paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on the right, disappeared right there. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.2' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>This is what that devatā said.
