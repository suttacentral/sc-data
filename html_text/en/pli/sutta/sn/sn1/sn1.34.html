<h1>1.34. There Are No</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Then, when the night had advanced, a number of devatās belonging to the Satullapa host, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then one devatā, standing to one side, recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“There are among humans<br>
No permanent sensual pleasures;<br>
Here there are just desirable things.<br>
When a person is bound to these,<br>
Heedless in their midst,<br>
From Death’s realm he does not reach<br>
The state of no-more-coming-back.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a><span class='speaker'>Another devatā:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Misery is born of desire;<br>
suffering is born of desire.<br>
By the removal of desire,<br>
misery is removed;<br>
by the removal of misery,<br>
suffering is removed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a> “They are not sense pleasures, the world’s pretty things:<br>
Man’s sensuality is the intention of lust.<br>
The pretty things remain as they are in the world<br>
But the wise remove the desire for them. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.23'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “One should discard anger, cast off conceit,<br>
Transcend all the fetters.<br>
No sufferings torment one who has nothing,<br>
Who does not adhere to name-and-form.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a> “He abandoned reckoning, did not assume conceit;<br>
He cut off craving here for name-and-form.<br>
Though devas and humans search for him<br>
Here and beyond, in the heavens and all abodes,<br>
They do not find the one whose knots are cut,<br>
The one untroubled, free of longing.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a> “If devas and humans have not seen<br>
The one thus liberated here or beyond,”<br>
<span class='add'>said the Venerable Mogharaja</span>,<br>
“Are they to be praised who venerate him,<br>
The best of men, faring for the good of humans?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a> “Those bhikkhus too become worthy of praise,<br>
<span class='add'>Mogharaja,” said the Blessed One,</span><br>
“Who venerate him, the one thus liberated.<br>
But having known Dhamma and abandoned doubt,<br>
Those bhikkhus become even surmounters of ties.”</p>
