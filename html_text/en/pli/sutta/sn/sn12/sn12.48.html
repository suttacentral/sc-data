<h1>12.48. A Cosmologist</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. Then a brahmin who was a cosmologist approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p>“How is it, Master Gotama: does all exist?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“‘All exists’: this, brahmin, is the oldest cosmology.”</p>
<p>“Then, Master Gotama, does all not exist?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“‘All does not exist’: this, brahmin, is the second cosmology.”</p>
<p>“How is it, Master Gotama: is all a unity?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“‘All is a unity’: this, brahmin, is the third cosmology.”</p>
<p>“Then, Master Gotama, is all a plurality?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“‘All is a plurality’: this, brahmin, is the fourth cosmology. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle….”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>When this was said, that brahmin said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama!… From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
