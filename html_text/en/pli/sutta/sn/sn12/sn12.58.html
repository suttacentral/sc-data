<h1>12.58. Name-and-Form</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, there is a descent of name-and-form. With name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases <span class='add'>come to be</span>…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree, and all its roots going downwards and across would send the sap upwards. Sustained by that sap, nourished by it, that great tree would stand for a very long time. So too, when one lives contemplating gratification in things that can fetter, there is a descent of name-and-form…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“When, bhikkhus, one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, there is no descent of name-and-form. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.91'></a> With the cessation of name-and-form comes cessation of the six sense bases…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a great tree. Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket. He would cut down the tree at its foot … he would winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. Thus that great tree would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“So too, bhikkhus, when one dwells contemplating danger in things that can fetter, there is no descent of name-and-form…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”</p>
