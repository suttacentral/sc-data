<h1>12.45. At Ñatika</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Ñatika in the Brick Hall. Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, he uttered this Dhamma exposition: “In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class='add'>comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“In dependence on the ear and sounds … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class='add'>comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class='add'>comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.75'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“In dependence on the ear and sounds … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition, feeling <span class='add'>comes to be</span>; with feeling as condition, craving. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>Now on that occasion a certain bhikkhu was standing listening in on the Blessed One. The Blessed One saw him standing there listening in and said to him: “Did you hear that Dhamma exposition, bhikkhu?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“Learn that Dhamma exposition, bhikkhu, master it and remember it. That Dhamma exposition is beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the holy life.”</p>
