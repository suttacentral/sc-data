<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. “Herein, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. He understands birth … existence … clinging <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.44'></a> … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense bases … name-and-form … consciousness … volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is aging-and-death?… <span class='pe'>as in preceding sutta</span> … Just this Noble Eightfold Path is the way leading to the cessation of volitional formations; that is, right view … right concentration.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu thus understands aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; when he thus understands birth … existence … clinging … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense bases … name-and-form … <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.45'></a> consciousness … volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation, he is then called a bhikkhu who is accomplished in view, accomplished in vision, who has arrived at this true Dhamma, who sees this true Dhamma, who possesses a trainee’s knowledge, a trainee’s true knowledge, who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who stands squarely before the door to the Deathless.”</p>
