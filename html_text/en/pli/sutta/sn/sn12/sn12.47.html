<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. Then the brahmin Jaṇussoṇi approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>
<p>“How is it, Master Gotama: does all exist?”</p>
<p>“‘All exists’: this, brahmin, is one extreme.”</p>
<p>“Then, Master Gotama, does all not exist?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“‘All does not exist’: this, brahmin, is the second extreme. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma by the middle….”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>When this was said, the brahmin Jaṇussoṇi said to the Blessed One: <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.77'></a> “Magnificent, Master Gotama!… From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
