<h1>12.37. Not Yours</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, this body is not yours, nor does it belong to others. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.65'></a> It is old kamma, to be seen as generated and fashioned by volition, as something to be felt. Therein, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple attends carefully and closely to dependent origination itself thus: ‘When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases. That is, with ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class='add'>come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”</p>
