<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, one who does not know and see as it really is aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation, should search for a teacher in order to know this as it really is. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.131'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Bhikkhus, one who does not know and see as it really is birth … existence … clinging … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense bases … name-and-form … consciousness … volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation, should search for a teacher in order to know this as it really is.”</p>
