<h1>5.8. Sisupacala</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a> At Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Sisupacala dressed … she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the bhikkhuni Sisupacala and said to her: “Whose creed do you approve of, bhikkhuni?”</p>
<p>“I don’t approve of anyone’s creed, friend.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a> “Under whom have you shaved your head?<br>
You do appear to be an ascetic,<br>
Yet you don’t approve of any creed,<br>
So why wander as if bewildered?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>The bhikkhuni Sisupacala:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a> “Outside here the followers of creeds<br>
Place their confidence in views.<br>
I don’t approve of their teachings;<br>
They are not skilled in the Dhamma. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.134'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a> “But there’s one born in the Sakyan clan,<br>
The Enlightened One, without an equal,<br>
Conqueror of all, Mara’s subduer,<br>
Who everywhere is undefeated,<br>
Everywhere freed and unattached,<br>
The One with Vision who sees all.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “Attained to the end of all kamma,<br>
Liberated in the extinction of acquisitions,<br>
That Blessed One is my Teacher:<br>
His is the teaching I approve.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhuni Sisupacala knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.</p>
