<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. Then, in the morning, the bhikkhuni Kisagotami dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Savatthi for alms. When she had walked for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round, <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.130'></a> after her meal she went to the Blind Men’s Grove for the day’s abiding. Having plunged into the Blind Men’s Grove, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s abiding.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then Mara the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the bhikkhuni Kisagotami, desiring to make her fall away from concentration, approached her and addressed her in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a> “Why now, when your son is dead,<br>
Do you sit alone with tearful face?<br>
Having entered the woods all alone,<br>
Are you on the lookout for a man?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>Then it occurred to the bhikkhuni Kisagotami: “Now who is this that recited the verse—a human being or a nonhuman being?” Then it occurred to her: “This is Mara the Evil One, who has recited the verse desiring to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in me, desiring to make me fall away from concentration.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>Then the bhikkhuni Kisagotami, having understood, “This is Mara the Evil One,” replied to him in verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “I’ve gotten past the death of sons;<br>
With this, the search for men has ended.<br>
I do not sorrow, I do not weep,<br>
Nor do I fear you, friend .</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a> “Delight everywhere has been destroyed,<br>
The mass of darkness has been sundered.<br>
Having conquered the army of Death,<br>
I dwell without defiling taints.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhuni Kisagotami knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.</p>
