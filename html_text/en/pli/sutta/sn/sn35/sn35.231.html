<h1>35.231. The Milk-Sap Tree</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, in regard to forms cognizable by the eye, if in any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.160'></a> lust still exists and has not been abandoned, if hatred still exists and has not been abandoned, if delusion still exists and has not been abandoned, then even trifling forms that enter into range of the eye obsess the mind, not to speak of those that are prominent. For what reason? Because lust still exists and has not been abandoned, hatred still exists and has not been abandoned, delusion still exists and has not been abandoned. The same in regard to sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a milk-sap tree —an assattha or a banyan or a pilakkha or an udumbara-fresh, young, tender. If a man breaks it here and there with a sharp axe, would sap come out?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Yes, venerable sir. For what reason? Because there is sap.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“So too, bhikkhus, in regard to forms cognizable by the eye … even trifling forms that enter into range of the eye obsess the mind, not to speak of those that are prominent. For what reason? Because lust still exists and has not been abandoned, hatred still <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.161'></a> exists and has not been abandoned, delusion still exists and has not been abandoned. The same in regard to sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Bhikkhus, in regard to forms cognizable by the eye, if in any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī lust does not exist and has been abandoned, if hatred does not exist and has been abandoned, if delusion does not exist and has been abandoned, then even prominent forms that enter into range of the eye do not obsess the mind, not to speak of those that are trifling. For what reason? Because lust does not exist and has been abandoned, hatred does not exist and has been abandoned, delusion does not exist and has been abandoned. The same in regard to sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a milk-sap tree—an assattha or a banyan or a pilakkha or an udumbara—dried up, desiccated, past its prime. If a man breaks it here and there with a sharp axe, would sap come out?” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.162'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“No, venerable sir. For what reason? Because there is no sap.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>“So too, bhikkhus, in regard to forms cognizable by the eye … even prominent forms that enter into range of the eye do not obsess the mind, not to speak of those that are trifling. For what reason? Because lust does not exist and has been abandoned, hatred does not exist and has been abandoned, delusion does not exist and has been abandoned. The same in regard to sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind.”</p>
