<h1>35.76. Radha (1)</h1>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>Then the Venerable Radha approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Radha, you should abandon desire for whatever is impermanent. And what is impermanent? The eye is impermanent; you should abandon desire for it. Forms are impermanent … Eye-consciousness is impermanent … Eye-contact is impermanent … Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is impermanent; you should abandon desire for it.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“The ear … The mind is impermanent … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is impermanent; you should abandon desire for it. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.49'></a> Radha, you should abandon desire for whatever is impermanent.”</p>
