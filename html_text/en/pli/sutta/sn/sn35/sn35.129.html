<h1>35.129. Ghosita</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then the householder Ghosita approached the Venerable Ānanda … and said to him: <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.114'></a> “Venerable Ānanda, it is said, ‘diversity of elements, diversity of elements.’ In what way, venerable sir, has the diversity of elements been spoken of by the Blessed One?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Householder, there exists the eye element, and forms that are agreeable, and eye-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasant, a pleasant feeling arises. There exists the eye element, and forms that are disagreeable, and eye-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as painful, a painful feeling arises. There exists the eye element, and forms that are a basis for equanimity, and eye-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, a neither- painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Householder, there exists the ear element … the nose element … the tongue element … the body element … the mind element, and mental phenomena that are agreeable, and mind-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasant, a pleasant feeling arises. There exists the mind element, and mental phenomena that are disagreeable, and mind-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as painful, a painful feeling arises. There exists the mind element, and mental phenomena that are a basis for equanimity, and mind-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“It is in this way, householder, that the diversity of elements has been spoken of by the Blessed One.” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.115'></a></p>
