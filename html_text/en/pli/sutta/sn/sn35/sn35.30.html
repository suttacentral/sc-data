<h1>35.30. Appropriate for Uprooting</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.22'></a> Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak….</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu does not conceive the eye, does not conceive in the eye, does not conceive from the eye, does not conceive, ‘The eye is mine.’ He does not conceive forms … eye-consciousness … eye-contact … and as to whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“He does not conceive the ear … He does not conceive the mind … mental phenomena … mind-consciousness … mind-contact … <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.23'></a> and as to whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … he does not conceive that, does not conceive in that, does not conceive from that, does not conceive, ‘That is mine.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“He does not conceive all, does not conceive in all, does not conceive from all, does not conceive, ‘All is mine.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Since he does not conceive anything thus, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“This, bhikkhus, is the way that is appropriate for uprooting all conceivings.”</p>
