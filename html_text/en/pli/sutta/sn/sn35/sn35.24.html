<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the Dhamma for abandoning all. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all? The eye is to be abandoned, forms are to be abandoned, eye-consciousness is to be abandoned, eye-contact is to be abandoned, <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.16'></a> and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“The ear is to be abandoned … The mind is to be abandoned, mental phenomena are to be abandoned, mind-consciousness is to be abandoned, mind-contact is to be abandoned, and whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is to be abandoned.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“This, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma for abandoning all.”</p>
