<h1>35.23. The All</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the all. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the all? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odours, the tongue and tastes, the body and tactile objects, the mind and mental phenomena. This is called the all.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“If anyone, bhikkhus, should speak thus: ‘Having rejected this all, I shall make known another all’—that would be a mere empty boast on his part. If he were questioned he would not be able to reply and, further, he would meet with vexation. For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, that would not be within his domain.”</p>
