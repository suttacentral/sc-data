<h1>35.242. The Simile of the Great Log (2)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kimbila on the bank of the river Ganges. The Blessed One saw a great log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges, and he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Do you see, bhikkhus, <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.182'></a> that great log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”… <span class='pe'>as above</span> …</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>When this was said, the Venerable Kimbila asked the Blessed One: “What, venerable sir, is the near shore … what is inward rottenness?”</p>
<p><span class='add'>Replies as above except the following:</span></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“And what, Kimbila, is inward rottenness? Here, Kimbila, a bhikkhu commits a certain defiled offence, an offence of a kind that does not allow for rehabilitation. This is called inward rottenness.”</p>
