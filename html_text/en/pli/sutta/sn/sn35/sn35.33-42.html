<h2>35.33. Subject to Birth</h2>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, all is subject to birth. And what, bhikkhus, is the all that is subject to birth? <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.27'></a> The eye is subject to birth. Forms … Eye-consciousness … Eye-contact … Whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition … that too is subject to birth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“The ear … The tongue … The body … The mind … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is subject to birth.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
