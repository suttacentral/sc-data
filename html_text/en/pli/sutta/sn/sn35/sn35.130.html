<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Venerable Mahakaccana was dwelling among the people of Avanti on Mount Papata at Kuraraghara. Then the householder Haliddakani approached the Venerable Mahakaccana … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Venerable sir, it was said by the Blessed One: ‘It is in dependence on the diversity of elements that there arises the diversity of contacts; in dependence on the diversity of contacts that there arises the diversity of feelings.’ How is this so, venerable sir?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Here, householder, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu understands an agreeable one thus: ‘Such it is!’ There is eye-consciousness, and in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasant there arises a pleasant feeling. Then, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu understands a disagreeable one thus: ‘Such it is!’ There is eye-consciousness, and in dependence on a contact to be experienced as painful there arises a painful feeling. Then, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu understands one that is a basis for equanimity thus: ‘Such it is!’ There is eye-consciousness, and in dependence on a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant there arises a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Further, householder, having heard a sound with the ear … having smelt an odour with the nose … having savoured a taste with the tongue … having felt a tactile object with the body … having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, a bhikkhu understands an agreeable one thus … <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.116'></a> … a disagreeable one thus … one that is a basis for equanimity thus: ‘Such it is!’ There is mind-consciousness, and in dependence on a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant there arises a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“It is in this way, householder, that in dependence on the diversity of elements there arises the diversity of contacts, and in dependence on the diversity of contacts there arises the diversity of feelings.”</p>
