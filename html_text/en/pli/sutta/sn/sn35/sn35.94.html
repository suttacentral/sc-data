<h1>35.94. Untamed, Unguarded</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, these six bases for contact—if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained—are bringers of suffering. What six?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“The eye, bhikkhus, as a base for contact—if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained—is a bringer of suffering. The ear as a base for contact … The mind as a base for contact … is a bringer of suffering. These six bases for contact—if untamed, unguarded, unprotected, unrestrained—are bringers of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Bhikkhus, these six bases for contact—if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained—are bringers of happiness. What six?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“The eye, bhikkhus, as a base for contact—if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained—is a bringer of happiness. The ear as a base for contact … The mind as a base for contact … is a bringer of happiness. These six bases for contact—if well tamed, well guarded, well protected, well restrained—are bringers of happiness.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“Just six, O bhikkhus, are the bases for contact,<br>
Where one unrestrained meets with suffering.<br>
Those who know how to restrain them<br>
Dwell uncorrupted, with faith their partner.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“Having seen forms that delight the mind<br>
And having seen those that give no delight,<br>
Dispel the path of lust towards the delightful<br>
And do not soil the mind by thinking,<br>
‘<span class='add'>The other</span> is displeasing to me.’ <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.71'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>“Having heard sounds both pleasant and raucous,<br>
Do not be enthralled with pleasant sound.<br>
Dispel the course of hate towards the raucous,<br>
And do not soil the mind by thinking,<br>
‘<span class='add'>This one</span> is displeasing to me.’</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc9'></a>“Having smelt a fragrant, delightful scent,<br>
And having smelt a putrid stench,<br>
Dispel aversion towards the stench<br>
And do not yield to desire for the lovely.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc10'></a>“Having enjoyed a sweet delicious taste,<br>
And having sometimes tasted what is bitter,<br>
Do not greedily enjoy the sweet taste,<br>
Do not feel aversion towards the bitter.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc11'></a>“When touched by pleasant contact do not be enthralled,<br>
Do not tremble when touched by pain.<br>
Look evenly on both the pleasant and painful,<br>
Not drawn or repelled by anything.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc12'></a>“When common people of proliferated perception<br>
Perceive and proliferate they become engaged.<br>
Having dispelled every mind-state bound to the home life,<br>
One travels on the road of renunciation.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc13'></a>“When the mind is thus well developed in six,<br>
If touched, one’s mind never flutters anywhere.<br>
Having vanquished both lust and hate, O bhikkhus,<br>
Go to the far shore beyond birth and death!” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.iv.72'></a></p>
