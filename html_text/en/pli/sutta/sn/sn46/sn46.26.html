<h1>46.26. The Destruction of Craving</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>“Bhikkhus, develop the path and the way that leads to the destruction of craving. And what is the path and the way that leads to the destruction of craving? It is: the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>When this was said, the Venerable Udayī asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how are the seven factors of enlightenment developed and cultivated so that they lead to the destruction of craving?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Here, Udayī, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, measureless, without ill will. When he develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion … without ill will, craving is abandoned. With the abandoning of craving, kamma is abandoned. With the abandoning of kamma, suffering is abandoned….</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“He develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, measureless, without ill will. When he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion … without ill will, craving is abandoned. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.v.87'></a> With the abandoning of craving, kamma is abandoned. With the abandoning of kamma, suffering is abandoned.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Thus, Udayī, with the destruction of craving comes the destruction of kamma; with the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering.”</p>
