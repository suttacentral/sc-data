<h1>46.41. Discriminations</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past abandoned the three discriminations, all did so because they had developed and cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment. Whatever ascetics or brahmins in the future will abandon the three discriminations, all will do so because they will have developed and cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment. Whatever ascetics or brahmins at present abandon the three discriminations, all do so because they have developed and cultivated the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity. Whatever ascetics or brahmins in the past … in the future … at present abandon the three discriminations, all do so because they have developed and cultivated these seven factors of enlightenment.” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.v.99'></a></p>
