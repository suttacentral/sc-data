<h1>4.9. Life Span (1)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Bhikkhus, this life span of human beings is short. One has to go on to the future life. One should do what is wholesome and lead the holy life; for one who has taken birth there is no avoiding death. One who lives long, bhikkhus, lives a hundred years or a little longer.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a> “Long is the life span of human beings,<br>
The good man should not disdain it.<br>
One should live like a milk-sucking baby:<br>
Death has not made its arrival.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “Short is the life span of human beings,<br>
The good man should disdain it.<br>
One should live like one with head aflame:<br>
There is no avoiding Death’s arrival.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
