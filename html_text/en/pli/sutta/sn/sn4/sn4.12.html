<h1>4.12. Lion</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.110'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then it occurred to Mara the Evil One: “This ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly. Let me approach the ascetic Gotama in order to confound them.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a> “Why now do you roar like a lion,<br>
Confident in the assembly?<br>
For there is one who’s a match for you,<br>
So why think yourself the victor?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a> “The great heroes roar their lion’s roar<br>
Confident in the assemblies—<br>
The Tathagatas endowed with the powers<br>
Have crossed over attachment to the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
