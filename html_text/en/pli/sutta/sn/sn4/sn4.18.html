<h1>4.18. Alms</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Magadhans at the brahmin village of Pañcasala. <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.i.114'></a> Now on that occasion the gift-festival of the young people was being held at the brahmin village of Pañcasala. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Pañcasala for alms. Now on that occasion Mara the Evil One had taken possession of the brahmin householders of Pañcasala, <span class='add'>inciting in them the thought,</span> “Don’t let the ascetic Gotama get alms.”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>Then the Blessed One left Pañcasala with his bowl just as cleanly washed as it was when he entered it for alms. Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and said to him: “Maybe you got alms, ascetic?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Was it you, Evil One, who saw to it that I didn’t get alms?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“Then, venerable sir, let the Blessed One enter Pañcasala a second time for alms. I will see to it that the Blessed One gets alms.”</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a> “You have produced demerit, Mara,<br>
Having assailed the Tathagata.<br>
Do you really think, O Evil One,<br>
‘My evil does not ripen’?</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a> “Happily indeed we live,<br>
We who own nothing at all.<br>
We shall dwell feeding on rapture<br>
Like the devas of Streaming Radiance.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
