<h1>21.2. Upatissa</h1>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a>At Savatthi. There the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Here, friends, when I was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in my mind thus: ‘Is there anything in the world through the change and alteration of which sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair might arise in me?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘There is nothing in the world through the change and alteration of which sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair might arise in me.’”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Venerable Sāriputta: “Friend Sāriputta, even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, wouldn’t sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair arise in you?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Friend, even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, still sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise in me. However, it would occur to me: ‘The Teacher, so influential, so powerful and mighty, has passed away. If the Blessed One had lived for a long time, that would have been for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.’” <a class='pts_pn' id='sn.ii.275'></a></p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>“It must be because I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Sāriputta for a long time that even if the Teacher himself were to undergo change and alteration, still sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair would not arise in him.”</p>
