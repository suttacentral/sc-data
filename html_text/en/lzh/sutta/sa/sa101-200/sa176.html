<h1>176. <span class='add'>[First Discourse on Establishing Contemplation of the Body]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “For the sake of eradicating impermanent things, one should accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body. What things are impermanent? That is, bodily form is impermanent. For the sake of eradicating that <span class='add'>[thing]</span>, one should accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body. <span class='add'>In the same way</span> feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent. For the sake of eradicating that <span class='add'>[thing]</span>, one should accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Just as</span> “[bodily form] is impermanent”, <span class='add'>in the same way</span> “past bodily form is impermanent”, “future bodily form <span class='add'>[is impermanent]</span>”, “present bodily form <span class='add'>[is impermanent]</span>”, “past and future bodily form <span class='add'>[is impermanent]</span>”, “past and present bodily form <span class='add'>[is impermanent]</span>”, “future and present bodily form <span class='add'>[is impermanent]</span>”, “past, future, and present bodily form is impermanent. For the sake of eradicating that <span class='add'>[thing]</span>, one should accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class='add'>is also like this</span>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Just as</span> “[one should] accordingly be established in contemplating the internal body as a body” <span class='add'>in eight modes</span>, <span class='add'>in the same way</span> “[one should] accordingly be established in contemplating the external body as a body”, “in contemplating the internal and external body as a body”, “in contemplating internal feelings as feelings”, “in contemplating external feelings as feelings”, “in contemplating internal and external feelings as feelings”, “in contemplating internal mental states as mental states”, “in contemplating external mental states as mental states”, “in contemplating internal and external mental states as mental states”, “in contemplating internal dharmas as dharmas”, “in contemplating external dharmas as dharmas”, “in contemplating internal and external dharmas as dharmas”, <span class='add'>eight discourses are also to be recited for each of these as above.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Just as for</span> “the sense of cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness for eradicating what is impermanent”, <span class='add'>in the same way for</span> “the sense of accordingly cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness for understanding <span class='add'>[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of extinguishing <span class='add'>[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of vomiting out <span class='add'>[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of ending <span class='add'>[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of relinquishing <span class='add'>[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of bringing to cease <span class='add'>[what is impermanent]</span>”, “the sense of making disappear <span class='add'>[what is impermanent]</span>”, <span class='add'>are also to be recited as above</span>.</p>
