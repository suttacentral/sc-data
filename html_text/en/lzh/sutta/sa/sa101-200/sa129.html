<h1>129. <span class='add'>[Third Discourse on Being of the Nature to be Abandoned]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula, at that time being with an attendant monk by the name of Rādha.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to Rādha: “Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated as being completely of the nature to be abandoned. Having examined it as of the nature to be abandoned, desire and lust for bodily form are abandoned. Desire and lust having been abandoned, I say that the mind is well liberated. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class='add'>is also like this</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
