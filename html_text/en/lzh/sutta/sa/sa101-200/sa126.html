<h1>126. <span class='add'>[Discourse on Being of a Mortal Nature]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula, at that time being with an attendant monk by the name of Rādha.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to Rādha: “Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated as being completely of a mortal nature. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class='add'>is also like this</span>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>The rest should be recited as before.</span></p>
