<h1>121. <span class='add'>[Discourse on Being of a Mortal Nature]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula, at that time being with an attendant monk by the name of Rādha.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to the monk Rādha: “Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it is all completely of a mortal nature. Whatever feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it is all completely of a mortal nature.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “Is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “What is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is <i>dukkha</i>, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha asked]: “Is feeling … perception … formations … consciousness permanent or is it impermanent?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “What is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is <i>dukkha</i>, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “What is impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, of a nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard it as the self, as distinct from the self <span class='add'>[in the sense of being owned by it]</span>, as existing <span class='add'>[within the self, or the self]</span> as existing <span class='add'>[within it]</span>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “No, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “If a learned noble disciple examines these five aggregates of clinging as they really are as not self and not belonging to a self, he does not cling to anything in the whole world. Not clinging to anything, he is not attached to anything. Because of not being attached to anything, he personally realizes Nirvāṇa, <span class='add'>[knowing]</span>: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
