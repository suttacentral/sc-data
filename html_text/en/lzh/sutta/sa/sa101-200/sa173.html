<h1>173. <span class='add'>[Second Discourse on Eradicating Impermanent Things]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should eradicate impermanent things of the past. Having eradicated those things will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace and happiness for a long time. What are impermanent things of the past? Past bodily form is an impermanent thing, past desire <span class='add'>[for it]</span> is an impermanent thing. You should eradicate those things. Having eradicated those things will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace and happiness for a long time. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class='add'>is also like this</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class='add'>In the same way <span class='add'>[discourses should be recited]</span></span> on future … present … past and present … future and present … past and future … past, future, and present <span class='add'>[things should be abandoned]</span>.</p>
