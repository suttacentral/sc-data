<h1>219. <span class='add'>[First Discourse on the Path to Nirvāṇa]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will now teach you the path to Nirvāṇa. What is the path to Nirvāṇa? That is, contemplate the eye as impermanent. Forms, eye-consciousness, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact that is experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, that is also impermanent.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class='add'>is also like that.</span> This is called the path to Nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
