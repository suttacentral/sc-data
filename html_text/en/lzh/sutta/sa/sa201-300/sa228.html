<h1>228. <span class='add'>[Discourse on What Increases]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I will now teach you what is of a nature to increase and what is of a nature to cease. What is of a nature to increase? That is, in dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The coming together of these three things is contact. In dependence on contact, there is feeling … <span class='add'>to be spoken in full up to</span> … this is the arising of the entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i>. This is called being of a nature to increase.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class='add'>is also like that</span>. This is called being of a nature to increase.</p>
<p>“What is of a nature to cease? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The coming together of these three things is contact. With the cessation of contact, feeling then ceases … <span class='add'>to be spoken in full up to</span> … the cessation of the entire great mass of <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class='add'>is also like that</span>. This is called being of a nature to cease.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
<p><span class='add'>As for</span> increasing and ceasing<span class='add'>, in the same way also for</span> being of a nature to rise up, being of a nature to change while remaining, being of a nature to rise, and being of a nature to cease, <span class='add'>[discourses] are to be recited as above</span>.</p>
