<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Vesālī in Jīvaka’s Mango Grove.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should cultivate boundless concentration, energetically and with collected mindfulness. Why is that? Having cultivated boundless concentration, energetically and with collected mindfulness, <span class='add'>[things]</span> then manifest as they really are. What manifests as it really is? The eye manifests it really is … <span class='add'>to be spoken in full up to</span> … All these things, being impermanent and conditioned, manifest as they really are.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
