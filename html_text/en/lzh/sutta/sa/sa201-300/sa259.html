<h1>259. <span class='add'>Discourse on Comprehension</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. At that time the venerable Sāriputta and <span class='add'>the venerable</span> Mahākoṭṭhita were on Mount Vulture Peak.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Mahākoṭṭhita rose from meditation and approached Sāriputta. Having exchanged polite greetings and expressed their mutual delight, Mahākoṭṭhita withdrew to sit at one side and then said to Sāriputta: “I would like to ask a question. Friend, would you have free time to show me the answer?”</p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “Friend, you can just ask, on knowing it I shall reply.”</p>
<p>Then Mahākoṭṭhita asked Sāriputta: “If a monk, who has not yet attained comprehension of the Dharma, wishes to seek comprehension of the Dharma, how should he diligently seek for it?What things should he give attention to?”</p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “If a monk, who has not yet attained comprehension of the Dharma, wishes to seek comprehension of the Dharma, he should energetically give attention to the five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a killer, as impermanent, as <i>dukkha</i>, as empty, and as not self. Why is that? Because it is possible that a monk who energetically gives attention to these five aggregates of clinging <span class='add'>in this way</span> attains the realization of the fruit of stream-entry.”</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahākoṭṭhita</span> asked again: “Sāriputta, having attained the realization of the fruit of stream-entry and wishing to attain the realization of the fruit of once-return, what things should he give attention to?”</p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “<span class='add'>Mahā</span>koṭṭhita, having attained the realization of the fruit of stream-entry and wishing to attain the realization of the fruit of once-return, he should also energetically give attention to the nature of these five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a killer, as impermanent, as <i>dukkha</i>, as empty, and as not self. Why is that? Because it is possible that a monk who energetically gives attention to these five aggregates of clinging <span class='add'>in this way</span> attains the realization of the fruit of once-return.”</p>
<p>Mahākoṭṭhita asked Sāriputta again: “Having attained the realization of the fruit of once-return and wishing to attain the realization of the fruit of non-return, what things should he give attention to?”</p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “<span class='add'>Mahā</span>koṭṭhita, having attained the realization of the fruit of once-return and wishing to attain the realization of the fruit of non-return, he should again energetically give attention to the nature of these five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a killer, as impermanent, as <i>dukkha</i>, as empty, and as not self. Why is that? Because it is possible that a monk who energetically gives attention to these five aggregates of clinging <span class='add'>in this way</span> attains the realization of the fruit of non-return.” <a class='t' id='t65c'></a></p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahākoṭṭhita asked Sāriputta again: “Having attained the realization of the fruit of non-return and wishing to attain the realization of the fruit of arahantship, what things should he give attention to?”</span></p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “Mahākoṭṭhita, having attained the realization of the fruit of non-return and wishing to attain the realization of the fruit of arahantship, he should again energetically give attention to the nature of these five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a killer, as impermanent, as <i>dukkha</i>, as empty, and as not self. Why is that? Because it is possible that a monk who energetically gives attention to these five aggregates of clinging <span class='add'>in this way</span> attains the realization of the fruit of arahantship.”</p>
<p>Mahākoṭṭhita asked Sāriputta again: “Having attained the realization of the fruit of arahantship, what things should he further give attention to?”</p>
<p>Sāriputta said: “Mahākoṭṭhita, an arahant still gives attention to the nature of these five aggregates of clinging as a disease, as a carbuncle, as a thorn, as a killer, as impermanent, as <i>dukkha</i>, as empty and as not self. Why is that? <span class='add'>Not</span> for the sake of attaining what had not been attained, for the sake of realizing what had not been realized, <span class='add'>but</span> for the sake of a pleasant abiding in the here and now.”</p>
<p>Then the two worthy ones delighted in hearing what each other had said and left.</p>
