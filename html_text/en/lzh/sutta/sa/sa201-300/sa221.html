<h1>221. <span class='add'>[Discourse on Clinging]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “There is a path that leads to all <span class='add'>[types of]</span> clinging. What is the path that leads to all <span class='add'>[types of]</span> clinging? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The coming together of these three things is contact. In dependence on contact, there is feeling. In dependence on feeling, there is craving. In dependence on craving, there is clinging. Therefore there is clinging and what is clung to.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class='add'>is also like that.</span> Therefore there is clinging and what is clung to. This is called the path that leads to all <span class='add'>[types of]</span> clinging.”</p>
<p>“What is the path of abandoning all <span class='add'>[types of]</span> clinging? In dependence on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The coming together of these three things is contact. With the cessation of contact, feeling then ceases. With the cessation of feeling, craving then ceases. With the cessation of craving, clinging then ceases.</p>
<p>“In the same way the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class='add'>is also like that.</span> <span class='add'>[This is called the path of abandoning all types of clinging]</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
