<h1>78. <span class='add'>Discourse on Arising</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “If bodily form arises, is established, and emerges, then <i>dukkha</i> arises therewith, disease is established therewith, and old age and death emerge therewith. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>should also be recited in the same way</i>.</p>
<p>“Monks, if bodily form ceases, is appeased, and disappears, <span class='add'>then</span> <i>dukkha</i> ceases therewith, disease is appeased therewith, and old age and death disappear therewith. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <i>are also like this</i>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
