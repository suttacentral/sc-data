<h1>2.58. The Emancipated Versus the Non-emancipated</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “What is the difference between one who is emancipated and one who is not emancipated?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “He who is not emancipated has attachment and desire in his heart. He who is emancipated is without attachment and desire in his heart and he eats food only for the sake of keeping alive.”</p>
<p>“I see people in the world craving for bodily pleasure, delicious food, and who are never satisfied.”</p>
<p>“He who is not emancipated wants to take delicious food for his fame, his happiness and good taste. But he who is emancipated takes food <a class='t' id='t716c'></a> not for his pleasure, nor for its delicious taste, but only for the sake of keeping the body alive.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
