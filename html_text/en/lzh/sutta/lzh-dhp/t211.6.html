<h1>6. On reflection</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='be' id='be1'></a>In olden time, when Buddha was in the world, a certain Rāja called Fo-kia-sha was a friend of Bimbisāra Rāja; the first, however, was not a believer in Buddha, as Bimbisāra was. On a certain occasion Vaksha had sent seven precious umbrellas (chattas) to his friend Bimbisāra, On receiving them, the latter offered them to Buddha, and said, “My friend, Vaksha Rāja, has presented me with these precious umbrellas! Pray permit me to offer them to you, with the intention that his heart may be convinced and his eyes opened to behold Buddha, and he be thus led to receive your doctrine, and reverence the Holy Assembly as his reward.” Then Buddha replied: “Bimbasāra Rāja, cause to be written the Sūtra of the twelve Nidānas, and present the book to that king in return for the seven precious umbrellas; and his heart will be enlightened (or, receive deliverance wrought by Faith).” [Accordingly Bimbisāra did so, and his friend, in consequence, was convinced and became a disciple; and finally gave up the kingdom to his son. Having failed to obtain an interview with Buddha, although he had frequently met him in begging through the streets of Rājagriha, the Teacher at length caused the appearance of a Shaman to meet the king, and explain to him that by reflection on the work in his possession he might truly behold Buddha; and to this he added these words]:—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The man who takes refuge in Buddha, this is the man who obtains real advantage. Night and day, therefore, he ought ever to reflect on Buddha, the Law and the Church. Being thus truly enlightened, this man is a disciple of Buddha. Thus reflecting continually on the three Treasures, and on impermanency, and his own body, reflecting on moral duty, on charity, on the emptiness of all things around him, and their unreality (without marks), these are subjects for consideration.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[On hearing these words Vaksha entered on the third path, and obtained rest.]</p>
