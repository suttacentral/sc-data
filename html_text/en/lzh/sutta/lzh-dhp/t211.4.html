<h1>4. Simple faith</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='be' id='be1'></a>In the days of old, to the south-east of Śrāvastī, there was a great River, very deep and wide, on the banks of which there was a hamlet, consisting of some 500 houses, the inhabitants of which had not yet heard the news of Salvation, and were consequently immersed entirely in worldliness and selfish pursuits.<br>
The Honoured of the world, ever thinking on the salvation of men, resolved to go to this village and preach to the people. Accordingly, he came to the river-side, and sat down beneath a tree. The village people, seeing the glory of his appearance, approached with reverence to worship him. After they had so done, Buddha began to preach to them, but they believed him not. On this Buddha caused the appearance of a man coming from the south side of the river, where the water was very deep and the current strong, walking on the surface of it; and so coming, he approached Buddha, and, bowing down, worshipped him.<br>
All the people, seeing this appearance, asked the man in astonishment, whence he had come, “for we never in all our lives have seen such a sight as this, a man walking on the surface of the water. Tell us, then, by what artifice has this been done, and how it was you were not engulphed in the stream.” On which the man replied : “I reside on the southern bank of the river, and had ever lived in ignorance and folly till I heard that Buddha was here teaching the way of deliverance, on which, coming to the bank of the river, and not having time to wait to be carried over, I asked the men if it was deep, and whether I could not cross over without a boat. On which they said, 'Oh yes! you can cross without fear.' On this I walked over, because I believed. Simply this and nothing more enabled me to do so.” On this Buddha said: “It is well spoken—well spoken. Faith like yours alone can save the world from the yawning gulf of continual birth and death; such faith alone can enable them to walk across dryshod (to the other shore),” and then he added these lines:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Faith can cross the flood, even as the master of the ship (steers his bark across the sea); ever advancing in the conquest of sorrow, wisdom lands us on yonder shore. The wise man who lives by faith, in virtue of his holy life, enjoys unselfish bliss, and casts off all shackles. Faith lays hold of true wisdom (or finds the path); Religion leads to deliverance from death; from hearing comes knowledge, which brings with it enlightenment; faith, width obedience (moral conduct), is the path of wisdom: firmly persevering in this, a man finds escape from pain, and is thus able to pass over and escape the gulf of destruction.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearing these words, these villagers were filled with joy, and embracing the five rules, were enabled to believe on Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='be' id='be2'></a>When Buddha was living in the world there was a certain nobleman called Su-lo-to (Śraddha?), of great wealth, who from a principle of faith had resolved to entertain Buddha and his disciples on the eighth day of every month in Lent <span class='add'>(i.e., the months of rain)</span>; but on these occasions none of his sons or grandsons ever made their appearance, being engrossed in other matters. At length the nobleman died, and as none of the children cared about entertaining Buddha, a servant boy called Pi-lo-to (Vraddah?) resolved to do so. Consequently, having borrowed 500 pieces of money, he proceeded to invite the Master and his 1200 disciples to his house. After the entertainment and the departure of the guests, he went to rest; when lo! on waking the next morning, he found his house full of silver and gold and all precious substances.<br>
On going to Buddha, the Master explained that this was the result of his faith, and then added these lines:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Faith is wealth! Obedience is wealth! Modesty also is wealth! Hearing is wealth, and so is Charity! Wisdom is sevenfold riches. Walking by Faith, ever pure, a man perceives the Truth (the Law). Wisdom is as sandals on the feet to him who walks. To receive with respect instruction, and not forget it, this, whoever he be, and however born, is wealth: no question is asked whether he be male or female, it is this alone that will bring gain at the last. Whosoever is wise will understand these truths.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having heard these words, Pi-lo-to was enabled to believe, and became a disciple; and so his wife also, and his children.</p>
