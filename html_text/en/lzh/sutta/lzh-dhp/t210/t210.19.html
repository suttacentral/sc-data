<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.1'></a>What’s there to rejoice about, what’s there to laugh about?<br>
Life is always in a blaze!<br>
Deeply concealed in Darkness,<br>
It’s better to seek light.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.2'></a>Look at this physical body<br>
Which [the fool] clings to as comfort.<br>
It’s full of [false] thinking and causes sickness,<br>
How does [the fool] know it’s unreality?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.3'></a>When one gets old, the body becomes weak,<br>
Sickness befalls and lustre is lost;<br>
The skin slackens, and muscles contract.<br>
One is fast approaching death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.4'></a>When the body dies, consciousness departs,<br>
Like a driver abandoning a vehicle;<br>
The flesh disappears, the bones scatter<br>
What is there in the body to rely on?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.5'></a>The body is like a city,<br>
Framed with bones and plastered with the flesh.<br>
From birth till old-age and death,<br>
It stores nothing but hatred and conceit.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.6'></a>When one gets old, the body changes,<br>
Just like an old vehicle.<br>
The Dharma can end suffering<br>
—Practice it with diligence.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.7'></a>If a man has heard no [wise teaching]<br>
He will grow old to be like a bull:<br>
With only well developed flesh,<br>
But no wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.8'></a>The cycle of birth and death is boring;<br>
The coming and going is troublesome.<br>
When one’s thoughts are attached to the body,<br>
Endless suffering will follow.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.9'></a>As the wise perceives suffering,<br>
He accordingly abandons the body;<br>
His thoughts are ceased and conditioning cut off;<br>
And lust being ended, there is no more birth.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.10'></a>He who neither practices the Brahmā-like faring,<br>
Nor has acquired any wealth;<br>
At old age, is like a white heron<br>
Watching an empty pond.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.11'></a>If one neither observes the precepts,<br>
Nor accumulates wealth;<br>
When old and weak and panting,<br>
What’s the use of reminiscing the past?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.12'></a>At old age, one is like autumn leaves;<br>
One moves in filth, and wears tattered clothes.<br>
Life is rapidly escaping from this birth;<br>
There is no use to regret.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.13'></a>Life is running out as days and nights pass.<br>
Strive hard when there is still time.<br>
What pertains to the world is truly impermanent,<br>
Don’t be deluded and fall into darkness.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns19.14'></a>Learn to kindle the mind lamp,<br>
And train yourself to gain wisdom.<br>
Move away from taints, don’t get stained;<br>
Holding the [mind] candle, watch the stages of progress.</p>
