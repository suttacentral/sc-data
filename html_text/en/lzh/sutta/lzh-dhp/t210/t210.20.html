<h1>20. Self Concern</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.1'></a>He who has love for himself<br>
Should consciously protect what’s being guarded,<br>
He should aspire for the release from craving<br>
And, forgoing sleep, to be rectified.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.2'></a>Oneself comes first,<br>
One should train hard oneself,<br>
When benefit is derived, then instruct others.<br>
The wise is thus vexed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.3'></a>First learn to rectify oneself,<br>
Then only rectify others.<br>
Train yourself to enter wisdom,<br>
And you will surely move upwards.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.4'></a>If one cannot benefit oneself,<br>
How can one benefit others?<br>
When one’s mind is tamed, and body rectified,<br>
What aim is there that cannot be achieved?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.5'></a>What has been done by oneself before,<br>
One will experience it’s effect later.<br>
Having done evil one [suffers] through oneself,<br>
Like a diamond boring through a gem.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.6'></a>If one does not observe the precepts,<br>
[Craving] will spread a like a rattan creeper.<br>
One’s desires being unrestrained,<br>
Evil actions will increase day by day.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.7'></a>Evil actions endanger oneself;<br>
They are easy for the fool.<br>
Good actions are one’s best security;<br>
They are difficult for the fool.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.8'></a>Those who accord with the True Men’s teaching,<br>
And live in accordance with the Truth,<br>
The fool envies them,<br>
And views them as evil.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.9'></a>Evil actions yield bad [results],<br>
Like the sowing of bitter seeds.<br>
Having done evil, one suffers oneself;<br>
Having done good, one experiences happiness oneself.<br>
And each [result] must ripen [accordingly]<br>
—It cannot be [experienced] on each other’s behalf.<br>
[Like-wise], good actions yield good [results],<br>
Like the sowing of sweet seeds.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.10'></a>One should benefit oneself as well as others,<br>
And there will be benefit without much effort.<br>
If one desires to know how to benefit oneself,<br>
[Here it is]: Precepts and knowledge are the best.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.11'></a>One who has love for himself,<br>
And wishes to be reborn in heavens,<br>
Should, with respect and delight, listen to the Dharma<br>
And remember the Buddha’s Teachings.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.12'></a>One must think carefully before any undertaking,<br>
So that one’s effort must not be spoilt.<br>
Thus one’s thinking becomes more and more trained,<br>
And one does not miss the time for any undertaking.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns20.13'></a>One who has his undertaking well prepared,<br>
Can reach the goal and achieve profit.<br>
A true understanding should be put into practice,<br>
And one will thereby achieve one’s aim.</p>
