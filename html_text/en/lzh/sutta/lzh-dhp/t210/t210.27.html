<h1>27. The Spiritually Committed</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.1'></a>He who is committed to the spiritual path<br>
Does not compete for profits.<br>
Regarding the profitable and the unprofitable,<br>
He is desireless and undeluded.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.2'></a>He who is ever kind and ready to learn,<br>
Who courses with a righteous mind<br>
Embracing the precious [Dharma] at heart, wise;<br>
Is indeed one cultivating the path.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.3'></a>One becomes a wise one<br>
Not necessarily by arguing much.<br>
He who is secure and fearless<br>
And guards his goodness, is indeed wise.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.4'></a>One is an upholder of the Dharma<br>
Not simply by speaking much.<br>
He who, though not having heard much<br>
Puts the Dharma into practice himself<br>
And who forgets not the Teaching<br>
May be called a Dharma uholder.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.5'></a>One becomes an elder<br>
Not simply by being old,<br>
With ripened body and grey hairs.<br>
Such a person [can] be just a fool.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.6'></a>He in whom are truth, Dharma,<br>
Restraint and kindness;<br>
Who is wise and pure,<br>
Is indeed an Elder.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.7'></a>One becomes graceful<br>
Not by having flower-like complexion<br>
While being miserly, jealous and deceitful,<br>
And acting contrary to his words.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.8'></a>He who can renounce evil<br>
Having cut it off by its root,<br>
Who is wise and hatred-free<br>
Is said to be graceful.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.9'></a>One becomes a <i>śramaṇa</i><br>
Not merely by shaving one’s head<br>
While still telling lies and coveting,<br>
Full of desires like the ordinary people.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.10'></a>He who can stop doing evil<br>
Who generously propagates the Teaching<br>
Who stills his mind and thoughts<br>
Is indeed a <i>śramaṇa</i>.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.11'></a>One becomes a <i>bhikṣu</i><br>
Not merely by begging at times<br>
While having evil acts and sexual indulgence<br>
This is <i>bhikṣu</i> by name only.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.12'></a>He who abandoning bad and good<br>
being pure, leads the spiritual life<br>
Who is wise and destroys evil,<br>
Is indeed a <i>bhikṣu</i>.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.13'></a>One becomes a sage<br>
Not by [mere] silence,<br>
Having impure intentions wihtin<br>
And pretending externally.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.14'></a>He whose mind attaches to naught,<br>
Who courses contentedly within<br>
Having attained quiescence here and beyond<br>
Is indeed a sage.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.15'></a>One is said to be spiritually advanced<br>
Not [simply] by saving one life<br>
He who strives for universal salvation,<br>
Harmless, is indeed spiritually advanced.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.16'></a>Do not boast of your observances,<br>
[Or that] “My actions are mostly truthful.”<br>
[Or that] “I have attained mental concentration<br>
By resorting to solitude.”</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns27.17'></a>Be determined to seek happiness;<br>
Don’t learn from the ordinary worldlings.<br>
So long as your corruptions are not extinct<br>
You will not be liberated.</p>
