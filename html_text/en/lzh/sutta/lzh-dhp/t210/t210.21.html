<h1>21. The World</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.1'></a>As a cart traveling on the road,<br>
Which, leaving the level, broad road,<br>
Turns onto a small side road and is crashed<br>
—There is the sorrow of the breaking of the axles.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.2'></a>Likewise, leaving the Dharma<br>
To follow and develop that opposed to Dharma,<br>
The fool keeps his way till death<br>
—And there is also the sorrow of being broken.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.3'></a>Fare in accordance with dhamma,<br>
Do not accord with evil deed;<br>
The dharma-farer sleeps well,<br>
And there is no sorrow in every existence.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.4'></a>All things are like foam,<br>
The mind is like a wild horse;<br>
Living in a world like a mirage,<br>
How can one delight in it?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.5'></a>If one can break away from this,<br>
Cutting the tree at its roots,<br>
And persisting thus day and night,<br>
One will surely achieve concentration.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.6'></a>Some give in accordance with faith,<br>
Like people who are happy;<br>
Others, from a perturbed mind,<br>
Offer food to the [monk-] community<br>
—Such people, day and night<br>
Achieve no mental concentration.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.7'></a>The worldlings have no eyes;<br>
They see not the truth of the Way.<br>
Those with even a little clarity of vision,<br>
Should nurture good thoughts.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.8'></a>Like a goose heading its group,<br>
To fly high in avoidance of the net;<br>
The wise one leads the world,<br>
To get freed from the evil ones.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.9'></a>All worldlings must die,<br>
There is no security in the three spheres.<br>
Though the gods may enjoy themselves,<br>
They too die when their merit is exhausted.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.10'></a>Observe the worldlings:<br>
No birth does not come to an end.<br>
If one wishes to escape the cycle of rebirth,<br>
One should practice the true Path.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.11'></a>Delusion covers up the whole world;<br>
Greed causes the loss of sight.<br>
False [views] and doubt lead to rejecting Truth.<br>
—The afflicted fool accords with these.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.12'></a>He who has transgressed one dharma,<br>
Namely, the liar,<br>
Will not escape future existence,<br>
And there’s no evil that he will not further do.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.13'></a>Though one may pile up treasure,<br>
To as high as the heavens,<br>
Thus filling up the whole world;<br>
It’s better to gain insight into the Path.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns21.14'></a>What is not good appears to be good,<br>
Lust appears to be not lust;<br>
Suffering is taken for happiness<br>
—The insane is devoted to [these false views].</p>
