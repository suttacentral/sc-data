<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.1'></a>Though the happiness in giving may be small<br>
Its retribution is very great.<br>
The wise one, from a small giving,<br>
Sees in retribution, a great blessing.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.2'></a>He who by causing hardship to others<br>
Seeks to gain blessing<br>
Misfortune will befall him,<br>
Having himself befriended enemies widely.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.3'></a>For one has done various things,<br>
Including the improper ones,<br>
And is sporty and heedless;<br>
His corruptions increase day by day.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.4'></a>He who vigorously practices meditation,<br>
Who pursues the proper and gives up the improper,<br>
Who cultivates himself and is mindful,<br>
Is indeed one endowed with the right practice.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.5'></a>For one who being intelligent,<br>
Is moreover keen to learn;<br>
[His knowledge] will gradually expand,<br>
Like ghee when thrown into water.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.6'></a>For one who being unintelligent,<br>
Is moreover not keen to learn;<br>
His knowledge will contract and get less,<br>
Like curd when thrown into water.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.7'></a>The names of the spiritual cultivators shine forth<br>
Like snow on high mountains.<br>
Those with no spirituality remain obscure<br>
Like arrows shot at night.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.8'></a>The disciples of the Buddha,<br>
Are ever awake and self-aware.<br>
Day and night the recollect the Buddha,<br>
Reflect on the Dharma, and are mindful of the Saṅgha.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.9'></a>The disciples of the Buddha<br>
Are ever awake and self-aware.<br>
Day and night they think of meditating,<br>
And delight in contemplation and one-mindedness.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.10'></a>One should maintain mindfulness<br>
And know the amount to eat<br>
One” sensual craving is then reduced<br>
And digestion being regulated, one lives long.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.11'></a>Hard it is to undergo training and give up evil.<br>
Hard too it is to live the household life.<br>
Hard [also] is living and sharing with others.<br>
Of all hardships, existence is the greatest.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.12'></a>Hard it is for a <i>bhikṣu</i> to beg [for alms]<br>
How then can you not spur yourself on?<br>
With vigour, you’ll obtain ease<br>
And thereafter you’ll not covet others’ [things].</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.13'></a>He who has faith will be endowed with virtue;<br>
From virtue, he will attain wealth;<br>
From the same will he obtain a happy partner;<br>
Wherever he goes, he receives offerings.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns29.14'></a>He who sits alone, rests in one place,<br>
Walks alone, unindolent,<br>
And keeping to solitude rectifies the self;<br>
Will delight in forest dwelling.</p>
