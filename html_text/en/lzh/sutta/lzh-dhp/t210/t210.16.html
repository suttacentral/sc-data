<h1>16. On the Thousands</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.1'></a>Though one might recite thousand words;<br>
If their meanings be improper,<br>
It’s better to recite one with essential [meaning]<br>
Hearing which thoughts will come to cease.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.2'></a>Though one might recite a thousand chapters;<br>
What’s the use if they be meaningless?<br>
It’s better to recite one with meaning,<br>
Hearing and practicing which one crosses over.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.3'></a>Though one might recite many sūtras,<br>
What’s the use if one does not understand?<br>
[It’s better] to understand one dharma verse,<br>
Practicing which one may attain Enlightenment.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.4'></a>Battling with thousands and thousands of men,<br>
One man might be the victor,<br>
But he who conquers himself is better<br>
He is indeed the greatest in battle.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.5'></a>Best indeed is one who has conquered himself<br>
He is as such called the King of men<br>
Guarding his thoughts and training his self,<br>
He restrains himself till the end.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.6'></a>Even the gods, said to be exalted,<br>
Or demigods or Māra or Brahmā or Śakra,<br>
None of them can defeat<br>
A man who has conquered himself.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.7'></a>One might each month offer sacrifices by the thousand,<br>
And continue doing so for one’s whole life;<br>
This is not as good as, for a single moment<br>
Recollecting the Dharma with one-mindedness<br>
The merit of one such thought<br>
Excels that of [offering sacrifice] for a whole life.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.8'></a>Though for a whole century,<br>
One might attend to the sacrificial fire;<br>
It’s better, even if for a single moment,<br>
To make offerings to the Three Honoured Ones</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.9'></a>If one offers sacrifice to gods, for the merit’s sake,<br>
And subsequently expects reward from it;<br>
This would not amount to a fourth [the merit]<br>
From paying respect to the virtuous ones.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.10'></a>In him who properly conforms to etiquette<br>
And always respects the elders,<br>
Four blessings automatically increase;<br>
Beauty, strength, long-life, and happiness.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.11'></a>If one lives a hundred years,<br>
Away from [mental] rectitude and unethical;<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
Being ethical, mentally rectified and meditative.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.12'></a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Crooked, insincere and without wisdom;<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
With a mind concentrated, acquiring true wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.13'></a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Sluggishly and without diligence;<br>
It’s better to live a single day,<br>
Doing one’s best and with diligence.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.14'></a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Without perceiving the rise and fall of things;<br>
It’s better to live a single day,<br>
Doing’s one’s best and with diligence.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.15'></a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Without seeing the Path of Ambrosia;<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
Tasting-practicing-the flavor of Ambrosia.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns16.16'></a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Without knowledge of Righteousness.<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
Studying the essentials of the Buddha’s dharma.</p>
