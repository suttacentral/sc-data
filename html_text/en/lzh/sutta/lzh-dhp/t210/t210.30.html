<h1>30. The Hells</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.1'></a>The liar approaches hell,<br>
[Also] he who having done something says he hasn’t.<br>
Both these offenders here after will suffer alike,<br>
Having dragged themselves there with such actions.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.2'></a>Those who donning the robes;<br>
Commit evil, and are unrestrained;<br>
Such base evil doers,<br>
At death will fall into hells.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.3'></a>If one, being immoral, acccepts offerings,<br>
Would he not be harming himself?<br>
At death he will swallow red-hot iron balls,<br>
And be burnt by flaring charcoals.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.4'></a>Four things beset the heedless man<br>
Who is fond of committing adultery:<br>
[First] bad sleep, [second] demerit,<br>
Third ill-repute, and fourth sensual indulgence.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.5'></a>There being demerit, he will have bad rebirth.<br>
The fearful [man] and fearful [woman] enjoy but little.<br>
The king imposes heavy punishment on them.<br>
And at death they go to hell.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.6'></a>Just as in the uprooting of wild grasses;<br>
If not grabbed properly, they cut the hand.<br>
In ethical training, if there be no proper restraint,<br>
One is picked for hell through one’s own making.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.7'></a>In the ordinary man’s faring, if there be slackness,<br>
It cannot lead to the removal of hardship.<br>
In the spiritual faring, if there be faults,<br>
It will never yield great blessing.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.8'></a>Always do what you ought to do,<br>
Persevere and make your practice strong.<br>
Separate yourself from the heretics;<br>
Don’t be influenced and tainted.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.9'></a>If one does what ought not be done,<br>
One will later be poisoned with depression.<br>
If one does good one will always be well,<br>
And wherever one is, one has no remorse.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.10'></a>He who with regard to an evil deed,<br>
Intends to do or has already done;<br>
Cannot be freed from the ensuing suffering:<br>
Evil retribution nearing, he finds no escape.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.11'></a>He who gives false evidence to get bribes;<br>
He who himself having behaved improperly,<br>
Malign the good ones out of hatred;<br>
He who treats the learened unjustly;<br>
—Such people, bound by their evil,<br>
Throw themselves into pits.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.12'></a>Like a guarded border city;<br>
Firm within and without.<br>
So guard your own mind,<br>
[Let] no evil thought arise.<br>
Lapses in action beget grief;<br>
And will lead you to hell.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.13'></a>Those unashamed of what is shameful,<br>
And ashamed of what is not shameful;<br>
—Such beings, disposed towards false views;<br>
Go to hell at death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.14'></a>Those unafraid of the fearful,<br>
And afraid of what is not fearful;<br>
—Such beings, disposed towards false views;<br>
Go to hell at death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.15'></a>Those who don’t shun what should be shunned,<br>
And don’t approach what should be approached;<br>
—Such beings, addicted to false views,<br>
Go to hell at death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns30.16'></a>Those who approach what should be approached,<br>
And leave what should be left behind<br>
—Such beings, always keeping to right views,<br>
Go to good destinies at death.</p>
