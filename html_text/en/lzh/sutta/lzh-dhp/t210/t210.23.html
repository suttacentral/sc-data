<h1>23. Happiness</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.1'></a>We already live in happiness,<br>
Hating not amidst the hateful.<br>
While others harbour hatred,<br>
We live without hating.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.2'></a>We already live in happiness,<br>
Not falling sick among the sick.<br>
While others fall sick,<br>
We course without sickness.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.3'></a>We already live in happiness,<br>
Worrying not amidst the worried.<br>
While others have worries,<br>
We course without worrying.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.4'></a>We already live in happiness,<br>
Pure, desiring naught.<br>
We feed on joy,<br>
Even as Radiant Devas.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.5'></a>We already live in happiness<br>
Living a simple life, contented.<br>
The fire of Mithila kingdom<br>
—How can it burn us?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.6'></a>Victory begets hatred;<br>
The defeated feels inferior.<br>
Renouncing thoughts of victory and defeat,<br>
One is happy, without combating.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.7'></a>There is no heat like lust,<br>
There is no poison like anger;<br>
There is no misery like the body;<br>
There is no happiness like the quiescence [of Nirvāṇa].</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.8'></a>Without being happy with small happiness,<br>
Small eloquence, small intelligence;<br>
He who sets up his mind on the big ones,<br>
Will achieve big happiness.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.9'></a>I am the World Honoured One,<br>
Forever released, sorrowless.<br>
I have perfectly transcended the triple existence;<br>
And alone, defeated the evil ones.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.10'></a>Happiness is seeing the holy ones.<br>
Happiness is the association [with them].<br>
Being able to part with fools<br>
Is good and uniquely happy.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.11'></a>Happiness is the keeping to the Right Path.<br>
Happiness is the skillful preaching of Dharma.<br>
By not disputing with the world,<br>
And endowed with precepts, one is always happy.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.12'></a>Happiness is living with the virtuous,<br>
Like [that of] meeting with kinsfolk.<br>
He who draws near to the virtuous and wise<br>
Will hear much and get far away.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.13'></a>Few are those who live long,<br>
And many are those who leave the world.<br>
In one’s training one should seize the means<br>
Which gives happiness till old age.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns23.14'></a>For those wishing for the ambrosia,<br>
The cessation truth—the removal of craving—is bliss.<br>
Those wishing to transcend the suffering of saṃsāra;<br>
Should take the taste of ambrosia.</p>
