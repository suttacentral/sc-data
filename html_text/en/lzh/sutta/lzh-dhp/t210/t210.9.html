<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.1'></a>Mind is the origin of events<br>
They have mind as their chief, and are mind-impelled.<br>
If one harbors an evil thought in the mind<br>
And then speaks or acts;<br>
Suffering pursues one necessarily,<br>
As a cart [necessarily] rolls over the track.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.2'></a>Mind is the origin of events<br>
They have mind as their chief, and are mind-impelled.<br>
If one harbors an evil thought in the mind<br>
And then speaks or acts;<br>
Happiness pursues one necessarily,<br>
As a shadow [necessarily] follows its substance.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.3'></a>One who accords with an improper mental attitude,<br>
And, bound by foolishness, enters into darkness,<br>
Who is arrogant, and [accepts] no Dharma<br>
—How can such a man understand the well-spoken?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.4'></a>One who accords with a proper mental attitude,<br>
Who understands clearly.<br>
And has no envy,<br>
—Such a man promptly understands the well-spoken.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.5'></a>One who resents the enemies<br>
Is never without an enemy.<br>
By not resenting [enmity] ceases naturally<br>
—This is the way to pursue.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.6'></a>Not delighting in blaming others<br>
One should examine oneself<br>
—He who realizes this,<br>
Will forever be noble and free.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.7'></a>One who lives seeing the body as pure,<br>
Unrestrained in the senses,<br>
Immoderate in food,<br>
Lazy and timid<br>
—Such a one is overcome by Evil,<br>
Like grass by wind.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.8'></a>One who contemplates the body as impure,<br>
Restrained in the senses.<br>
Moderate in food.<br>
And always delighting in effort<br>
—Such a person is unmoved by Evil,<br>
Like a huge mountain [unmoved] by wind.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.9'></a>One who does not vomit the poisons within,<br>
Whose craving mind races about,<br>
Who has not tamed himself;<br>
Is unworthy of the robe.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.10'></a>One who can vomit the poisons within,<br>
Who is ethically aligned and mentally appeased,<br>
Who has subdued the mind and is tamed,<br>
Is worthy of the robe.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.11'></a>Taking the real to be unreal,<br>
And the unreal, real;<br>
This is false thinking,<br>
And one will not get the benefit of the real.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.12'></a>Knowing the real as real,<br>
And the unreal, unreal;<br>
This is right thinking,<br>
And one surely gets the benefit of the real.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.13'></a>As when a house is well-roofed<br>
The rain will not get in.<br>
Mind restrained and actions watched,<br>
Lust will not arise.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.15'></a>The case of an evil man influencing another<br>
Is like that of one being near a foul thing;<br>
Being increasingly deluded and practicing wrong<br>
One unknowingly soon becomes evil.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.16'></a>The case of a virtuous man influencing another<br>
Is like that of one being near a fragrant thing<br>
Advancing in wisdom and practicing good,<br>
One becomes pure and fragrant in his actions.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.17'></a>There is sorrow in doing, and sorrow afterwards;<br>
For the evil doer, there is a two-fold sorrow.<br>
He is sorrowful, he is fearful on reflection,<br>
Seeing his evil, his mind is afflicted.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.18'></a>There is joy in doing, and joy afterwards;<br>
For a doer of good, there is a two-fold joy.<br>
He is joyful, he is delighted on reflection;<br>
Seeing his merit, his mind is happy.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.19'></a>He repents now, he repents afterwards;<br>
An evil doer repents doubly.<br>
His is a trouble of his own making<br>
His evil retributed, he is tormented.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.20'></a>He is delighted now, he is delighted afterwards;<br>
He who does good is doubly delighted.<br>
His is a blessing of his own making<br>
His merit retributed, he is happy.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.21'></a>Those speaking craftily and longing for much,<br>
Indulgent, observing no training rules,<br>
Having within lust, anger, and delusion,<br>
And not practicing concentration and insight.<br>
—Such people gather like a herd of cows.<br>
They are not followers of the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns9.22'></a>Those speaking timely and seeing for little,<br>
Living the spiritual life in accordance with the Dharma,<br>
Eliminating lust, hatred, and delusion,<br>
Possessing right thoughts and a liberated mind,<br>
Whose views are right, and not giving rise to [false ones]<br>
—Such people are disciples of the Buddha.</p>
