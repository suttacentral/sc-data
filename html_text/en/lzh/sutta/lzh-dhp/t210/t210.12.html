<h1>12. Flower Fragrance</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.1'></a>Who can select the land:<br>
Leaving hells behind and preferring heavens?<br>
Who speaks the words of Dharma,<br>
Like picking good flowers?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.2'></a>A trainee can select the land,<br>
Leaving hells behind and preferring heavens.<br>
He speaks well the Words of Dharma<br>
And can pick flowers of virtues.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.3'></a>He who knows worldly phenomena as earthenware,<br>
Illusory, and coming abruptly into existence;<br>
Will break the blooming of Māra’s flowers,<br>
And see no more the lord of death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.4'></a>He who sees the body to be like foam,<br>
And all phenomena to be illusory in nature<br>
Will break the blooming of Māra’s flowers,<br>
And see no more the lord of death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.5'></a>When the body is sick, it withers away,<br>
Like the wilting flowers.<br>
When death befalls one,<br>
It dashes forth like rapids.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.6'></a>He who is insatiate in desires,<br>
His mind becomes distracted.<br>
Amassing wealth through evil means,<br>
He makes an attack on himself.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.7'></a>As a bee gathers [honey from] flowers,<br>
Without disturbing their colour and fragrance,<br>
Taking away only their taste<br>
Likewise do the sages enter the village.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.8'></a>Do not seek to observe others<br>
As to what they have or have not done;<br>
Always make self-reflection<br>
To know one’s rights and wrongs.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.9'></a>As a flower pleasing to the mind,<br>
With good colour but no fragrance;<br>
Likewise are fine words<br>
Which if not practiced yield no gain.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.10'></a>AS a flower pleasing to the mind,<br>
With beautiful colour as well as fragrance;<br>
Likewise are fine words<br>
Which if practiced yield blessings.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.11'></a>If one gathers many precious flowers,<br>
The garland made is of distinguished beauty.<br>
If one accumulates many virtues,<br>
One’s station of birth will change for the better.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.12'></a>Distinguished plants and scented flowers,<br>
Do not perfume against the wind.<br>
Those close to the blooming of Enlightenment<br>
—The virtuous—diffuse fragrance in all directions.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.13'></a>Sandal wood, and various scented substances<br>
Blue lotus, fragrant flowers<br>
[Their fragrance] though said to be real,<br>
Is inferior to the fragrance of morality.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.14'></a>The fragrance of flowers is faint;<br>
It cannot be called real.<br>
The fragrance of ethical alignment<br>
Reaches up to the heavens—It is excellent.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.15'></a>Those who are perfect in morality,<br>
Whose actions are not heedless,<br>
And who are freed through a concentrated mind<br>
Is far apart from Māra’s path.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.16'></a>As in a field-ditch<br>
Near the main road,<br>
A lotus could bloom,<br>
Fragrant, clean and charming.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns12.17'></a>Likewise, in the cycle of rebirth.<br>
Amidst the [lowest] end of worldlings,<br>
The wise ones delight in going forth,<br>
To be disciples of the Buddha.</p>
