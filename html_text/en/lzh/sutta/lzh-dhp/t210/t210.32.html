<h1>32. Craving</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.1'></a>If one’s mind is set on sexual activities,<br>
One’s craving increases, like [a creeper’s] branches<br>
Spreading and growing ever more luxuriantly;<br>
And the mind keeps leaping, like a monkey greedy for fruits.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.2'></a>One who for the sake of lust endures sorrow,<br>
Who owing to craving is attached to the world;<br>
His sorrow increases day and night,<br>
Growing and spreading like a vine.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.3'></a>Men are deluded because of passionate love;<br>
They are unable to give up passions.<br>
Thus do sorrow and passionate love increase,<br>
Like flowing water filling up a pond.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.4'></a>That there are sorrow, grief,<br>
And suffering in the world, of not [just] one kind,<br>
Is due to none but craving.<br>
Craving ceasing, there is no sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.5'></a>One’s own mind being at peace, craving is abandoned,<br>
Without craving, where is the world?<br>
Not grieving, nor seeking with defilement.<br>
Nor craving; whence is the world?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.6'></a>Some grieve because at the time of death.<br>
They want many kinsfolks to gather.<br>
Traversing a long journey of sorrow;<br>
They crave and suffer, always falling into distress.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.7'></a>One devoted to the spiritual life<br>
Must not befriend craving.<br>
First cut off the root of craving,<br>
So that it can no more take root.<br>
Don’t be like cutting reeds;<br>
Lest craving would arise again.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.8'></a>Like a tree with deep and firm root,<br>
Though cut down grows yet again;<br>
Craving thoughts not completely removed,<br>
One should expect further suffering.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.9'></a>Like a monkey, having left behind the trees,<br>
Returns to the trees having been freed;<br>
Even so do people in the world,<br>
Get out of hells only to return to hells.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.10'></a>Greedy thoughts constitute an incessant flow,<br>
Which habitually joins force with conceit.<br>
When one’s thoughts are inclined to lust,<br>
One conceals oneself, and sees nothing.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.11'></a>All thoughts flow and spread;<br>
The craving-fetter is like a rattan creeper.<br>
The wise alone can discern with discrimination,<br>
And cut off the source of [craving] thoughts.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.12'></a>Nourished by craving,<br>
One’s thoughts grow and spread.<br>
Craving is deep and fathomless,<br>
Adding strength to old-age and death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.13'></a>The tributaries produced are incessant,<br>
Feeding on craving alone.<br>
To nourish enemies and multiply graves,<br>
The fools are ever restlessly striving.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.14'></a>Though in prison, there are hooks and chains,<br>
The wise do not regard them as strong;<br>
The fools seeing their wives, sons and daughters-in-law<br>
Become attached—this craving is indeed strong.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.15'></a>The wise say that craving is a prison,<br>
Deep, strong, and difficult to escape.<br>
Therefore should it be cut and abandoned;<br>
Not bothered with desire, one is happy.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.16'></a>At the sight of a female, he is tempted,<br>
Not meditating on impermanence.<br>
The fool thinks [of her] as beautiful<br>
—How does he know its unreality?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.17'></a>[The fool] envelopes himself with sexual pleasure,<br>
Like the silkworms making their cocoons.<br>
The wise can give it up,<br>
And not being bothered by it, end all sufferings.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.18'></a>One whose mind is bent on heedlessness,<br>
Views sexual indulgence as being pure;<br>
His thoughts of passionate love being intensified,<br>
He thus creates a prison.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.19'></a>He whose thoughts cease in sexual craving,<br>
Is ever mindful of craving as impure.<br>
Thus does he leave the prison of evil,<br>
And end the problem of old age and death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.20'></a>[The fool] entangles himself with craving’s net,<br>
And gets himself covered up by lust’s lust.<br>
Being self-indulgent, he is imprisoned;<br>
Like a fish entering a trap.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.21'></a>Old-age and death await their chance<br>
Like calves wanting their mother’s milk.<br>
Craving abandoned and lust’s tracks obliterated,<br>
[The wise] leaves the net disentangled.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.22'></a>He who has completed the Way, freed from prison,<br>
Understanding all from one [end] to the other;<br>
Has transcended the practice of extremity.<br>
Such a man is a great wise one.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.23'></a>Don’t be close to those remote from the Dharma,<br>
Don’t be stained by lust either.<br>
He who has not cut off the three times,<br>
Will fall again into practice of extremity.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.24'></a>If one is awakened to [the true nature of] all dharmas,<br>
One will then not be attached to the dharmas;<br>
Having been freed from all thoughts of lust,<br>
One is said to have mastered the sages’ thoughts.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.25'></a>Of all gifts, the gift of Buddha’s discourses excels.<br>
Of all flavours, the flavour of Truth excels.<br>
Of all bliss, the bliss of Dharma excels.<br>
The exhaustion of lust excels all sufferings.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.26'></a>The fool binds himself with greed,<br>
And seeks not to cross over to the other shore.<br>
Owing to greed for wealth and lust,<br>
He kills others as well as himself.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.27'></a>The craving mind is the field;<br>
Lust, hatred and delusion are the seeds.<br>
Thus giving to those having transcended the world,<br>
One gains immeasurable amount of merit.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.28'></a>With a few companions but plenty of goods,<br>
A merchant trembles with fear.<br>
Craving is a robber that kills,<br>
Therefore the wise do not crave.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.29'></a>Where the mind agrees, there craving is.<br>
—Why then only the five-fold craving?<br>
The agreement defied and the five-fold craving cut,<br>
One becomes a hero indeed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.30'></a>Where there is no craving, there is no fear;<br>
Where there is contentment there is no sorrow.<br>
When craving is removed and fetters undone,<br>
One is said to be far out from the sea.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.31'></a>O craving! I know your source:<br>
You are born of thoughts in the mind.<br>
The moment I cease thinking of you,<br>
You will exist no more.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.32'></a>In cutting trees [of craving], don’t stop.<br>
So long as the trees grow, there will be evil,<br>
When each and every tree is cut,<br>
The <i>bhikṣu</i> will attain Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns32.33'></a>If the trees [of craving] are not cut<br>
—Even if there be a tiny bit of passion remaining,<br>
The mind will get hung up there<br>
Like the calves wanting [milk from] the mother.</p>
