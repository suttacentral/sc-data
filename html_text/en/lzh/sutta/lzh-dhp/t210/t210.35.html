<h1>35. The Brāhmaṇa</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.1'></a>Stop the stream [of craving] and cross over,<br>
Be desireless like a brāhma;<br>
Having known the exhaustion of conditionings,<br>
One is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.2'></a>By means of the non-dual dharma,<br>
He is purified and crosses the sea;<br>
All his fetters of desire are removed<br>
—Such a one is a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.3'></a>He who is at ease with other and no-other;<br>
For whom [both] other, [not] other, are avoid;<br>
He who gives up sensual craving;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.4'></a>He who is meditative, stainless;<br>
Whose deeds are corruption-free;<br>
In whom there does not arise higher seeking;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.5'></a>The sun glows by day;<br>
the moon shines by night;<br>
The warrior shines in the army;<br>
In meditation glows the spiritual cultivator.<br>
The Buddha appears in the world,<br>
Illuminating to dispel darkness everywhere.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.6'></a>One is not a brāhmaṇa on account of the shaven head;<br>
Nor is one a brāhmaṇa because one utters mantras.<br>
It is one who gives up all evil<br>
Whom may be called a spiritual cultivator.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.7'></a>A brāhmaṇa is one who exits from evil;<br>
A brāhmaṇa is one who enters rectitude.<br>
Having renounced one’s own defiled deeds.<br>
One is regarded as having left home.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.8'></a>If one is calmed with regard to the pleasant<br>
And at hearty attaches to naught<br>
—Having [thus] renounced and rectified [attachment]<br>
One extinguishes all sufferings.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.9'></a>He whose body, speech and mind<br>
Are pure without any fault;<br>
Who is restrained in this threefold action,<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.10'></a>If your mind understands<br>
The Teachings of the Buddha;<br>
Look into your mind and take refuge in yourself,<br>
[As a brāhmaṇa] purifies himself with water.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.11'></a>Neither on account of clan nor matted hairs.<br>
Is one called a brāhmaṇa<br>
He whose deeds are truthful and righteous,<br>
He is pure, and this makes him a virtuous one.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.12'></a>What for is your contrived hair, witless one!<br>
What for your straw clothes?<br>
When within you remain attached,<br>
What’s the use of external renunciation?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.13'></a>He who wears poor clothes,<br>
Who personally practices the dharma,<br>
Who meditates on retreat,<br>
—Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.14'></a>The Buddha does not teach one<br>
To elevate oneself and make self-claims:<br>
One according with truth, and undeceitful,<br>
May be called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.16'></a>He who has cut off the river of transmigration,<br>
Who has forbearance and transcends [the world],<br>
Who is self-awakened and out of the moats;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.17'></a>He who in the face of being abused and hit,<br>
Endures quietly without anger;<br>
Who has the power of patience;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.18'></a>He who, in the face of being attacked,<br>
Does naught but remains mindful of his precepts;<br>
Who maintains proper postures, self-controlled;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.19'></a>He who abandons evil dharmas in his mind,<br>
Like a snake shedding its skin;<br>
And is not tainted by desire.<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.20'></a>He who realizes life to be unsatisfactory,<br>
And thereby ceases to have [sensual] thoughts;<br>
Who can lay down the burden;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.21'></a>He who understands and has profound wisdom;<br>
Who distinguishes the right and wrong paths;<br>
And who has reached the high[est] goal;<br>
Is called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.22'></a>He who can give up the household life,<br>
And has no fear of the household;<br>
Who has few needs and little desire;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>

Who harbours no thoughts of killing,<br>
Who causes afflictions to no-one,<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>

Who resents not when offended,<br>
Who is friendly to the hostile;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.25'></a>He who removes greed, anger, delusion,<br>
Conceit and other evil,<br>
Like a snake shedding its skin;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.26'></a>He who is cut off from worldly associations;<br>
Who utters no harsh words;<br>
Who carefully investigates the Eight-fold Path;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.27'></a>Those considered by the world as good or bad,<br>
Those which are long, short thick thin<br>
—He takes not [any of them] which is not given;<br>
Such a one is a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.28'></a>One’s deeds being pure in this life,<br>
There can be no defilement in the life after.<br>
[Thus] without practicing any [evil dharmas].<br>
—One is called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.29'></a>Renouncing the body, without a supporting basis,<br>
Not reciting [the doctrines] of other disciplines;<br>
He attains the Deathless Cessation.<br>
Such a one is a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.30'></a>He who, with regard to good and evil,<br>
Has got rid of both these deeds,<br>
Free from sorrow and dust,<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.31'></a>He whose mind is joyful, stainless<br>
Like the moon in its fullness,<br>
Who is free from defamation,<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.32'></a>Seeing that the fools, in coming and going,<br>
Fall into the moats to suffer;<br>
He desires to cross over the other shore alone,<br>
Disregarding the words of others.<br>
Only he in whom [birth] ceases and arises no more,<br>
May be called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.33'></a>He who has cut off lust,<br>
Who is homeless, desireless,<br>
Whose lust for existence is destroyed<br>
May be called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.34'></a>He who is away from the uman community<br>
And does not fall into the celestial community.<br>
—Not going to any community whatsoever;<br>
May be called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.35'></a>He who has given up pleasure and displeasure;<br>
Who is extinguished, without heat remnant;<br>
Heroic, defeating the whole world;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.36'></a>He for whom birth is no more,<br>
And at death is without destination;<br>
Who is awakened, happy and detached;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>

And in the middle, there is naught;<br>
Without holding on, without discarding;<br>
He is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.39'></a>The most heroic, the most fearless,<br>
—He who is self-released,<br>
Who is enlightened, and whose mind is unshaken,<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns35.40'></a>He who knows his past lives,<br>
And his previous transmigrations:<br>
Who has the means for ending birth;<br>
Whose insight penetrates the highest profundity;<br>
Who is wise like a silent-one;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
