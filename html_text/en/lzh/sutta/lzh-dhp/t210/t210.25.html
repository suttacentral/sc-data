<h1>25. Anger</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.1'></a>He who is angry sees not the Dharma;<br>
He who is angry knows not the Way.<br>
He who can remove anger,<br>
Merit and joy always follow him.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.2'></a>He who is lustful sees not the Dharma;<br>
The same for he whose mind is deluded.<br>
He who removes lust and delusion,<br>
His merit stands foremost.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.3'></a>He who can refrain from anger,<br>
Like halting a running chariot;<br>
Is indeed a fine charioteer,<br>
Who leaves darkness to enter brightness.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.4'></a>Forbearance excels anger;<br>
Good excels evil;<br>
The winner is one who gives;<br>
Truthfulness excels deceit.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.5'></a>Do not cheat, do not get angry,<br>
Do not seek much in your mind,<br>
He who [can do] these three,<br>
Ascends to heaven at death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.6'></a>Those who are ever restrained in body,<br>
Who are kind and do not kill;<br>
Go to the celestial abodes<br>
And having reached there become sorrowless.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.7'></a>Those whose mind is always awake.<br>
Who diligently practice day and night;<br>
With their mind determined to end corruptions.<br>
They will attain Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.8'></a>People blame one another,<br>
From time of old till now.<br>
They blame him who speaks much,<br>
They blame him who is reluctant to speak,<br>
And him who speaks in moderation;<br>
In the world none is not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.9'></a>One with a craving mind is unlike a noble one,<br>
Not being able to keep to the Middle.<br>
He either blames altogether or praises altogether;<br>
All in order to promote his own name.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.10'></a>He who is praised by the wise,<br>
Is to be regarded as virtuous.<br>
Such a man endowed with wisdom and precepts<br>
Is beyond any blame whatsoever.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.11'></a>He who is pure as a an arahat;<br>
Do not vilify him.<br>
He is praised by gods,<br>
As by Brahmā and Śakra.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.12'></a>Always guard and be cautious of your body,<br>
So as to be restrained from anger.<br>
Forsaking evil bodily acts,<br>
Advance in the practice of virtues.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.13'></a>Always guard and be cautious of your speech,<br>
So as to be restrained from anger.<br>
Forsaking speech of evil,<br>
Rehearse the words of Dharma.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.14'></a>Always guard and be cautious of your mind,<br>
So as to be restrained from anger.<br>
Forsaking evil thoughts in the mind,<br>
Meditate and be mindful of the Way.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.15'></a>He who is restrained in body and speech<br>
And who controls his mind;<br>
Giving up anger and practicing the Way,<br>
Is the strongest in forbearance.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.16'></a>Give up anger, renounce conceit<br>
And avoid all lustful cravings.<br>
Not clinging to the psycho-physical existence,<br>
And being unattached, one will end suffering.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.17'></a>He who removes anger the moment it arises;<br>
He who restrains from lust as it occurs;<br>
He who is heroic in renouncing ignorance;<br>
All these people will find happiness.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.18'></a>He who cuts off anger sleeps well,<br>
Hatred ceasing, there is no sorrow.<br>
Anger is the root of all poisons.<br>
A brahmin with a soft mind<br>
And good words will gain fame;<br>
[Anger] removed, there is no worry.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.19'></a>He who, together with other like-minded,<br>
Collaborates in evil doing;<br>
Company being parted, is left with anger,<br>
With which fire he torments himself.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.20'></a>He who knows no moral fear or shame,<br>
Who observes no precepts and is angry;<br>
Is dragged on by anger<br>
And never gets tired of the toil of existence.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.21'></a>The strong goes near [and clashes with] the warriors.<br>
Those without strength go near the weak.<br>
[But] endurance is indeed best;<br>
One should always endure the weak.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.22'></a>A person slighted by all<br>
Is endured by one with strength.<br>
For endurance is indeed best;<br>
One should always endure the weak.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.23'></a>We as much as others,<br>
Have great fear regarding three<br>
If we perceive the [mis-] deeds of others<br>
We should destroy [the fault] within ourselves.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.24'></a>Do things from the view-points of both:<br>
Ourselves as much as others.<br>
If we perceive the [mis-] deeds of others<br>
We should destroy [the faults] within ourselves.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.25'></a>The very wise excels the fools,<br>
Who utter abuse and evil words.<br>
He who wishes to win always,<br>
Should remain silent to [abusive] words.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns25.26'></a>The doers of evil<br>
Get retribution of anger for their anger,<br>
Those who reciprocate not anger with anger,<br>
Win over those defeated in clashes.</p>
