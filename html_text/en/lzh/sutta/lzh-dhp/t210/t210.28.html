<h1>28. The Path</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.1'></a>The best of paths is the eight-fold right [path]<br>
The Four-Truths are the track of Dharma<br>
The best of practices is the giving up of lust.<br>
The giving of lamps ensures the obtaining of eyes</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.2'></a>This is the Path, there is no more fear;<br>
When views are purified, one will transcend existence,<br>
This [Path] can crush Mara’s army;<br>
Walk on with effort to end suffering</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.3'></a>I have already opened up the Right Path,<br>
To fully display the unique splendour.<br>
Having heard it you must train yourself;<br>
Treading it leads to release from the evil bonds</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.4'></a>Phenomenal existence is impermanent and unsatisfactory;<br>
He who sees this is a wise one.<br>
If one wishes to be greed from unsatisfactoriness,<br>
Tread the Path, and it will all be removed</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.5'></a>Phenomenal existence is impermanent and empty.<br>
He who sees this is a wise one.<br>
One wishing to be freed from unsatisfactoriness,<br>
Has only to tread the Path with diligence</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.6'></a>One should get up when it’s time to do so<br>
Don’t be life the fools drowned in deep water,<br>
Who assemble with the lazy and indifferent,<br>
And feel too tired to advance on the Path</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.7'></a>Mindfulness of that to be mindful of is right,<br>
Mindfulness of that not to be mindful of is wrong.<br>
Be wise and don’t give rise to wrong [thoughts]<br>
Thoughts being rectified, the Goal will be reached</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.8'></a>Cautious in speech and watchful of the mind,<br>
And doing no bodily act which is unskillful<br>
—He who thus removes the threefold [unskillful] deeds<br>
The Buddha declares, has achieved the Goal</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.9'></a>If the tree is cut without being uprooted;<br>
The root still remaining, it will grow again.<br>
Remove the root, then there will be no tree,<br>
And the <i>bhikṣu</i> will gain Nirvāṇa</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.10'></a>So long as one cannot cut down the trees;<br>
There being mutual attachment between relations,<br>
One binds oneself with the greedy mind<br>
Like a calf after [the mother’s] milk</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.11'></a>He who can cut off the root of craving<br>
[The root of] the endless cycle of rebirths,<br>
Is said to be near the Way<br>
And will soon attain Nirvāṇa</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.12'></a>Lust results in aging;<br>
Hatred results in sickness;<br>
Delusion results in death;<br>
The three removed, one will reach the Goal.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.13'></a>Released at the beginning, released at the end,<br>
Released in the middle-one crosses to the other [shore]<br>
All thoughts having been extinguished,<br>
there will be no more old-age and death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.14'></a>To one entangled with wife and sons,<br>
Not contemplating on the ill [nature of] dharmas,<br>
Death will come abruptly,<br>
Like the rapid flow of flood waters.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.15'></a>Neither father nor son can save,<br>
What hope then from other kinsmen?<br>
To lean for support from kinsmen at life’s end,<br>
Is like a blind relying on a lamp.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.16'></a>The wise who understands this meaning,<br>
Should put into practice the sūtra and vinaya,<br>
Practicing diligently to transcend the world,<br>
And unsatisfactoriness will be completely removed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.17'></a>Get far away from the deep-water<br>
Like the wind banishing the clouds<br>
All conceptions having ceased;<br>
It is said to be the vision of wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.18'></a>Wisdom is the world’s foremost;<br>
[With it] one contentedly delights in the unconditioned,<br>
And knows the true teachings,<br>
Bringing an end to birth death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.19'></a>He who knows the conditioning to be empty,<br>
—This is seeing with wisdom—<br>
Becomes disgusted with worldly unsatisfactoriness;<br>
And from this Path [unsatisfactoriness] is removed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.20'></a>He who knows the conditioning to be unsatisfactory<br>
—This is seeing with wisdom—<br>
Becomes disgusted with worldly unsatisfactoriness;<br>
And from this Path [unsatisfactoriness] is removed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.21'></a>He who knows conditioning to be non-self<br>
—This is seeing with wisdom—<br>
Becomes disgusted with worldly unsatisfactoriness;<br>
And from this Path [unsatisfactoriness] is removed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.22'></a>I expound to you the Dharma,<br>
Having [myself once] been shot with the arrows of craving<br>
You should endeavor yourself<br>
And accept the Tathāgata’s words.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.23'></a>I am one who have completely destroyed [the defilement]<br>
And ended the coming and going—birth and death.<br>
*It is for the liberation of not [just] one single being,<br>
What has been expounded, the Path-eye.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.24'></a>Just as rivers flow into the sea,<br>
*And the water in turn flows on to quickly fill up.<br>
Therefore is [the Path] taught to the wise,<br>
By which they can be led to taking the amṛta.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.25'></a>The hitherto unheard of dharma-wheel<br>
[The Buddha] turned, out of compassion for beings.<br>
Those who devote themselves to Him<br>
Salute Him, and transcend the triple existence.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.26'></a>Three thoughts are to be cultivated; being skillful<br>
Three also are to be removed, being unskillful.<br>
From thoughts, there arises actions;<br>
These ceased, it is true abandonment.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.27'></a>Three meditations can transform thoughts.<br>
Give up attachment and practice the immeasurable.<br>
Attaining these three, three dens are removed.<br>
To be freed from the fetters, be mindful.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns28.28'></a>He who knows to restrain from evil with the precepts,<br>
Contemplative and wise, delighting in mindfulness,<br>
Has understood the arising and perishing of the world,<br>
His thoughts having ceased, he is liberated from all.</p>
