<h1>13. The Fools</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.1'></a>For the wakeful the night is long.<br>
For the weary, a journey is long.<br>
For the fools, the cycle of rebirths is long,<br>
Not knowing the True Dharma.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.2'></a>The fool’s deluded mind is always in darkness,<br>
Flowing on like a river.<br>
It’s better to fare on singly [than go with fools],<br>
Alone with no companions.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.3'></a>Falling into the company of fools<br>
Leads to sorrow for long.<br>
Living with fools is painful,<br>
Like being at enmity with oneself.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.4'></a>“I have sons, I have wealth”<br>
So thinking, the fool is perturbed.<br>
When even the self is not of one’s own,<br>
Whence sons and wealth?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.5'></a>“I in summer I shall stay here;<br>
In winter I shall stay here”<br>
Thus is the fool always apprehensive,<br>
Not knowing the changes in the future.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.6'></a>The fool, ignorant of his extreme folly,<br>
Claims himself to be wise.<br>
Being foolish and yet [claiming] to excel the wise<br>
—This is foolishness to the extreme.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.7'></a>A fool’s association with the wise<br>
Is like a ladle [being unable] to taste,<br>
Though he has taken liberties with [the wise] for long,<br>
He still remains ignorant of the Dharma.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.8'></a>An intelligent man’s association with the wise<br>
Is like the tongue tasting the flavor,<br>
Even if he just learns for a moment,<br>
He understands at once the essence of the Way.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.9'></a>A fool performs actions<br>
To incur troubles for himself.<br>
With a happy mind he does evil,<br>
Causing great sorrow [in future].</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.10'></a>The kind of action is not good,<br>
Which receding from it one will regret;<br>
With tears in the face<br>
[To receive] the fruit from one’s past practice.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.11'></a>The kind of action is virtuous and good,<br>
Which one will review happily;<br>
Being sure to receive good results,<br>
One is smilingly pleased with the practice.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.12'></a>So long as a past evil has not ripened,<br>
The fool is calm and at ease.<br>
When the time comes for it to ripen,<br>
He will experience much affliction.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.13'></a>The fool, looking from where he is,<br>
Sees not that he’s heading towards suffering.<br>
When he is about to fall into adversity,<br>
He’ll then realize that it’s not good.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.14'></a>When a fool does evil,<br>
He realizes not [its consequence].<br>
Troubles chase after him and he will burn himself<br>
—By his own evil, he is set ablaze.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.15'></a>The fool covets good food;<br>
Month after month his nourishment increases.<br>
Yet he is not even worth one-sixteenth.<br>
Of one who has comprehended the Dharma.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.16'></a>The mental preoccupation of a fool<br>
Will never yield any benefit.<br>
He is incurring punishment for himself;<br>
And retribution [is certain]—it has a seal.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.17'></a>One recognizes a fool by observing his situation:<br>
He gives not but seeks much;<br>
Where he falls into, there is no virtue or wisdom,<br>
But very often, evil deeds.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.18'></a>Those away from the Way and close to craving,<br>
Are [ordained] for food and for a name as a trainee.<br>
As they are greedy and cling to the household,<br>
They abundantly take offerings [from] other clans.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.19'></a>Don’t aspire ambivalently as a trainee:<br>
Don’t be a householder-renunciate<br>
Coveting the household goes against the Holy Teaching;<br>
And by so doing one will make oneself destitute.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.20'></a>To do so is to be on a par with the fools,<br>
And it only increases one’s craving and conceit<br>
—The aspiration for gain is one thing;<br>
The wish for Nirvāṇa is another.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns13.21'></a>Therefore, the knowledgeable ones<br>
Should go forth to be the Buddha’s disiples.<br>
Leaving behind lust and worldly practices,<br>
He’ll never get trapped in the cycle of rebirth.</p>
