<h1>18. Knives and Rods</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.1'></a>All are afraid of death.<br>
None does not fear the pain [inflicted with] rods.<br>
Just as you would forgive yourself,<br>
Don’t kill; don’t strike with rods.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.2'></a>He who ever cares for the well-being of creatures,<br>
And does not inflict pain on them;<br>
Will meet with no harm in this life,<br>
And be always well and happy hereafter.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.3'></a>Do not speak harsh words;<br>
He who speaks thus must fear retribution.<br>
Evil being done, disaster will follow,<br>
And knives and rods will come upon your body.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.4'></a>Be kind in uttering words,<br>
Like knocking at a gong [gently].<br>
When you dispute no more,<br>
You will transcend existence easily.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.5'></a>He who strikes the good ones with sticks,<br>
And vilifies those who are innocent;<br>
Will be retributed ten-fold with misfortune.<br>
Which will befall him promptly and inevitably.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.6'></a>[Firstly], severe pain while living;<br>
[Secondly], physical injury;<br>
[Thirdly], spontaneous illness;<br>
[Fourthly], mental disorder;</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.7'></a>[Fifthly], false accusation from others;<br>
[Sixthly], trouble from the magistrate;<br>
[Seventhly], destruction of assets;<br>
[Eighthly], separation from relatives;</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.8'></a>[Ninethly] His houses, and everything therein<br>
Being burnt away by fire;<br>
[Tenthly] Falling into hell at death.<br>
Such are the ten [misfortunes].</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.9'></a>Though one might go naked or shave one’s head,<br>
Or for life put on straw-clothes,<br>
Or bathe oneself [in sacred rivers] [or] squat on rocks,<br>
What use are these for [overcoming] one’s doubts?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.10'></a>He who neither strikes, kills nor burns,<br>
Nor seeks to be a winner;<br>
Who loves all living beings,<br>
Will meet with no enmity.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.11'></a>If there be a person in the world,<br>
Who knows to be shameful;<br>
He is one being induced to progress,<br>
Like a thoroughbred being whipped.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.12'></a>Like a fine horse when whipped,<br>
Advances far on the path.<br>
Even so a man endowed with faith, virtue,<br>
Mental concentration and vigour;<br>
Commits to the Path and accomplishes wisdom,<br>
Thereby eliminating all sufferings.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.13'></a>He who [though] well-adorned practices the dharma,<br>
Who restrains himself and upholds the pure life,<br>
Laying aside the cudgel towards all creatures,<br>
Is said to be a <i>śramaṇa</i>, a spiritual cultivator.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns18.14'></a>He who is harmless towards all creatures,<br>
Will never in his life be harmed,<br>
If he is always kind towards all,<br>
Who is there to be his enemy?</p>
