<h1>17. Evil Deeds</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.1'></a>He who does not follow suit on seeing good done,<br>
Will revert to follow his evil mind,<br>
He who does not seek to make merit properly<br>
Will reverse to delight in sexual misconduct.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.2'></a>The ordinary worldlings, when doing evil,<br>
Are not aware of [the danger involved].<br>
Being foolish, they find pleasure in it,<br>
And thereby accumulate poison for the future.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.3'></a>When a bad man does vices,<br>
He gets submerged in them again and again,<br>
Doing them with joyful desires.<br>
He receives accordingly the retribution of his evil.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.4'></a>When a good man does virtuous deeds<br>
[His virtues] increase progressively.<br>
Doing them with a willing mind,<br>
He receives accordingly the retribution of his merit.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.5'></a>[Though] the evil man might see as merit<br>
His evil, while it has not ripened;<br>
When his evil ripens,<br>
He will experience the result of his evil.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.6'></a>[Though] the virtuous man might see as evil<br>
His good deed, while it has not ripened;<br>
When his good deed ripens<br>
He will experience the blessing.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.7'></a>He who strikes others will be struck.<br>
He who hates others will be hated.<br>
He who abuses others will be abused.<br>
He who gets angry with others will get anger in return.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.8'></a>The worldlings have no learning,<br>
And do not understand the True Dharma.<br>
Our life here is short;<br>
How is it proper to do evil?</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.9'></a>Do not regard a tiny evil lightly,<br>
Thinking that it will bring no troubles.<br>
Water drops, though very tiny,<br>
Gradually fill up a big vessel:<br>
An evil is filled up,<br>
Bit by bit, to its accomplishment.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.10'></a>Do not regard a tiny good lightly,<br>
Thinking that it will bring no merit<br>
Water drops, though very tiny,<br>
Gradually fill up a big vessel:<br>
A merit is filed up,<br>
By accumulating from the tiniest.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.11'></a>When a man performs an action<br>
Whether it be a good or evil one;<br>
It is in each case for himself,<br>
And [its effect] is not obliterated at death.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.12'></a>He who is fond of taking [others’ things]<br>
May think that there’s nothing wrong with it;<br>
[But] if you take things belonging to others<br>
Others will also take your things.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.13'></a>Evil done does not immediately [bear fruits];<br>
As in milking a cow,<br>
Its retribution awaits in the nether world,<br>
As a fire concealed beneath ashes.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.14'></a>One may laugh in doing an evil;<br>
[But] having done it personally,<br>
One will cry in experiencing its retribution,<br>
When following one’s action the result of evil comes.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.15'></a>Doing evil, [the fool] does not rise up,<br>
As if he has been blocked by an army.<br>
On being dragged along, he then realizes,<br>
That he has fallen into evil practice.<br>
He subsequently suffers the result,<br>
Of what he has done earlier.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.16'></a>Like poison being rubbed into a wound<br>
Like a ship getting into an eddy,<br>
When evil deeds multiply<br>
They do harm to all.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.17'></a>He who falsely accuses one<br>
Who is pure and unsullied<br>
Harm will bounce back to this fool,<br>
Like dust thrown against the wind.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.18'></a>Committing a mistake is not [necessarily] evil.<br>
It becomes good when one repents subsequently.<br>
Such a person illuminates the world,<br>
Like the unclouded sun.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.19'></a>Whatever act a man has done,<br>
He will himself witness [the result]:<br>
A good act yields good [result],<br>
An evil act yields bad [result].</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.20'></a>The consciousness of some enter the womb:<br>
The evil ones are born in hells:<br>
The doers of good ascend to heavens.<br>
Those unattached to existence attain Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.21'></a>Neither in the sky, nor in mid-ocean<br>
Nor hiding places in the mountains and rocks<br>
No place is to be found here<br>
To escape the misfortune resulting from evil deed.</p>
<p><a class='vgns' id='vgns17.22'></a>All beings are [similarly] afflicted:<br>
Not being able to escape old-age and death.<br>
Only the kind and wise [are spared].<br>
Not being bent on wrong and evil like others.</p>
