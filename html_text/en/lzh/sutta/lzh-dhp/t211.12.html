<h1>12. Flowers (pupphavaggo)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='be' id='be1'></a>In days of old, when Buddha was residing at Śrāvastī, there was to the south-east of that country, in the mid-ocean, a certain islet (a mound, or fort, or look-out), on the top of which was a tree that bare beautiful scented flowers.<br>
In the same spot dwelt five hundred women of the Brahman caste, wholly devoted to their worldly duties, ignorant that there was a Buddha born in the world. Now these women were in the habit of conversing together on the unhappiness of their worldly condition, and in consequence they used to go to the tree that surmounted their abode, and pluck the flowers and offer them to Brahmā-deva, with the prayer that they might escape the power of Yama, and be born in heaven (Brahma-heaven). Now Buddha, perceiving their case, and knowing that they had the capacity of being converted, suddenly transported himself with his followers to their place of abode, and then came and sat down near them. The women seeing the wonderful sight, were lost in amazement, and exclaimed, “Brahmā himself has come to answer our prayers!” But on this a certain Deva answered them, and said, “This is not Brahmā, but the World-honoured Buddha, who has come to save the world.” On this the women bowed down in reverence, and addressed Buddha in these words—"We, indeed, are but women, much polluted, yet we desire, above all things, to escape the power of Yama, and to be born in the highest heaven;” to whom Buddha replied, “May you, indeed, obtain your desire! But there are two things in the world which are immutably fixed—that good actions bring happiness, and bad actions result in misery. But (it is not generally known that) the joys of heaven as well as the sorrows of earth are both to be avoided. Who, then, is able to pluck and to hold the true joy of perfect rest (the rest of non-action)? Truly ye have understanding, O women!” and therefore he recited these gāthas:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Who is able to select (conquer?) the earth <span class='add'>(i.e., the place of his abode)</span>, to escape Yama, and lay hold of heaven? Who (is able) to repeat the verses of the Law as one who selects choice (excellent) flowers? The enlightened (one) selects the earth, avoids Yama, seizes heaven, illustriously repeats the verses of the Law, is able to cull the flowers of virtue. Knowing that the world is like a hillock of sand, that it is unsubstantial as a mirage, he separates the flowery arrows of Māra, and escapes from the necessity of birth and death. Regarding the body as a bubble, as a self-created mirage, he separates the flowery garland of Māra, and escapes from birth and death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the 500 women were converted, and, in reply to Ānanda, Buddha explains how these women had formerly lived in the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, and because of their devotion to him, were now privileged to live in the time of Śākya Buddha, and to be converted by him. And so on another occasion Buddha recited these gāthas:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“As many kinds of flowers when waived to and fro scatter their scent far and wide, so wide is the renown of his accumulated merits, who once is born and lives as he ought. The scent of the Vassikī flowers does not travel against the wind, but the (odour) of those who live religiously spreads far and wide—the fame of the virtuous man pervades all places. The scent of sandal-wood and the Tagara, of the Lotus and Vassikī flower, although real and sensible, is not as the fragrance of (him who walks according to) the precepts. Mean and false in comparison is the scent of the rarest flowers with the fame of him who holds by virtue, the excellency of whose conduct rises to heaven. He who thus lives in perfect agreement with the precepts, who walks circumspectly, and who by fixed thought has obtained release, he has far out-distanced the way of Māra.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on another occasion, when Buddha was residing on the Gridhrakūta Mountain, near Rājagriha, he recited the following gāthas:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“As a ditch in the field, close beside the highway, will produce the lily in its midst, and spread far and wide its delightful perfume, so in the midst of life and death (that is, the phenomenal world), beside the way of false speculation (universal inquiry), the wise man diffuses his glad sentiments in becoming a disciple of Buddha.”</p>
