<h1>14. The wise man (panditavaggo)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='be' id='be1'></a>There was in old time a Brahmachārin just twenty years of age, who, being possessed of brilliant talent, foolishly thought that he could be instructed in no art or accomplishment common in the world. Taking his travels, therefore, he came to a country where he saw a fletcher making his arrows and shaping his bow; on seeing which he was convinced of his ignorance in this respect; and so also in another country, seeing a man building a ship, he was equally convinced; and so again when in another place he saw a man making a royal palace. Having learnt all these arts, and passed successively through sixteen countries, he came back to his own place, and boastfully asked, “Who is there in the world more acquainted with the arts than myself?”<br>
Buddha perceiving his capacity for conversion, changed himself into a Shaman, and coming where he resided, with his robes orderly arranged, and his begging-dish in his hands, stood before him. “And who are you?” said the Brahmachārin. “I am a man able to govern his body,” replied the Shaman. “And what is that? “inquired the other, on which the Shaman uttered these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The fletcher carves and adjusts the horn of which his bow is made; the pilot manages his ship; the architect hews his beams; the wise man governs his body (himself). For as, by way of simile, the solid rock is unshaken by the wind, so the wise man, grave of thought, quails not whether praised or blamed: just as a deep lake (is not easily stirred but remain) tranquil and still, so the wise man hearing the Law (way), his heart is quiet and at rest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Shaman having recited these verses, by his supernatural power raised himself in the air, and exhibited the thirty-two superior signs of Buddha's person, on which the Brahmachārin was converted, and obtained the fruit of Rahatship.</p>
<p><a class='be' id='be2'></a>In old times, when Buddha was residing in Śrāvastī, there was a village about 500 li off, in which dwelt some fifty or sixty families (mountain people). Amongst these there was a certain poor man and his wife, to whom had been born two boys (twins), very lovely to behold, and of incomparable grace. The one they called “Grace" (tih), the other “Fortunate" (fuh). Now it so happened one day the father had returned from his work, and lain down on his bed to rest, whilst the mother was still in the fields. The two children, who were then only seven or eight weeks old, not seeing their father, began to speak reproachfully one with the other, because they were born in such circumstances as they were, and had to fare so badly as they did. The father, overwhelmed with astonishment at hearing the children talking thus, and thinking that they were demons in human shape, resolved to kill them and burn their bodies. Accordingly, he went out into the fields to gather wood for the purpose, and meeting his wife he told her all about it. On this the mother, moved with pity, and scarce believing the truth of the matter, begged a respite for the children for a few days. On the morrow she herself went outside the dwelling and listened, when lo! she heard the children reproaching one another as before. On this, being persuaded that they were demons in children's form, she consented to the course usual in these cases, that they should be burned (either “burned alive,” or “killed and burned"). At this time Buddha, knowing the circumstances of the case, transported himself to the village, and, resplendent with glory, lit up the place and all the surrounding country with the brightness of his presence. On this the villagers, and especially the parents of the children, came near to worship him. On seeing the parents, and hearing their account of the children, Buddha smiled, and from his mouth proceeded the five-coloured rays that shone through heaven and earth, and then he related the history of the twins, how that they had been disciples of Kāśyapa Buddha, and were in a fair way to arrive at perfect deliverance, when by mutual conversation on heretical doctrines they had hindered their escape, and had continued to be born, at one time in high degree, at another time in poverty, and at last as the twins of the poor people before him; and then the World-honoured recited these gāthas:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The great man is entirely free from covetous desire—he dwells in a place of light himself enlightened. Although perchance he meet with sorrow, he rejoices; without ostentation, he exhibits his wisdom. The wise man (bhadra) concerns himself with no worldly business; he desires neither wealth, children, or possessions (land), always carefully observing the precepts, and walking in the way of supreme wisdom, he hankers not after strange doctrine (or wealth or honour). The wise man, knowing the character of instability, as a tree in the midst of sand (uses every effort) to change his friend whose mind is unfixed, and to bring him back from impurity to virtue (purity).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On hearing: these lines, the children were able to enter as Samaneras into the assembly, and the parents and other villagers entered the paths.</p>
