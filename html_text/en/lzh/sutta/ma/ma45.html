<h1>45. Shame and Conscience</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard:</span> One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk has no conscience and no modesty, then that’s detrimental to affection and respect. If he has no affection and respect, then that’s detrimental to his faith. If he doesn’t have faith, then that’s detrimental to right thinking. If he doesn’t have right thinking, then that’s detrimental to right mindfulness and right knowledge. If he doesn’t have right mindfulness and right knowledge, then that’s detrimental to guarding his faculties, guarding the precepts, not having regrets, gladness, joy, calm, happiness, concentration, seeing as it really is and knowing as it truly is, disenchantment, lack of desire, and liberation. If he doesn’t have liberation, then that’s detrimental to nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“If a monk has conscience and has modesty, he readily cultivates affection and respect. If he has affection and respect, he readily cultivates his faith. If he has faith, he readily cultivates right thinking. If he has right thinking, he readily cultivates right mindfulness and right knowledge. If he has right mindfulness and right knowledge, he readily cultivates guarding his faculties, guarding the precepts, not having regrets, gladness, joy, calm, happiness, concentration, seeing as it really is and knowing as it truly is, disenchantment, lack of desire, and liberation. If he has liberation, he readily cultivates nirvāṇa.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
