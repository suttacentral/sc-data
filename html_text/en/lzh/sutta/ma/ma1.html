<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard:</span> One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If a monk accomplishes seven things, then he will attain the happiness of the noble ones, and he’ll be rightly headed for the end of the contaminants. What are the seven? Namely, a monk knows the Dharma, knows the meaning, knows the time, knows moderation, knows himself, knows the assembly, and knows the superiority of people.</p>

<h2>Knowing the Superiority of People</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“How does a monk know the superiority of people? It means a monk knows there are two kinds of people: believers and non-believers. If someone is a believer, he is superior; a non-believer is not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of believers: those who frequently go to see the monks and those who don’t frequently go to see the monks. If someone frequently goes to see the monks, he is superior; someone who doesn’t frequently go to see the monks is not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who frequently go to see the monks: those who revere the monks and those who don’t revere the monks. If someone reveres the monks, he is superior; someone who doesn’t revere the monks is not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who revere the monks: those who have questions about the sūtras and those who don’t have questions about the sūtras.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who ask about the sūtras: those who single-mindedly listen to the sūtras and those who don’t single-mindedly listen to the sūtras. If someone single-mindedly listens to the sūtras, he is superior; someone who doesn’t single-mindedly listen to the sūtras is not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who single-mindedly listen to the sūtras: those who hear and retain the Dharma and those who hear but don’t retain the Dharma. If someone hears and retains the Dharma, he is superior; someone who hears but doesn’t retain the Dharma is not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who hear and retain the Dharma: those who hear the Dharma and contemplate its meaning and those who hear the Dharma but don’t contemplate its meaning. If someone hears the Dharma and contemplates its meaning, he is superior; someone who hears the Dharma but doesn’t contemplate its meaning is not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who hear the Dharma and contemplate its meaning: those who know the Dharma, know its meaning, go from one teaching to the next teaching, conform to the Dharma, and conduct themselves according to the Dharma and those who don’t know the Dharma, don’t know its meaning, don’t go from one teaching to the next teaching, don’t conform to the Dharma, and don’t conduct themselves according to the Dharma. If someone knows the Dharma, knows its meaning, goes from one teaching to the next teaching, conforms to the Dharma, and conducts himself according to the Dharma, he is superior. Someone who doesn’t know the Dharma, doesn’t know its meaning, doesn’t go from one teaching to the next teaching, doesn’t conform to the Dharma, and doesn’t conduct himself according to the Dharma is not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>“It also means that there are two kinds of people who know the Dharma, know its meaning, go from one teaching to the next teaching, conform to the Dharma, and conduct themselves according to the Dharma: those who benefit themselves, benefit others, benefit many people, pity the world,<a class='t' id='t422a' href='#t422a'>T 422a</a> seek both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and seek peace and happiness and those who don’t benefit themselves, don’t benefit others, don’t benefit many people, don’t pity the world, don’t seek both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and don’t seek peace and happiness. If someone benefits himself, benefits others, benefits many people, pities the world, seeks both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and seeks peace and happiness, this person is the very best among people. He is great, higher, exceptional, superior, honored, and marvelous.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>“It’s just as there’s milk because of the cow, cream because of milk, butter because of cream, refined butter because of butter, and ghee because of refined butter. Ghee is the very best of those things. It’s great, higher, exceptional, superior, honored, and marvelous. Such is the person who benefits himself, benefits others, benefits many people, pities the world, seeks both meaning and benefit for gods and humans, and seeks peace and happiness. Of these pairs of people as they’ve been described, as they’ve been discerned, and as they’ve been defined, he is the best, great, higher, exceptional, superior, honored, and marvelous. This is called a monk who knows the superiority of people.”</p>
