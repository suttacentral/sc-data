<h1>11. The Rock Salt Parable</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard:</span> One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “It’s according to the actions that a person does that they receive their rewards. Thus, one who doesn’t practice the religious life will not attain the end of suffering. Suppose someone says, ‘It’s according to the actions that a person does that they receive their rewards.’ Thus, cultivating the religious life leads to the end of suffering.</p>
<h2>The Parable of the Salt Rocks</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Why is that? Suppose someone commits an action that’s not good and surely will receive a painful result, the reward of Hell. How does a person commit an action that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, the reward of Hell? It means that this person hasn’t cultivated themselves. They haven’t cultivated the precepts, haven’t cultivated their mind, and haven’t cultivated wisdom. Their life span will be quite short. This is called a person who commits an action that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, the reward of Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“It’s like when a person tosses a couple rocks of salt into a little water wanting to make the water too salty to drink. What do you think? Can those rocks of salt make the water too salty to drink?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The monks answered, “So it is, Bhagavān. Why is that? Those rocks of salt are much, and the water is little, so they can make the water too salty to drink.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Thus, someone commits an action that’s not good and surely will receive a painful result, the reward of Hell.

They have cultivated the precepts, cultivated their mind, and cultivated wisdom. Their life span will be quite long. This is called a person who commits an action that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, a reward in the present.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“It’s like when a person tosses a couple rocks of salt into the Gaṅgā River wanting to make the water too salty to drink. What do you think? Can those rocks of salt make the Gaṅgā River too salty to drink?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The monks answered, “No, Bhagavān. Why is that? The Gaṅgā River is large, and a couple rocks of salt are little, so they cannot make it too salty to drink.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Thus, someone commits an action that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, a reward in the present.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“It’s like a person who steals another’s sheep. How does someone steal another’s sheep? It means that the sheep thief is either a king or a king’s minister who is powerful, and the sheep owner is poor and powerless. Because they are powerless, the owner looks hopeful in various ways, even folding their hands and seeking to inquire. They say, ‘Good man, could you see that the sheep return or see that they are given back?’ This is called someone who steals another’s sheep.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“It’s like when a person owes five coins to another, and they are arrested by that creditor. Even if it were just one coin, they still would be arrested by that creditor. How is it that a person who owes five coins to another is arrested by that creditor, and even if it were just one coin, they still would be arrested by that creditor?
