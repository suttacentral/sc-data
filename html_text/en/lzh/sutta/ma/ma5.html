<h1>5. The Wood Pile Parable</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard:</span>One time, the Buddha traveled to Kośala and was among the people there. He traveled with an assembly of great monks and followers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān suddenly saw from the road a place where there was a large wood pile engulfed in flames. After he saw this, the Bhagavān went down to the side of the road, spread out his sitting mat by a tree, and sat down cross-legged.</p>
<h2>1. The Burning Wood Pile and the Young Woman</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>After he had sat down, the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Do all of you see that large wood pile engulfed in flames?”</p>
<p>The monks then answered, “We see it, Bhagavān!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose you were to embrace, sit, or lie with that large wood pile engulfed in flames. Suppose it were an warrior woman or a priest, householder, or worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry, and you were to embrace, sit, or lie down with her. Which would be pleasant?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The monks then said, “Bhagavān, that large wood pile is engulfed in flames. If we embraced, sat, or lie with it, that would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose it were a warrior woman or a priest, householder, or worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry. To embrace, sit, or lie with her would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='t' id='t425b' href='#t425b'>T 425b</a>The Bhagavān told them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee ascetics will not lose the ascetic path. Those of you who want to achieve the unsurpassed religious practice should rather embrace that wood pile engulfed in flames. If you sit or lie down there, even though it will cause you to suffer pain or die, you won’t be destined to go to a bad place or be born in hell after your body breaks up and your life ends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“If a foolish man violates the precepts and doesn’t make effort, that creates bad and unwholesome things. His is not the religious practice, but he calls it the religious practice. He’s not an ascetic, but he’s called an ascetic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Suppose he were to embrace an warrior woman or a priest, householder, or worker woman in the prime of life who is clean and perfumed, wearing bright and pure clothing, and whose body is adorned with flowers and jewelry, or suppose he were to sit or lie down with her. That foolish man’s long night will be neither good nor purposeful as a result, which brings the results of bad things. He’ll be destined to go to a bad place or be born in hell when his body breaks up and his life ends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Therefore, all of you must examine your own goal, examine the goals of others, and examine the goals of both. You must think, ‘My training as a renunciant is neither vain nor empty; it has its fruit and its result. There is an utmost happiness, birth in good places, and attainment of a long life. I accept the faithful gifts of others for clothing, food and drink, bed and bedding, and bathing and medicine. It will cause my benefactors to obtain great fortune, obtain great rewards, and obtain great radiance.’ You must perform your training.”</p>
<h2>2. The Hair Rope and the Massage</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who tightly wraps a cord of hair rope around your calf and twists it until it cuts your skin. After cutting skin, it cuts your flesh. After cutting flesh, it cuts your tendons. After cutting tendons, it cuts your bone. After cutting bone, it reaches your marrow and stops. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker who massages your body, limbs, hands, and feet. Which would be pleasant?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man tightly wrapped a cord of hair rope around our calves and twisted it until it cut our skin, cut our flesh after cutting skin, cut our tendons after cutting flesh, cut our bones after cutting tendons, cut our marrow after cutting bones, and stopped, that would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker who massages our body, limbs, hands, and feet. That would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>The Bhagavān told them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee ascetics will not lose the ascetic path. Those of you who want to achieve the unsurpassed religious practice should rather allow a strong man to tightly wrap a cord of hair rope around your calf and twist it until it cuts your skin, cuts your flesh after cutting skin, cuts your tendons after cutting flesh, cuts your bone after cutting tendons, cuts your marrow after cutting bone, and stops. Even though it will cause you to suffer pain or die, you won’t be destined to go to a bad place or <a class='t' id='t425c' href='#t425c'>T 425c</a>be born in hell after your body breaks up and your life ends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“If a foolish man violates the precepts and doesn’t make effort, that creates bad and unwholesome things. His is not the religious practice, but he calls it the religious practice. He’s not an ascetic, but he’s called an ascetic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Accepting a faithful gift from an warrior, priest, householder, or worker who massages his body, limbs, hands, and feet, that foolish man’s long night will be neither good nor purposeful as a result, which brings the results of bad things. He’ll be destined to go to a bad place or be born in hell when his body breaks up and his life ends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Therefore, all of you must examine your own goal, examine the goals of others, and examine the goals of both. You must think, ‘My training as a renunciant is neither vain nor empty; it has its fruit and its result. There is an utmost happiness, birth in good places, and attainment of a long life.

It will cause my benefactors to obtain great fortune, obtain great rewards, and obtain great radiance.’ You must perform your training.”</p>
<h2>3. The Sword and Veneration</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who uses a brightly polished and sharpened sword to chop off your <span class='add'>leg at the</span> hip. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker who venerates, respects, and looks after you. Which would be pleasant?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man used a brightly polished and sharpened sword to chop off our <span class='add'>legs at the</span> hip, that would be very painful. Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker who venerates, respects, and looks after us. That would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>The Bhagavān told them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee ascetics will not lose the ascetic path.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“Accepting a faithful gift from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker who venerates, respects, and looks after him, that foolish man’s long night will be neither good nor purposeful as a result, which brings the results of bad things. He’ll be destined to go to a bad place or be born in hell when his body breaks up and his life ends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“Therefore, all of you must examine your own goal, examine the goals of others, and examine the goals of both. You must think, ‘My training as a renunciant is neither vain nor empty; it has its fruit and its result. There is an utmost happiness, birth in good places, and attainment of a long life.

<h2>4. The Hot Iron Sheet and Clothing</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, <a class='t' id='t426a' href='#t426a'>T 426a</a>“What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who wraps an iron or copper sheet that’s both glowing and flaming around your body. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift of clothing from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker. Which would be pleasant?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man wrapped an iron or copper sheet that’s both glowing and flaming around our bodies, that would be very painful.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>The Bhagavān told them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee ascetics will not lose the ascetic path.

<h2>5. The Hot Iron Ball and Delicious Meal</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who opens your mouth with hot iron forceps and then puts in an iron ball that’s both glowing and flaming. That hot iron ball burns your lips. After it burns your lips, it burns your tongue. After it burns your tongue, it burns your gums. After it burns your gums, it burns your throat. After it burns your throat, it burns your heart. After it burns your heart, it burns your intestines and stomach. After it burns your intestines and stomach, it falls through <span class='add'>to the ground</span>. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift of food with measureless flavors from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker. Which would be pleasant?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man opened our mouths with hot iron forceps and then put in an iron ball that’s both glowing and flaming, that hot iron ball would burn our lips.

Bhagavān, suppose we were to accept a faithful gift of food with measureless flavors from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker. That would be very pleasant, Bhagavān.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>The Bhagavān told them, “I will explain this for you, so you trainee ascetics will not lose the ascetic path.

<h2>6. The Hot Iron Bed and the Sofa</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who forces a servant to sit or lie on an iron or copper bed that’s both glowing and flaming. Suppose you were to accept a faithful gift of a bed or sofa to lie on from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker. Which would be pleasant?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a>The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man forced a servant to sit or lie on an iron or copper bed that’s both glowing and flaming, that would be very painful.

<h2>7. The Hot Caldron and the Private Dwelling</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc40' href='#sc40'>SC 40</a>The Bhagavān again addressed the monks, “What do you think? Suppose there’s a strong man who picks up a person and puts them headfirst into a large iron or copper cauldron that’s both glowing and flaming. Suppose you were to accept the faithful gift of a dwelling from a warrior, priest, householder, or worker, and it’s coated with whitewash, its windows and doors are secure and private, and it has a fireplace for warmth. Which would be pleasant?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc41' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a>The monks then said, “Bhagavān, if a strong man picked up a person and put them headfirst into a large iron or copper caldron that’s both glowing and flaming, that would be very painful.

I accept the faithful gifts of others for clothing, food and drink, bed and bedding, and bathing and medicine. It will cause my benefactors to obtain great fortune, obtain great rewards, and obtain great radiance.’ You must perform your training.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a>When he spoke this teaching, the contaminants ended for 60 monks, and they were freed from the bonds. 60 monks renounced the precepts and returned home. Why is that? The Bhagavān’s instructions were extremely profound and difficult. The path of training was also extremely profound and difficult.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
