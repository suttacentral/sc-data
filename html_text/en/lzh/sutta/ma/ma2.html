<h1>2. The Pārijāta Tree</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard:</span> One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada Park in Jeta Grove.</p>
<h2>The Seasons of the Pārijāta Tree</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “If the leaves of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree  wither and yellow, then the Trāyastriṃśa gods  are delighted and rejoice. It won’t be long before the pārijāta tree’s leaves will fall.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Furthermore, once the leaves of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree have fallen, then the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice. It won’t be long before the pārijāta tree’s leaves will grow back.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Furthermore, once the leaves of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree have grown back, then the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice. It won’t be long before the pārijāta tree grows webs <span class='add'>of buds</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Furthermore, once the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree has grown webs, then the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice. It won’t be long before the pārijāta tree’s <span class='add'>buds</span> grow like bird beaks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='t' id='t422b' href='#t422b'>T 422b</a> “Furthermore, once the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree has grown <span class='add'>buds</span> like bird beaks, then the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice. It won’t be long before the pārijāta tree’s <span class='add'>buds</span> will open like bowls.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Furthermore, once the <span class='add'>buds</span> of Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree have opened like bowls, then the Trāyastriṃśa gods are delighted and rejoice. It won’t be long before the pārijāta tree will be in full bloom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Once the pārijāta tree has fully bloomed, the light that it shines, the color that it reflects, and the fragrance that it produces have a range of a hundred leagues. During the fourth month of summer, the Trāyastriṃśa gods then entertain themselves with the five heavenly pleasures and the virtues with which they’re endowed. This is called the festival under the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree.</p>
<h2>The Seasons of the Noble Disciple</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“This meaning is also the case for the noble disciple. When he considers leaving home, then the disciple is called ‘leaves turning yellow.’ He’s like the withering and yellowing leaves of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Furthermore, when he shaves off his beard and hair, puts on reddish-brown robes, becomes faithful, leaves home, goes homeless, and trains on the path, the noble disciple then is called ‘falling leaves.’ He’s like the leaves falling from the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Furthermore, he parts with desire and parts with bad and unwholesome things. With perception and contemplation, this seclusion produces joy and happiness, and he attains the accomplishment of the first meditation. The noble disciple then is called ‘leaves growing back.’ He’s like the leaves growing back on the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Furthermore, once perception and contemplation have stopped, the noble disciple possesses an inner stillness and unified mind. Without perception or contemplation, this concentration produces joy and happiness, and he attains the accomplishment of the second meditation. The noble disciple then is called ‘growing webs <span class='add'>of buds</span>.’ He’s like the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree growing webs <span class='add'>of buds</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Furthermore, the noble disciple parts with joy and desire, and he is equanimous without further pursuit. With right mindfulness and right knowledge, he personally experiences the happiness, which is described by the noble ones as the noble’s equanimity, mindfulness, happy abiding, and emptiness. He attains the accomplishment of the third meditation. The noble disciple then is called ‘growing <span class='add'>buds</span> like bird beaks.’ He’s like the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree growing <span class='add'>buds</span> like bird beaks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Furthermore, the noble disciple’s pleasure ceases and his pain ceases. The basis of joy and sorrow having ceased, he is neither discomforted nor delighted. Equanimous, mindful, and pure, he attains the accomplishment of the fourth meditation. The noble disciple then is called ‘becoming like a bowl.’ He’s like the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree <span class='add'>buds</span> becoming like bowls.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Furthermore, once the noble disciple’s contaminants have ended, his mind is liberated, and his wisdom is liberated. In the present life, he knows and recognizes for himself the accomplishment of self-realization: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.’ He is no longer subject to existence and knows it as it really is. The noble disciple then is called ‘in full bloom.’ He’s like the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree in full bloom.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“He is an arhat monk whose contaminants have ended. The Trāyastriṃśa gods assemble in the Sudharmā Assembly Hall, sigh admiringly, and praise him, ‘Some worthy disciple at some town<a class='t' id='t422c' href='#t422c'>T 422c</a> shaved off his beard and hair, put on reddish-brown robes, became faithful, left home, went homeless, and trained on the path. Once his contaminants had ended, his mind was liberated, and his wisdom was liberated. In the present life, he knew and recognized for himself the accomplishment of self-realization: “Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, and the task has been accomplished.” He is no longer subject to existence and knows it as it really is.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“This is called the assembly that coincides with the end of an arhat’s contaminants, which is like the festival held under the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven’s pārijāta tree.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
