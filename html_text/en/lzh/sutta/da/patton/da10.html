  <h1>Going Up to Ten</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to Aṅga accompanied by a large group of 1,250 monks. They went to the city of Campā and stayed near Lake Gargarā.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>On the fifteenth-day full moon, the Bhagavān sat in an open area with a large assembly surrounding him. After teaching the Dharma all night, he addressed Śāriputra, “The monks have gathered today from the four directions. They’ve all diligently shaken off their sleepiness and want to listen to a Dharma teaching, but I’m suffering from back pain. I’m going to take a break. You can teach the Dharma for the monks now.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Śāriputra accepted the Buddha’s instruction. The Bhagavān then folded his outer robe four times and laid on his right side like a lion with his feet together.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The senior Śāriputra then addressed the monks, “I will teach the Dharma now. Its words are true in the beginning, middle, and end, its content and meaning are complete, and it purifies the religious life. All of you, listen closely, and consider it well. I will teach it for you.”</p>
<p>The monks accepted his instructions and listened.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Śāriputra told the monks, “There are teachings that go up to ten which remove the manifold bonds, reach Nirvāṇa, and completely end suffering. They also perfect 550 things. Now, I will discern them. All of you, listen well!</p>

What are the five? <span class='add'>[1]</span> If a monk hears the Buddha teach Dharma, hears a teaching by a religious practitioner, or hears a teaching by a senior teacher, he considers, investigates, and discerns the teaching and its meaning, and his heart rejoices. Once he rejoices, he gains a love of Dharma. Once he gains a love of Dharma, his body and mind become peaceful. Once his body and mind are peaceful, he attains samādhi. Once he attains samādhi, he attains true knowledge. This is the first entry to liberation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc42'>SC 42</a>“<span class='add'>[2]</span> Likewise, a monk who rejoices upon hearing the teaching does so when accepting, retaining, and reciting it. <span class='add'>[3]</span> He rejoices when explaining it for other people. <span class='add'>[4]</span> He rejoices when considering and discerning it. <span class='add'>[5]</span> He also rejoices when he attains samādhi with the teaching.</p>

The five spheres of escape: <span class='add'>[1]</span> First, A monk doesn’t enjoy, give attention to, or befriend desires. He’s only mindful of escaping them and enjoys being far from them. He befriends non-negligence and disciplines his mind. Escaping and being free of desires, the arising of contaminants caused by those desires is also entirely abandoned and ceased, and he becomes liberated. This is the escape from desire. <em><span class='add'>[2]</span> The escape from anger, <span class='add'>[3]</span> escape from jealousy, <span class='add'>[4]</span> escape from form, and <span class='add'>[5]</span> escape from belief in the individual are likewise.</em></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a>“What are five things to be realized? The five collections of the adept: the adept’s collection of precepts, collection of samādhi, collection of wisdom, collection of liberation, and collection of knowing and seeing liberation.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>“What are six things to know? The six spheres of escape: <span class='add'>[1]</span> Suppose a monk says, ‘I’d cultivate kindness, but then I become angry.’ The other monks say, ‘Don’t say that! Don’t misrepresent the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata doesn’t say, “I’d like to cultivate the liberation of kindness, but then notions of anger arise.” That’s impossible. The Buddha says, “Once anger is gone, then one becomes kind afterward.”’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc61'>SC 61</a>“Suppose a monk says, <span class='add'>[2]</span> ‘I’d practice the liberation of compassion, but then I have hateful thoughts.’… <span class='add'>[3]</span> ‘practice the liberation of joy, but then I have sorrowful thoughts.’ … <span class='add'>[4]</span> ‘practice the liberation of equanimity, but then I have thoughts of like or dislike.’ … <span class='add'>[5]</span> ‘cultivate the practice of non-self, but then I have suspicious thoughts’ … <span class='add'>[6]</span> ‘cultivate the practice without conception, but then I have many distracting notions.’ <em>Those cases are likewise.</em></p>
