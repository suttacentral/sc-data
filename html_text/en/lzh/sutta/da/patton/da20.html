  <h1>Ambāṣṭha</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to Kośala accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks. They went to the Kośala priest village of Icchānaṅgala and stopped to rest in a citron grove.</p>
<h3>Puṣkarasārin Sends Ambāṣṭha to Meet the Buddha</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>The priest Puṣkarasārin had stopped in the village of Utkaṭa, which was bountiful and thriving. King Prasenajit had bestowed this village to Puṣkarasārin as the priest’s due. This priest was descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine <span class='add'>[priests]</span>, so he wasn’t slighted by others. He had mastered the three Vedas and could discern all the various kinds of scriptures. He was also skilled in the techniques of <span class='add'>[recognizing]</span> the great man’s signs and <span class='add'>[performing]</span> sacrifices and rituals. He had 500 disciples whom he taught without exception.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>His best student disciple, named Ambāṣṭha, was descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine <span class='add'>[priests]</span>, so he wasn’t slighted by others. He had mastered the three Vedas and could discern all the various kinds of scriptures. He was also skilled in the techniques of <span class='add'>[recognizing]</span> the great man’s signs and <span class='add'>[performing]</span> sacrifices and rituals. He had 500 student disciples as well whom he taught without exception, the same as his teacher.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The priest Puṣkarasārin heard: “The ascetic Gautama of the Śākya clan, who had left home and achieved awakening, has arrived at the Kośala priest village of Icchānaṅgala and stopped to rest in a citron grove. He’s accompanied by a large assembly of 1,250 monks and possesses a great reputation that’s heard throughout the world: ‘He’s a Tathāgata, an Arhat, and a Completely Awakened One who has perfected the ten epithets. Among gods, worldly men, and demons, whether they’re Māra and the gods or ascetics and priests, he’s self-realized and teaches the Dharma for others. It’s good in the beginning, middle, and end, complete in content and expression, and purifies the religious life.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><span class='add'>[Puṣkarasārin said:]</span> “Since he’s a realized person, I should go and meet him! Now, I’d like to examine that ascetic Gautama to be certain he has the 32 signs. His name is heard everywhere, but is what they say about him true? Is there some way I could see the Buddha’s signs?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Again, he thought, “Now, my disciple Ambāṣṭha is descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine <span class='add'>[priests]</span>, so he’s not slighted by others. He has mastered the three Vedas and can discern all the various kinds of scriptures. He’s also skilled in the techniques of <span class='add'>[recognizing]</span> the great man’s signs and <span class='add'>[performing]</span> sacrifices and rituals. I can just send this man to examine the Buddha; he’ll recognize if he possesses the signs or not.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>The priest then summoned Ambāṣṭha and told him, “Go examine that ascetic Gautama and determine if he has the 32 signs or if he is a fake.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>Ambāṣṭha then asked his teacher, “How will I examine Gautama’s signs and know if he is a fake?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>His teacher replied, “Now, I’ll tell you: If he has perfected the 32 signs of a great man, he’s certain to arrive at <span class='add'>[one of]</span> two places, without a doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“If he stays at home, he’ll become a wheel-turning noble king, a king who rules over the world’s four quarters, educating the people and managing the affairs of state with the Dharma. He’ll be endowed with seven treasures: 1. The golden wheel treasure, 2. the white elephant treasure, 3. the blue horse treasure, 4. the magic jewel treasure, 5. the beautiful woman treasure, 6. the householder treasure, and 7. the general treasure. That king will have a thousand sons who are courageous and knowledgeable. He’ll defeat his enemies without the use of military weapons. He’ll make the world peaceful, and the people won’t have anything to fear.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“If he’s unhappy with the world and leaves home to pursue the path, then he’ll become a Tathāgata, Arhat, and Completely Awakened One who perfects the ten epithets. This is how you’ll know if Gautama is fake or genuine.”</p>
<h3>Ambāṣṭha Behaves Badly</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>After he accepted his teacher’s instruction, Ambāṣṭha prepared horses and a treasure chariot. At daybreak, he led his five hundred student disciples to the citron grove. Arriving there, he dismounted his chariot and proceeded on foot to the Bhagavān. He stood when the Bhagavān sat and sat when the Bhagavān stood while they were discussing a topic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>The Buddha asked the student, “Have you talked with elder, senior, and great priests like this in the past?”</p>
<p>The student asked the Buddha, “Why do you ask that?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>The Buddha told the student, “When I’m sitting, you stand, and you sit when I’m standing while we have this discussion. Is this the way you and your teacher discuss a teaching?”</p>
<p>The student said to the Buddha, “We priests discuss a teaching while both are sitting, both are standing, or both are laying down. Now, ascetics are disfigured and single. They’re despicable, inferior, and practice a dark teaching. I don’t ever sit or get up when I’m discussing something with such people.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>The Bhagavān then said to him, “You, student, aren’t disciplined yet.”</p>
<p>When the student heard the Bhagavān call him “you” but before he heard “aren’t disciplined yet,” he became angry and disparaged the Buddha: “These Śākyans are so envious, evil, and lacking in courtesy!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>The Buddha asked the student, “What did the Śākyans do to you?”</p>
<p>The student said, “There was a time once when my teacher was in Kapilavastu of the Śākyas for some minor reason. There was a group of Śākyans who had gathered in a meeting hall for some minor reason, too. When they saw us coming from a distance, they slighted and teased us. They didn’t follow the rules of courtesy nor treat each other with respect.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>The Buddha told the student, “When they return to their own country, the Śākyans amuse themselves as they want like birds flying to their tree nests, coming and going freely. Śākyans amuse themselves freely in their own country in the same way.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>The student said to the Buddha, “There are four castes in the world: The warriors, the priests, the householders, and the workers. The other three castes always honor, respect, and support the priests. The customs of the Śākyans should be the same. Those Śākyans are low class, despicable, and inferior people, yet they disrespected us priests.”</p>
<h3>Ambāṣṭha Is Brought to Heel</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>The Bhagavān then silently thought to himself, “This youth has repeatedly spoken insultingly and <span class='add'>[acted like someone of]</span> low class. Perhaps I’ll tell him about his history to discipline him.” The Buddha asked the student, “What is your clan?”</p>
<p>The student replied, “My clan is Svararāja.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>The Buddha told the student, “That clan of yours is from the servant class of the Śākyas.”</p>
<p>His 500 student disciples raised an uproar, saying to the Buddha, “Don’t say such things as ‘This student is from the servant class of the Śākyas’! Why is that? This great student is a legitimate son of his clan. He’s handsome looking, eloquent, accommodating, and broadly learned. It’s enough to converse with Gautama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>The Buddha then told the 500 students, “If your teacher is not entirely as you say, I’ll set aside your teacher and discuss the matter with you. If your teacher is superior in the ways you say, then you ought to be quiet, and I’ll discuss it with your teacher.”</p>
<p>The 500 students said to the Buddha, “We’ll be quiet and listen to you discuss it with our teacher.” The 500 students all fell silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>The Bhagavān then told Ambāṣṭha, “Going back to a time in the distant past, there was a king named Ikṣvāku. This king had four sons. One was named Ulkāmukha, the second was named Hastikaśīrṣa, the third was name Karakaṇḍa, and the fourth was named Opura.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“The king’s four sons were young and committed offenses. The king banished them from the country, and they went south of the Himalaya Mountains to live in a teak tree grove. The mothers and family members of those four sons missed them, so they held a meeting and went to King Ikṣvāku. They said, ‘Great king, you should know that we’ve been separated from your four sons for a long time. We would like to go see them.’</p>
<p>“The king replied, ‘If you want to go, do as you like.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“After the mothers and their relatives heard the king’s instruction, they went to the teak tree grove south of the Himalaya Mountains where the four sons lived. Then the mothers said <span class='add'>[to each other]</span>, ‘I’ll give my daughter to your son, and you give your daughter to my son. Match them up to be married as husband and wife. They’ll have handsome-looking sons.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“King Ikṣvāku then heard that the mothers of his four sons had given their daughters to be their wives, and they had given birth to handsome sons. The king was delighted and exclaimed, ‘They are true Śākyans! True Śākyan boys!’ They were able to stand and survived on their own, so they were called Śākya as a result.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“King Ikṣvāku was the first of the Śākya lineage. The king had a servant named Diśa who was good-looking. She had a relationship with a priest and became pregnant as a result. She gave birth to a boy who fell to the ground able to speak. He would look for his parents and say, ‘You must bathe me! Remove this filth! I’ll love you when I’m older!’ Because he could speak, her first-born son was called Svararāja.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“Just as present-day people are frightened when a first-born son can speak and call him ‘Terrible,’ he was likewise. Being born able to speak, they called him Svararāja. From that time to today, his priest clan’s name has been Svararāja.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>The Buddha asked the student: “Haven’t you heard this history of your clan before when you visited senior, elder, and great priests?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>The student remained silent and didn’t reply. The Buddha asked him again, but he still didn’t reply. The Buddha asked him a third time, and then said to the student: “I’ve asked you a question three times. You ought to answer promptly, for when someone doesn’t answer me, their head is smashed into seven pieces by the guhyaka warriors who are standing at my side armed with metal hammers.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>The guhyaka warriors armed with metal hammers hovered in the air over the student’s head. If he didn’t answer the question right then, their iron hammers would’ve come down and smashed the student’s head. The Buddha told the student, “Look for yourself.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>The student looked, and he saw the guhyaka warriors hovering in the air with their metal hammers. When he saw that, he was frightened, and his hair stood on end. He got up and moved closer to the Bhagavān, hoping the Bhagavān would protect him. He said, “Ask me again, Bhagavān. I will answer you now.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>The Buddha then asked the student: “Haven’t you heard this history of your clan before when you visited senior, elder, and great priests?”</p>
<p>The student answered, “I believe that what I’ve heard before really did happen.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>His five hundred student disciples raised their voices, saying to each other, “This Ambāṣṭha really is descended from a Śākyan servant family!” “The ascetic Gautama speaks the truth!” “We’ve been acting badly, feeling so proud!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>The Bhagavān then thought, “These five hundred students will surely be arrogant after this and call him a servant. Now, I’ll do something to dismiss that servant reputation.” He then told the five hundred students, “You students, take care not to call him someone descended from a servant family. Why is that? He was once a priest who was a great and powerful sage. He attacked King Ikṣvāku to get his daughter, and the king gave her to him out of fear.” The Buddha dismissed that slave reputation with these words.</p>
<h3>The Superiority of the Warrior Caste</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a>The Bhagavān then told Ambāṣṭha, “How is it, student? Suppose a warrior woman is descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine <span class='add'>[warriors]</span>, and she isn’t slighted by other people. If she’s married to a priest and bears him a son who’s handsome, would that son enter the warrior caste, be given a seat and water, and recite the warrior’s law?”</p>
<p>He replied, “He wouldn’t.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>“Would he get his father’s property and business?”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a>“Would he inherit his father’s office?”</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a>“How is it, student? Suppose a priest woman is descended from seven generations of fathers and mothers who were genuine <span class='add'>[priests]</span>, and she isn’t slighted by other people. She’s married to a warrior and bears him a son who’s handsome. When he enters that priest’s community, would he be given a seat and be offered water when he rises?”</p>
<p>He replied, “He would.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc39'>SC 39</a>“Would he get to recite the priest’s law, get his father’s property, or inherit his father’s office?”</p>
<p>“He would.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc40'>SC 40</a>“How is it, student? If a priest rejects the priesthood and joins the warrior caste, would he be given a seat, be offered water when rising, and recite the warrior’s law?”</p>
<p>He replied, “He wouldn’t.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a>“Would he get his father’s property or inherit his father’s office?”</p>
<p>He replied, “He wouldn’t.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc42'>SC 42</a>“If a warrior rejects the warriors and joins the priests, would he be given a seat, be offered water when rising, and recite the priest’s law? … Would he get his father’s property or inherit his father’s office?”</p>
<p>He replied, “He would.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc43'>SC 43</a>“Therefore, student, the warrior woman is the best of women, and the warrior man is the best of men. It’s not the priests.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a>“The god Brahmā himself spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>‘Those born among warriors are best,<br>
Whose families and clans are genuine.<br>
Accomplished in insight and conduct,<br>
They are supreme among gods and people.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a>The Buddha told the student, “Brahmā spoke this verse, and it truly is well spoken and not unskillful. I agree with it. Why is that? Now, I am a Tathāgata, an Arhat, and a Completely Awakened One. I also spoke this meaning:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“‘Those born among warriors are best,<br>
Whose families and clans are genuine.<br>
Accomplished in insight and conduct,<br>
They are supreme among gods and people.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Leaving Home and Perfecting Precepts</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a>The student said to the Buddha, “Gautama, what is this unsurpassed man like, who is accomplished in insight and conduct?”</p>
<p>The Buddha told the student, “Listen closely, listen closely! Consider it well. I’ll explain this for you.”</p>
<p>He replied, “Very well. I’d be glad to hear it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a>The Buddha told the student, “If the Tathāgata arises in the world who is an Arhat, Completely Awakened One, Accomplished in Insight and Conduct, Well Gone, Understander of the World, Unsurpassed Man, Trainer of Men, Teacher to Gods and People, Buddha, and Bhagavān, he alone is awakened and self-realized among all the gods, and worldly people, whether ascetics and priests, or the gods, Māra, and King Brahmā. He explains the teaching for people that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end. It’s content and expression are complete and reveal the pure practice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a>“Suppose a householder, a householder’s son, or someone from the other castes hears the right teaching, and they believe it. With that belief, they think, ‘Now, I live at home bound to my wife and children. I’m not able to purely cultivate the religious life. I would rather shave my hair, put on the three Dharma robes, and leave home to cultivate the path.’ At some other time, they renounce home and property, abandon their friends and family, shave their hair, put on the three Dharma robes, and leave home to cultivate the path. They live with renunciants who equally abandon ornaments, and their practice of precepts is complete.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a>“They don’t harm sentient beings. They renounce weapons, are conscientious and modest, and have kind thoughts for all beings. This is not killing.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a>“They abandon thoughts of stealing. They don’t take what’s not given, their minds are pure, and they don’t think about personal profit. This is not stealing.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc51'>SC 51</a>“They abandon sexual desire. They purely cultivate the religious life, are careful and energetic, aren’t defiled by desire, and live purely. This is not engaging in sex.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc52'>SC 52</a>“They abandon false speech, are sincere and not deceptive, and don’t fool other people. This is not speaking falsely.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc53'>SC 53</a>“They abandon duplicity. What they hear said here they don’t convey to others there. What they hear said there they don’t convey to others here. They skillfully bring together those who are alienated, and they work for mutual friendship and respect. All their speech is harmonious and aware of the occasion. This is not being duplicitous.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc54'>SC 54</a>“They abandon harsh speech, which is words that are crude or fierce, that delight in troubling other people, and that cause the bonds of resentment to arise. They abandon such words. Their words are gentle and don’t cause harm. They’re beneficial to many people. The community has respect and affection for them, gladly listening to their words. This is not speaking harshly.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc55'>SC 55</a>They abandon frivolous speech. Their words are aware of the occasion, sincere, and accord with the teaching. They settle disputes according to the discipline. When there’s reason to speak, their speech doesn’t miss the point. This is abandoning frivolous speech.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc56'>SC 56</a>“They abandon drinking alcohol, part with carelessness, and aren’t attached to fragrances, flowers, and jewelry. They don’t watch or listen to songs and dances. They don’t sit on high seats, eat at the wrong time, or accept and use gold, silver, or the seven treasures. They don’t marry wives or concubines and don’t take care of servants, workers, elephants, horses, carts, cattle, chickens, dogs, pigs, sheep, farmland, or pleasure parks. Nor do they fool other people with fraudulent weights and measures and then carry away the profit in their hands. They don’t put others in debt to trap them. This is not being fraudulent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc57'>SC 57</a>“They abandon such evils, ceasing disputes and unskillful affairs. When they conduct themselves, they’re aware of the time and don’t act at the wrong time. They eat the amount of food their stomach holds and don’t accumulate anything more than what they need. Their robes are sufficient for their bodies. Their Dharma clothes and bowl are their constant companions like a flying bird’s wings. A monk has nothing more in the same way.</p>
<h3>Criticisms of Other Ascetics and Priests</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who accept the faithful gifts of others and then seek what another has saved. They are never satisfied with their robes and meals. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms and pursue their own occupation. They plant trees that are refuges for demons and spirits. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms and still pursue ways of seeking benefits like high and large beds <span class='add'>[made of]</span> elephant ivory and various treasures, various embroideries, carpets, blankets, and cushions. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc61'>SC 61</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who accept another’s faithful gifts and still pursue ways of adorning themselves. They rub their bodies with ghee and oil, wash with fragrant water, smear themselves with fragrant powder, and comb their hair with fragrant oil. They wear beautiful flower garlands, color their eyes dark blue, put makeup on their faces, and attach rings and thread to themselves. They look at themselves with mirrors, wear leather shoes of various colors, and wear pure white over their clothes. They keep weapons, followers, valuable parasols, valuable fans, and decorated, valuable chariots. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc62'>SC 62</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms and focus on entertaining themselves by playing games like chess on boards with eight squares, ten squares, a hundred squares … <span class='add'>[a thousand]</span> squares. They have fun in various ways. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc63'>SC 63</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms but only teach obstructions to the path. They discuss unbeneficial things such as kings, battles, events involving chariots and horses, friends, comrades, and officials. They ride horses and chariots here and there, walk in pleasure gardens, and have conversations while lying, rising, and walking about women, clothing, eating, and family matters. They also discuss the subject of diving in the ocean to hunt for treasures. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc64'>SC 64</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms but only pursue countless ways of wrong livelihood. They flatter others with pretty expressions or appear to criticize them in order to pursue benefits. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc65'>SC 65</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms but only debate with each other. They might visit parks or go to lakes and meeting halls and refute each other. They say, ‘I know the teachings and discipline; you know nothing.’ ‘I’ve arrived at the correct path; you are going down the wrong road.’ ‘You put what’s first last or put what’s last first.’ ‘I’m tolerant of you, but you don’t tolerate me.’ ‘The words that you say aren’t true or correct.’ ‘If you have any doubts, you should come and ask me, and I’ll answer it completely.’ No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc66'>SC 66</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms and still pursue their livelihoods on other ways. They serve as messengers for kings, royal officials, priests, or householders, traveling from here to there and there to here. They take messages from here and deliver them there and take messages from there and deliver them here. They might do this personally or instruct others to do it. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc67'>SC 67</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms but only practice battle tactics and martial arts. They might practice wielding melee weapons or bow and arrow. They might fight animals like chickens, dogs, pigs, sheep, elephants, horses, cattle, and camels. They might fight with men and women and make many sounds with conchs, drums, while singing and dancing. They might climb poles, perform handstands, and practice various acrobatics. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc68'>SC 68</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms and practice teachings that obstruct the path. They make their living with wrong livelihoods such as telling the signs of men and women’s good and bad fortune, their beauty and ugliness, or the signs of livestock. They do this seeking profit. No one who enters my teaching does such things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc69'>SC 69</a>“Student, take the example of other ascetics and priests who eat another’s faithful alms and practice teachings that obstruct the path.

They harmonize their body to cease old pains, ensure new pains don’t arise, have strength without issues, and make the body comfortable.

In the early evening, they’re always mindful and unified in mind whether walking or sitting, and they rid themselves of the various hindrances. When the middle of the night arrives, they lie down on their right side to sleep, remembering the time to wake up. Fixing their thoughts on the morning, their minds are undisturbed.

They happily reside in a quiet place, under a tree, or in a charnel ground. Whether they stay in a mountain cave, on open ground, or in a refuse heap, when it’s time to solicit alms, they wash their hands and feet and put their robe and bowl in a safe place when they return.

Doing so, student, they can’t perfect the <span class='add'>[unsurpassed]</span> insight and conduct. Instead, they practice this third method. How is it, student?

<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc140'>SC 140</a>The Buddha told the student, “Your own pettiness makes you unaware of what’s true or false, yet you slander and belittle the Śākyans while your own lineage is rooted in misdeeds that grow the source of Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc141'>SC 141</a>“Furthermore, student, <span class='add'>[someone]</span> can’t perfect the unsurpassed insight and conduct, but they don’t eat herbs and grass, fallen fruit, or grass and leaves. Instead, they build a large raised hall in a town or city, and people come from the east, west, south, and north to offer the donations that they can. Doing so, they can’t perfect the unsurpassed insight and conduct. Instead, they practice this fourth method. How is it, student? Do you or your teacher practice this method?”</p>
<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc142'>SC 142</a>The Buddha told the student, “Your own pettiness makes you unaware of what’s true or false, yet you slander and belittle the Śākyans while your own lineage is rooted in misdeeds and grows from the source of Hell.</p>
<h3>The Ancient Priests</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc143'>SC 143</a>“How is it, student? The priests and sages of antiquity had many arts. They praised and commended the hymns of the past. Present-day priests recite and commend them as 1. Aṣṭaka, 2. Vāmaka, 3. Vāmadeva, 4. Viśvāmitra, 5. Aṅgiras, 6. <span class='add'>[Yamataggi]</span>, 7. Vasiṣṭha, 8. Kāśyapa, 9. Aruṇa, 10. Gautama, 11. <span class='add'>[Suyiva]</span>, and 12. Sundara. Such great sages and priests dug moats and erected raised halls. Do you and your teacher’s followers today live like they did?”</p>
<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc144'>SC 144</a>“Those great sages would have built a walled city where they lived and surrounded it with houses. Do you and your teacher’s followers today live like they did?”</p>
<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc145'>SC 145</a>“Didn’t those great sages sit on high seats with layered cushions and carpets that were fine and soft? Do you and your teacher’s followers today live like they did?”</p>
<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc146'>SC 146</a>“Didn’t those great sages enjoy gold, silver, jewelry, colorful flower garlands, and beautiful women? Do you and your teacher’s followers do the same? … Didn’t those great sages have treasure chariots pulled by horses whose drivers were armed with lances, that were covered with white canopies? … Didn’t they have precious fans and wear colorful and valuable sandals as well as all-white cotton cloth? Do you and your teacher’s followers wear those things?”</p>
<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc147'>SC 147</a>“Student, your own pettiness makes you unaware of what’s true or false, yet you slander and belittle the Śākyans while your own lineage is rooted in misdeeds that grow the source of Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc148'>SC 148</a>“How is it, student? Just as those great sages and priests of antiquity praised and commended reciting the hymns, the priests today commend and recitation of Aṣṭaka and the others. They hand down their teachings and teach them to others hoping to be born in the Brahma Heaven, but it’s impossible.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc149'>SC 149</a>“Student, it’s like when King Prasenajit holds a meeting with others. He might be meeting with kings, officials, priests, or householders. A low-ranking person hears them, goes into Śrāvastī, and tells the people they meet, ‘King Prasenajit had this to say.’ How is it, student? Would the king have a meeting with such a person?”</p>
<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc150'>SC 150</a>“Student, that person recited the king’s words and told them to other people. Would he be made a high official by the king?”</p>
<p>He answered, “That would be impossible.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc151'>SC 151</a>“Student, today your tradition recites the teachings of former generations, great sages, and ancient priests. You want to be born in the Brahma Heaven, but it’s impossible. How is it, student? Do all of you accept the offerings of others while following that method of practice?”</p>
<p>He answered, “Yes, Gautama. We accept the offerings of others and practice that method.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc152'>SC 152</a>“Student, you and your teacher Puṣkarasārin accepted a fiefdom from the king, but when you have a meeting with King Prasenajit, you teach the king nonessential treatises and unbeneficial words, so there’s no way to admonish him to do the right things.</p>
<h3>Ambāṣṭha Sees the Thirty-Two Signs</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc153'>SC 153</a>“Now you see for yourself you and your teacher’s errors. Setting those things aside, there’s just the circumstances that brought you here.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc154'>SC 154</a>Thereupon, the student examined the Tathāgata’s body searching for the signs and excellencies. He saw all the signs except for the two that weren’t visible. This caused him to feel doubtful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc155'>SC 155</a>The Bhagavān then silently thought to himself, “Now, this student doesn’t see two of the signs, and that has made him doubtful.” He then stuck out his long and broad tongue sign and covered his ear with it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc156'>SC 156</a>The student was still doubtful about the other sign, and the Bhagavān again thought, “Now, this student is still doubtful about this one sign.” He then used his miraculous ability to privately show him his hidden horse-like penis.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc157'>SC 157</a>After seeing all his signs, the student no longer doubted the Tathāgata. He rose from his seat, circled the Buddha, and departed.</p>
<h3>Ambāṣṭha Returns to His Teacher</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc158'>SC 158</a>While standing outside his door looking into the distance, the priest Puṣkarasārin saw his disciple approaching from far away. He met him and asked, “Did you examine Gautama to see if his signs were real? Are his virtues and miraculous abilities really as we’ve heard?”</p>
<p>The student then said to his teacher, “The ascetic Gautama is replete with all 32 signs. His virtues and miraculous abilities are really as we’ve heard.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc159'>SC 159</a>His teacher again asked, “Did you talk a little with Gautama?”</p>
<p>He answered, “I did in fact exchange words with Gautama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc160'>SC 160</a>The teacher again asked, “What did you discuss with Gautama?”</p>
<p>The student told his teacher about the words he exchanged with the Buddha.</p>
<p>His teacher said, “I had an intelligent disciple to send as my messenger, but we’ll soon end up in Hell. Why is that? You spoke as a superior and criticized Gautama. When my messenger is displeasing, it comes back to me. You and the other intelligent disciples were sent with this errand, but I’ll soon end up in Hell <span class='add'>[on your account]</span>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc161'>SC 161</a>Under the influence of the bond of resentment, the teacher kicked his student, making him fall from the chariot they were riding. After he fell from the chariot, the student developed vitiligo.</p>
<h3>Puṣkarasārin Visits the Buddha</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc162'>SC 162</a>Examining the position of the sun, the priest Puṣkarasārin thought, “I’d pay a visit to the ascetic Gautama, but it’s not the right time now. I’ll need to wait until tomorrow, then I’ll go and visit him.” When the sun rose the next day, he prepared his treasure chariot and horses and proceeded to the citron grove surrounded by five hundred disciples. He then dismounted and continued on foot until he reached the Bhagavān. After they exchanged greetings, he sat to one side. Looking closely at the Tathāgata’s body, he saw that he had the signs, but he didn’t see two of them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc163'>SC 163</a>The priest was doubtful about those two signs. Knowing his thoughts, the Buddha then stuck out his long and broad tongue and covered his ear with it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc164'>SC 164</a>The priest was still doubtful about the other sign. Knowing his thoughts, the Buddha used his miraculous abilities to allow him to see his hidden horse-like penis.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc165'>SC 165</a>When the priest saw the Tathāgata’s 32 signs, his mind was opened, and he had no more misgivings. Quickly, he said to the Buddha, “If I meet the Buddha on the road while traveling, I’ll stop my chariot for a brief rest. You should consider it as though I’m bowing respectfully to the Bhagavān. Why is that? I’ve received another’s fiefdom. If I were to dismount from my chariot, I would lose this fiefdom and a bad reputation would be circulated about me.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc166'>SC 166</a>He also said to the Buddha, “If I dismount, untie my sword, close my parasol, and remove my banner, water bottle, and sandals, you should consider it as though I’m venerating the Tathāgata. Why is that? I’ve received another’s fiefdom. If I were to dismount from my chariot, I would lose this fiefdom and a bad reputation would be circulated about me.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc167'>SC 167</a>He also said to the Buddha, “Suppose I’m with my assembly and see the Buddha rise. If I bare my right shoulder and declare my clan’s name, you should consider it as though I’m venerating the Tathāgata. Why is that? I’ve received another’s fiefdom. If I were to dismount from my chariot, I would lose this fiefdom and a bad reputation would be circulated about me.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc168'>SC 168</a>He also said to the Buddha, “I take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha. Permit me to be a layman of the correct teaching! Hereafter, I won’t kill, steal, commit adultery, lie, or drink alcohol. Please let the Bhagavān and those in this large assembly accept my invitation.”</p>
<h3>The Buddha Visits Puṣkarasārin</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc169'>SC 169</a>The priest saw that the Buddha remained silent and knew that he had given his consent. He then rose from his seat and departed, bowing to the Buddha and circling him three times without thinking about it. He went back and prepared meals of fine delicacies. When they were ready, he returned and said, “It’s time.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc170'>SC 170</a>The Bhagavān then put on his robe and took his bowl to the priest’s house with that large assembly of 1,250 monks. Arriving, they prepared their seats and sat down.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc171'>SC 171</a>The priest then personally served the meals, giving a variety of sweet delicacies to the Buddha and the Saṅgha. When they finished eating and washing their bowls, the priest took his disciple Ambāṣṭha to the Buddha with his right hand and said, “Please let the Tathāgata permit us to repent for our wrongdoing! Please let the Tathāgata permit us to repent for our wrongdoing!” He repeated this three times.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc172'>SC 172</a>He also said to the Buddha, “Like a well-trained elephant or horse that returns again to the correct path when it goes astray, this man is thus. Although he was contaminated, it’s gone now. Please permit him to repent for his wrongdoing!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc173'>SC 173</a>The Buddha told the priest, “It will lengthen your life to do so, and you’ll find peace in the present life. It will also rid your disciple of his vitiligo.” After the Buddha agreed, that disciple’s vitiligo was cured.</p>
<h3>Puṣkarasārin Attains Stream-Entry</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc174'>SC 174</a>The priest then fetched a small chair for the Buddha to sit in front of the assembly, and the Bhagavān explained the teaching for them. With plain instruction that’s gainful and joyous, he discussed generosity, precepts, birth in the heavens, the defilement of desire, the trouble of the contaminants, the transcendence of escape, and the declaration of purity. When he knew that the priest’s mind was gentle, pure, undefiled, and capable of accepting instruction about the path, the Bhagavān taught him the eternal teaching of Buddhas. He explained the noble truth of suffering, the noble truth of suffering’s formation, the noble truth of suffering’s cessation, and the noble truth of suffering’s escape.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc175'>SC 175</a>Sitting right there on his seat, the priest had his dust and defilements removed and his Dharma eye was purified. It was like a pure and clean white cloth that’s easily stained. The priest Puṣkarasārin was likewise. He saw the teaching, attained the teaching, became certain about the fruits of the path, didn’t believe other paths, and attained fearlessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc176'>SC 176</a>He then said to the Buddha, “Now, I take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha of monks three times. Permit me to become a layman of the correct teaching! For the rest of my life, I won’t kill, steal, commit adultery, lie, or drink alcohol. Please let the Bhagavān and the great assembly have pity on me and accept my invitation for the next seven days.” The Bhagavān then silently consented to this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc177'>SC 177</a>During the next seven days, the priest gave a variety of offerings to the Buddha and his large assembly. After that, the Bhagavān traveled among the people.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc178'>SC 178</a>Not long after the Buddha departed, the priest Puṣkarasārin fell sick, and his life ended. When the monks heard that this priest had given offerings to the Buddha for seven days before his life ended, they each thought, “Where was he born after his life ended?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc179'>SC 179</a>A group of monks went to the Buddha. After bowing to him, they sat to one side of the Buddha and said, “That priest had given offerings to the Buddha for seven days before his body broke up and his life ended. Where was he reborn?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc180'>SC 180</a>The Buddha told the monks, “This clansman had broadly collected virtues, perfected one teaching and the next, and didn’t go contrary to the teaching. He ended the five lower bonds and will reach parinirvāṇa without returning to this world.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc181'>SC 181</a>When the monks heard what the Buddha had taught, they rejoiced and approved.</p>
