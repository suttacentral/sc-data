<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>:  One time, the Buddha was staying at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove of Śrāvastī. He was accompanied by a large group of 1,250 monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “I will give all of you a discourse on the sublime teaching, the content and expression of which is pure and perfects the religious life. It’s the teaching in three categories. All of you, listen closely and consider it. I will teach this for you.”</p>
<p>The monks then accepted the teaching and listened.</p>

I’m the Tathāgata; I’ve provided all that I should for you. Taking pity on you, I’ve lectured on the sutras and the path. You should also take pity on yourselves and go to a quiet place under a tree or in an empty dwelling to contemplate. Don’t be negligent. Nothing’s gained by not exerting yourselves today and regretting it later.”</p>
