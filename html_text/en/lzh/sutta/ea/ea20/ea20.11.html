<h1><span class='add'>The Love of Parents</span></h1>

<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying in Śrāvastī, at Jetṛ’s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s <a class='t' id='t601a'></a> Park. Then the Exalted One said to the monks:</p>
<p>“<span class='add'>I</span> tell you that the kindness of two persons can never be repaid. Of which two? Of one’s father and mother.</p>
<p>“Even if someone should carry about his father on his left <span class='add'>shoulder</span> and his mother on his right <span class='add'>shoulder</span> and if he should do so for countless years; if he should <span class='add'>take care of them by providing them with</span> clothing, food shelter and medicine to cure illness and emaciation, and should they even <span class='add'>while being carried on his shoulders</span> pass stool and urine <span class='add'>that he would have to put up with</span>, he would still be unable to repay <span class='add'>their kindness</span>.</p>
<p>“You should know, monks, that because of one’s father’s and mother’s acts of kindness one is deeply indebted to them: one has been embraced and reared by them, all the time and ever ready to protect <span class='add'>their children</span>, and never losing time in perfecting <span class='add'>their children’s</span> becoming aware of the wider world. It is on account of this ‘skill in means’ that one appreciates how difficult it is to repay <span class='add'>one’s parent’s</span> kindness.</p>
<p>“Therefore, O monks, one should treat one’s father and mother with great respect and never be remiss in one’s filial duty. Thus, O monks, you should train.”</p>
<p>After listening to the Buddha’s words, the monks were pleased and respectfully applied themselves to practice.</p>
