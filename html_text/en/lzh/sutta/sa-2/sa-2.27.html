<h1>Māra throws a boulder</h1>

<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain. The sky was covered with clouds. It rained lightly and lightning flashed brightly everywhere. At that time the World-honored One was walking in the open at night. There King Māra the Bad had this thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying in Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain; the sky is covered with clouds, it is raining lightly, and lightning is flashing brightly everywhere. While he is walking in the open at night, I should go and disturb him.” Having thought thus, King Māra went up that mountain and pushed a large boulder down to hit the Buddha. The boulder <span class='add'>however</span> shattered by itself. At that time the World-honored One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>“You <span class='add'>might</span> destroy Gijjhakūṭa Mountain /<br>
turn it to dust;<br>
<span class='add'>you might</span> break apart /<br>
the vast continents and the immense ocean.<br>
<span class='add'>However,</span> to inspire fear /<br>
in someone who has attained true liberation,<br>
to make his hair stand on end /<br>
will never be possible.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama knows my thoughts.” He became depressed and dispirited, made his body invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
