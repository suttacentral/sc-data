<h1>Sakka and Verocana</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>At that time Sakka Devānaṃ Inda and the <i>asura</i> Verocana came to the Buddha at night. Splendid and radiant, they paid homage at the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side. The brilliance of Sakka and Verocana filled the Jeta Grove with light just as if it were daytime. Then Verocana sat to one side and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“People who strive continuously /<br>
will certainly attain what they seek.<br>
Having attained the benefits they sought /<br>
they have peace and happiness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka also spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“People who strive continuously /<br>
will certainly attain what they seek.<br>
Having attained the benefits they sought, /<br>
practicing patience is supreme.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>Then Sakka asked the Buddha: “World-honored One, was what we said beneficial or not beneficial?”</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>The Buddha told Sakka: “What is well explained is always well spoken. Now hear what I have to say.” And he spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a>“For the sake of gain, sentient beings /<br>
all strive for whatever they desire.<br>
The desire for gains, the wish for happiness: /<br>
if people strive with strong effort they will attain what they seek<br>
Once the goal is attained, patience is supreme; /<br>
therefore one should practice patience.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>Having heard what the Buddha had said Sakka and Verocana paid homage at his feet, vanished from that place and returned to their heavenly palaces.</p>
