<h1>Saṅgāmaji and his former wife</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>At that time the elder Saṅgāmaji had travelled to Sāvatthī from Kosala and gone to the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. At that time Saṅgāmaji’s former wife learned that he had come to Sāvatthī. She got dressed, put on her jewelery, took their son with her and went to Saṅgāmaji’s place. When Saṅgāmaji came out to walk about in the open, she approached him and said: “Our son is too small to sustain himself, therefore I have come to see the venerable one.” Although he saw her, he did not speak with her. She addressed him a second and a third time, but though the Venerable Saṅgāmaji stood facing her, he did not look at her nor speak. His former wife then said to him: “I came to see you, but you will not speak with me. Here is your son, raise him yourself!” Placing the son in his father’s path, she left him there and went back. Some distance away she stopped and looked back. The venerable still did not speak to his son. There the former wife thought to herself: “This renunciant has well attained liberation, he has been able to cut off the fetter of attachment. The cutting off, which the seer <span class='add'>the Buddha, has accomplished</span>, he too has attained completely.” Her wish unfulfilled, she went back, took the child, and carried him back home.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>At that time the World-honored One, with his pure divine hearing surpassing human hearing, heard what Saṅgāmaji’s former wife had said and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>“To see them coming and not rejoice /<br>
to see them leaving and not be sad,<br>
one who has cut off all attachment and desire /<br>
is the very best <i>brāhmaṇa</i>.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>When they come, one does not rejoice /<br>
When they leave, one is not sad,<br>
getting rid of defilements, practicing in purity /<br>
this is called a wise <i>brāhmaṇa</i>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
