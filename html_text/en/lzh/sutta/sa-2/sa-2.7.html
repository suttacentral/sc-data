<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>At that time there was a monk named Tissa, who was a son of the Buddha’s paternal aunt. Relying on his kinship with the Buddha, he often harbored arrogance, did not respect the elder and virtuous monks, and behaved without conscience and shame. He often talked a lot, but when the other monks said little in return, he became angry. Some monks having observed this a few times, went to the Buddha, holding their hands with palms together <span class='add'>in salutation</span> paid homage at his feet and sat to one side. They told the Buddha: “World-honored One! Tissa often harbors arrogance, says of himself: ‘I am the son of the Buddha’s paternal aunt.’ He thinks little of the elder monks. He often talks a lot and when the other monks say little in return, he becomes angry.” The Buddha told the monks: “Go now and call monk Tissa.” As ordered by the Buddha they went and summoned Tissa. When he received the summons, he went to the Buddha, and having paid homage at his feet, sat to one side. The <i>Tathāgata</i> then said to Tissa: “Is it true that when meeting the elder monks, your mind is without respect, without conscience and shame? Is it true that you are talking a lot and when the other monks say little in return, you become angry?” Tissa answered: “It is true, World-honored One!” The Buddha told Tissa: “Especially since you are the son of my paternal aunt, you should generate deep respect towards the venerable and virtuous elders and all monks, and your demeanor should be conscientious and with a sense of shame. You should speak less, listen to what others say, and be tolerant.”</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Always practice the good, never generate anger /<br>
whatever generates anger cannot be called good.<br>
Tissa, now that you are here with me /<br>
cut off your anger and arrogance;<br>
practice all that is good and live a pure and chaste life /<br>
I am happy for those who do so.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
