<p><a class='sc' id='sc1'></a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc2'></a>At that time there was a nun called Vīrā staying in the Rājakārāma Vihāra near Sāvatthī. In the morning she took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat <span class='add'>for meditation</span> and went to the Andhavana forest <span class='add'>to meditate</span>. At that time King Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama is staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park. And there is the nun Vīrā who took her robes and her begging bowl and entered the town to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat and has gone into the Andhavana forest. I shall disturb her!” Having thought this, he changed into a young man, and, standing by the wayside, addressed her with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc3'></a>“Who creates this shape, /<br>
who is its creator?<br>
From where did this shape appear, /<br>
whither will it go?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc4'></a>At that time Vīrā thought: “Who is this, who wants to disturb me? What a deceiver! Is he a human or a non-human being?” She entered concentration and using her insight, recognized that it was King Māra. She answered him with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc5'></a>“Shapes are neither self-created /<br>
nor created by others.<br>
When various conditions meet, they come into being; /<br>
parted from these conditions they dissolve and vanish,</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc6'></a>Just as planted seeds /<br>
grow in dependence on earth,<br>
so the aggregates ( <i>khandha</i>s), elements (<i>dhātu</i>s) and spheres (<i>āyatana</i>s) /<br>
together form shapes.<br>
Dependent on suffering <span class='add'>they</span> grow; /<br>
dependent on suffering they dissolve and vanish.</p>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc7'></a><span class='add'>I have</span> cut off all craving, /<br>
the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having attained complete cessation, /<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> peacefully dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br>
Bad One, you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='sc' id='sc8'></a>At that time King Māra thought: “This nun knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
