<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone1' data-uid='pdhp1'>Cone 1</a>Mind precedes thoughts,<br>
mind is their chief, they are impelled by mind,<br>
if with a base mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that, suffering follows him<br>
like a wheel follows the ox’s foot.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone2' data-uid='pdhp2'>Cone 2</a>Mind precedes thoughts,<br>
mind is their chief, they are impelled by mind,<br>
if with pure mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that, happiness follows him<br>
like a shadow which does not depart.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone3' data-uid='pdhp3'>Cone 3</a>Here he laments, after death he laments,<br>
the wicked one laments in both places,<br>
he laments, he suffers vexation,<br>
seeing the defilement of his own deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone4' data-uid='pdhp4'>Cone 4</a>“He abused me, he struck at me,<br>
he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who bear these ill-will<br>
their hatred is never appeased.</p>

he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who do not bear these ill-will<br>

<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone7' data-uid='pdhp7'>Cone 7</a>Living contemplating what is pleasant,<br>
uncontrolled in sense faculties,<br>
not knowing the limit in food,<br>
indolent, low in energy—<br>
Māra surely overthrows that one,<br>
like wind overthrows a weak tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone8' data-uid='pdhp8'>Cone 8</a>Living contemplating the unpleasant,<br>
well-controlled in sense faculties,<br>
and knowing the limit in food,<br>
faithful, with energy aroused—<br>
Māra does not overthrow that one,<br>
just as wind does not overthrow a mountain made of rock.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone9' data-uid='pdhp9'>Cone 9</a>If you should find a prudent, wise companion,<br>
one who lives well, a wise one,<br>
overcoming all your troubles<br>
you should live with that one, glad and mindful.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone10' data-uid='pdhp10'>Cone 10</a>If you do not find a prudent, wise companion,<br>
one who lives well, a wise one,<br>
like a king who abandons his conquered kingdom,<br>
one should live alone like a solitary elephant in the forest.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone11' data-uid='pdhp11'>Cone 11</a>It is better to live alone,<br>
there can be no companionship with a fool,<br>
one should live alone and not do anything bad,<br>
unconcerned like a solitary elephant in the forest.</p>

transgresses Dhamma,<br>
his fame diminishes,<br>
like the moon in the dark fortnight.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone13' data-uid='pdhp13'>Cone 13</a>He who, through desire, hatred, fear or delusion,<br>
does not transgress Dhamma,<br>
his fame increases,<br>
like the moon in the bright fortnight.</p>
