<h1>13. The Chapter about Refuge</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='216-217' data-uid='pdhp216-217'></a>Many people shaken by fear go for refuge to mountains and woods,<br>
to places with beautiful trees.<br>
That is not a secure refuge,<br>
that is not the refuge supreme,<br>
nor is it the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='218-219' data-uid='pdhp218-219'></a>Whoever has gone for refuge to the Buddha,<br>
the Dhamma and the Saṅgha,<br>
and who sees as it really is the four noble truths.<br>
That is a secure refuge,<br>
that is the refuge supreme,<br>
that is the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='220-221' data-uid='pdhp220-221'></a>If, when cows are crossing a road,<br>
their leader goes crookedly,<br>
they all will go crookedly,<br>
as their guide crookedly does go.<br>
So it is with humans,<br>
he who is agreed upon as chief,<br>
if he lives unrighteously,<br>
so will other people.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='222-223' data-uid='pdhp222-223'></a>If, when cows are crossing a road,<br>
their leader goes straight,<br>
they all will go straight,<br>
as their guide straight does go;<br>
so it is with humans,<br>
he who is agreed upon as chief,<br>
if he lives righteously,<br>
so will other people.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='224' data-uid='pdhp224'></a>One should live by Dhamma, with good conduct,<br>
not with bad conduct,<br>
living by Dhamma one lives at ease in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='225' data-uid='pdhp225'></a>One should live by Dhamma, with good conduct,<br>
not with bad conduct,<br>
living the holy life one lives at ease in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='226' data-uid='pdhp226'></a>The one who finds pleasure in the Dhamma,<br>
delights in Dhamma, reflects on Dhamma,<br>
the monastic who remembers Dhamma,<br>
does not abandon the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='227' data-uid='pdhp227'></a>The Dhamma protects the one who lives by the Dhamma,<br>
the Dhamma well-practised is set on happiness,<br>
this is the advantage of the Dhamma well-practised,<br>
he who lives by the Dhamma does not go to a bad destination.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='228' data-uid='pdhp228'></a>The Dhamma protects the one who lives by the holy life,<br>
the Dhamma well-practised is set on happiness,<br>
this is the advantage of the Dhamma well-practised,<br>
he who lives the holy life does not go to a bad destination.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='229' data-uid='pdhp229'></a>Not having lived the holy life,<br>
not having gained wealth in their youth,<br>
they waste away like herons in a small lake devoid of fish.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='230' data-uid='pdhp230'></a>Not having lived the holy life,<br>
not having gained wealth in their youth,<br>
they lie like shafts scattered from a bow,<br>
wailing about things in the past.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='231' data-uid='pdhp231'></a>The mindful ones who are striving do not delight in a dwelling,<br>
like geese who abandon a lake,<br>
they abandon fondness for homes.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='232' data-uid='pdhp232'></a>As geese go through the path of the sky,<br>
they go through the sky by their power,<br>
the wise are led out in the world,<br>
after crushing Māra and his army.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='233' data-uid='pdhp233'></a>Why this laughter, why this joy,<br>
when the world is constantly burning,<br>
when thrown into darkness,<br>
do you not seek for a light?</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='234' data-uid='pdhp234'></a>As a town in the border districts<br>
is guarded on the inside and the outside,<br>
so one should protect oneself,<br>
and you should not let the moment pass,<br>
for when the chance has passed they grieve<br>
when consigned to the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='235' data-uid='pdhp235'></a>Not through being shaven is one an ascetic,<br>
if one lacks vows, speaks lies,<br>
and is endowed with greed and desire,<br>
how will one be an ascetic?</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='236' data-uid='pdhp236'></a>The one who quenches wicked deeds,<br>
small and great, in every way—<br>
through the appeasing of wicked deeds he is said to be an ascetic.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='237' data-uid='pdhp237'></a>For the one in whom thirty-six streams<br>
consisting of contact with conceit are strong,<br>
the one with wrong view is carried off<br>
by the flow of his greedy intentions.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='238' data-uid='pdhp238'></a>One should abandon anger, one should abandon conceit,<br>
one should overcome every fetter,<br>
without clinging to mind and bodily form,<br>
sufferings never do befall the one having no possessions.</p>
