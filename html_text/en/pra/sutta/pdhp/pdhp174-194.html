<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone174' data-uid='pdhp174'>Cone 174</a>Stupid fools live having themselves as their own foes,<br>
committing wicked deeds,<br>
which produce bitter fruit.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone175' data-uid='pdhp175'>Cone 175</a>How could he do that deed,<br>
which, having done, one has regret,<br>
for which he has tears on his face,<br>
as the result follows him round.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone176' data-uid='pdhp176'>Cone 176</a>But that deed is well done,<br>
which, having done, one has no regret,<br>
for which he is pleased and happy,<br>
as the result follows him round.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone177' data-uid='pdhp177'>Cone 177</a>As far as learning arises for a fool,<br>
it is only to his disadvantage,<br>
it destroys the fool’s good quality,<br>
and it will destroy his head.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone178-179' data-uid='pdhp178-179'>Cone 178-179</a>He wishes for the respect that is lacking,<br>
and status amongst the monastics,<br>
for control in the living quarters,<br>
and worship amongst good families:<br>
“Householders and renunciants<br>
should think this was done by me,<br>
let none be a match for me,<br>
in all to be done and not done”,<br>
so does the fool think,<br>
meanwhile his desires and conceit increase.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone180-181' data-uid='pdhp180-181'>Cone 180-181</a>For the means to gains is one thing,<br>
the path going to Nibbāna another,<br>
thus seeing this as it really is<br>
the disciple of the Buddha<br>
should not delight in honours,<br>
but practise in solitude.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone182' data-uid='pdhp182'>Cone 182</a>The fool thinks there is success,<br>
when he speaks words that are rough,<br>
but for the one who knows,<br>
endurance is the success of the good.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone183' data-uid='pdhp183'>Cone 183</a>Without power is the power of him<br>
whose power is the power of a fool,<br>
reproach is not found for the powerful one,<br>
protected by Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone184' data-uid='pdhp184'>Cone 184</a>The fool who conceives he is a fool,<br>
is at least wise in that matter,<br>
the fool who is proud of his wisdom,<br>
he is said to be a fool indeed.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone185' data-uid='pdhp185'>Cone 185</a>Long is the night for one who sleeps not,<br>
long is a league for one tired,<br>
long is the round of births and deaths for fools<br>
who know not True Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone186' data-uid='pdhp186'>Cone 186</a>That man who wraps up rotting fish with the best fragrant grass,<br>
makes the fragrant grass smell rotten,<br>
and so with those who associate with fools.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone187' data-uid='pdhp187'>Cone 187</a>That man who wraps up pinwheel<br>
in flame-tree leaves,<br>
makes even the leaf fragrant,<br>
and so with those who associate with the wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone188' data-uid='pdhp188'>Cone 188</a>If one who does no wickedness associates with those who do,<br>
he is suspected of wickedness,<br>
and his disrepute increases.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone189' data-uid='pdhp189'>Cone 189</a>An associate associating<br>
with others who are touched by contacts,<br>
like a smeared arrow in a bunch,<br>
smears that which is unsmeared,<br>
fearing being smeared the wise one<br>
will not have wicked friends.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone190' data-uid='pdhp190'>Cone 190</a>Therefore knowing the result for oneself of the fruit container,<br>
he should not follow the bad one,<br>
the wise one should associate with the good one.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone191' data-uid='pdhp191'>Cone 191</a>Even if a fool attends on a wise man for his whole life long,<br>
he does not learn Dhamma,<br>
like the spoon learns not the taste of curry.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone192' data-uid='pdhp192'>Cone 192</a>If a perceptive man attends on a wise man even for a second,<br>
he quickly learns Dhamma,<br>
like the tongue learns the taste of curry.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone193' data-uid='pdhp193'>Cone 193</a>One should not despise a little wickedness thinking:<br>
it will not come to me,<br>
through the falling of water drops<br>
the water-pot is quickly filled,<br>
the fool, gathering bit by bit,<br>
becomes full of wickedness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone194' data-uid='pdhp194'>Cone 194</a>One should not despise little merit thinking:<br>
it will not come to me,<br>
through the falling of water drops<br>
the water-pot is quickly filled,<br>
the wise one, gathering bit by bit,<br>
becomes full of merit.</p>
