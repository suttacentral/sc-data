<h1>10. The Chapter about Stains</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='157' data-uid='pdhp157'></a>Lack of repetition is the ruin of the Vedā,<br>
a lack of maintenance is the ruin of homes,<br>
indolence is the ruin of one’s appearance,<br>
heedlessness is the ruin of those on guard.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='158' data-uid='pdhp158'></a>Bad conduct is a woman’s stain,<br>
stinginess is a giver’s stain,<br>
wicked deeds are a stain<br>
both in this world and in the next.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='159' data-uid='pdhp159'></a>I say there is a stain worse than that,<br>
ignorance is a deadly stain,<br>
after abandoning those stains,<br>
live without stains, monastics!</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='160' data-uid='pdhp160'></a>As a rust stain arises from iron,<br>
and arisen from that, it eats it away,<br>
so with one who is overindulgent—<br>
his deeds lead him to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='161' data-uid='pdhp161'></a>You are now a withered leaf,<br>
Yama’s men stand waiting for you,<br>
you stand at decay’s door,<br>
with no provisions for the journey found.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='162' data-uid='pdhp162'></a>You should strive and endeavour by yourself,<br>
like a smith, you should remove the stain,<br>
removing the stain, blemishless,<br>
you seek the second noble realm.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='163' data-uid='pdhp163'></a>The sage gradually,<br>
little by little, moment by moment,<br>
should remove the stain from himself,<br>
like a smith removes the stain from silver.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='164' data-uid='pdhp164'></a>Life is light for one without shame,<br>
he lives a life with defilements,<br>
backbiting and recklessness,<br>
with the bold courage of a crow.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='165' data-uid='pdhp165'></a>Life is hard when endowed with shame,<br>
for the one constantly seeking purity,<br>
for one sincere, and not reckless,<br>
looking for purity of life.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='166' data-uid='pdhp166'></a>Easy to see are others’ fault,<br>
but one’s own is hard to see,<br>
for one sifts other peoples’ faults like they were chaff,<br>
but conceals one’s own faults,<br>
like a crafty player conceals his defeat.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='167' data-uid='pdhp167'></a>Easily done are things not good,<br>
and unbeneficial for oneself,<br>
but that which is beneficial and good<br>
is supremely hard to do.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='168' data-uid='pdhp168'></a>Easily done are things not good,<br>
and unbeneficial for oneself,<br>
but only those beneficial and good<br>
are done by the wise.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='169' data-uid='pdhp169'></a>They are ashamed of what is not shameful,<br>
not ashamed of what is shameful,<br>
seeing fear in what is not fearful,<br>
not seeing fear in what is fearful,<br>
undertaking wrong views,<br>
beings go to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='170' data-uid='pdhp170'></a>Finding blame in what is blameless,<br>
not perceiving blame in what is blameable,<br>
undertaking wrong views,<br>
beings go to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='171' data-uid='pdhp171'></a>Finding the essential in the unessential,<br>
and perceiving the unessential in the essential,<br>
they do not understand what is the essential,<br>
and resort to wrong intention.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='172' data-uid='pdhp172'></a>Knowing the essential in what is essential,<br>
and the unessential in what is unessential,<br>
they understand what is essential,<br>
and resort to right intention.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='173' data-uid='pdhp173'></a>Engaging oneself in what is not suitable,<br>
not engaging in what is suitable,<br>
abandoning the good, grasping the loved,<br>
they envy those who endeavour for good.</p>
