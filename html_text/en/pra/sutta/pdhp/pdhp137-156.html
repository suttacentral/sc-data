<h1>9. The Chapter about Craving</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='137' data-uid='pdhp137'></a>For a human who lives life heedlessly<br>
craving increases like a clinging creeper,<br>
he rushes from one place to another<br>
like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='138' data-uid='pdhp138'></a>That one who is overcome by these low cravings in the world,<br>
which are difficult to get past,<br>
for him griefs increase<br>
like grass that has been rained upon.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='139' data-uid='pdhp139'></a>Whoever overcomes this low craving in the world,<br>
which is difficult to get past,<br>
griefs roll from him<br>
like a drop of water on a lotus.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='140' data-uid='pdhp140'></a>This I say to you: “Good luck to as many as have assembled here”,<br>
dig up the root of craving,<br>
like one seeking the root digs up grass,<br>
for one who has cut off the root of craving<br>
there are no griefs, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='141' data-uid='pdhp141'></a>A man with craving as companion<br>
has a long time in births-and-deaths,<br>
in this existence or another existence,<br>
here and there, again and again.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='142' data-uid='pdhp142'></a>Having understood the danger,<br>
that craving is the origination of suffering,<br>
free from craving, without attachment,<br>
the monastic should wander mindfully.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='143-144' data-uid='pdhp143-144'></a>That bondage is not so strong say the wise,<br>
that is made of iron or wood or reeds,<br>
impassioned and excited they seek out<br>
jewels and earrings and children and wives—<br>
that bondage is strong say the wise,<br>
dragging down, subtle, hard to get free from,<br>
having cut this down the good go peacefully<br>
seeking nothing, abandoning all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='145-146' data-uid='pdhp145-146'></a>Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found for sense desires,<br>
the wise one knowing:<br>
“Sense pleasures have little joy, much suffering,”<br>
does not find delight even in heavenly pleasures.<br>
The disciple of the Perfect Sambuddha delights in craving’s destruction.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='147' data-uid='pdhp147'></a>Without craving, without attachment,<br>
skilled in words and their explanation,<br>
knowing how syllables are arranged,<br>
which come before and which after,<br>
the one in his final body<br>
is said to be one of great wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='148' data-uid='pdhp148'></a>There are flowing streams<br>
of affection and mental happinesses for a person,<br>
pleasure-dependent they seek happiness,<br>
those people undergo birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='149' data-uid='pdhp149'></a>People surrounded by craving<br>
crawl round like a hare in a trap,<br>
they are attached and clinging to fetters,<br>
they come back again and again to the womb for a long time.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='150' data-uid='pdhp150'></a>Be free of the past, be free of the future,<br>
be free of the present, after crossing over all existence,<br>
with mind liberated in every way,<br>
you will not return to birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='151' data-uid='pdhp151'></a>The one who is free from desires, who is free in the forest,<br>
though free from the forest, runs back to the forest,<br>
come here and look at that person,<br>
though free, he runs back to bondage.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='152' data-uid='pdhp152'></a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds,<br>
these people are ruined by passion,<br>
therefore there is great fruit<br>
for that given to those without passion.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='153' data-uid='pdhp153'></a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds,<br>
these people are ruined by hatred,<br>
therefore there is great fruit<br>
for that given to those without hatred.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='154' data-uid='pdhp154'></a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds,<br>
these people are ruined by delusion,<br>
therefore there is great fruit<br>
for that given to those without delusion.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='155' data-uid='pdhp155'></a>The delightful wilderness wherein the people do not delight,<br>
those without passion delight therein,<br>
but not those who seek sense pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='156' data-uid='pdhp156'></a>Just as when the root remains firm and undamaged<br>
though the tree was cut down, it springs up again,<br>
so when the tendency to craving is not rooted out<br>
this suffering appears again and again.</p>
