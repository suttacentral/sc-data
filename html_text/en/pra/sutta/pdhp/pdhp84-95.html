<h1>6. The Chapter about Grief</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='84' data-uid='pdhp84'></a>Whatever griefs or lamentations there are,<br>
and the many kinds of suffering in the world,<br>
these all arise because of love,<br>
without loves, these do not originate.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='85' data-uid='pdhp85'></a>Therefore they are happy and free from grief,<br>
who are without love for anything in the world,<br>
therefore those wanting what is griefless, dust-free,<br>
should not have love for anything in the world.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='86' data-uid='pdhp86'></a>For the one who has reached his goal, who grieves not,<br>
being released on all sides,<br>
who has abandoned all the knots,<br>
no consuming fever is found.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='87' data-uid='pdhp87'></a>For those who have no stores,<br>
those who comprehend food aright,<br>
like the birds in the sky,<br>
their footprint is hard to find.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='88' data-uid='pdhp88'></a>His mind is calm,<br>
his speech and his actions are also calm,<br>
liberated by right knowledge,<br>
such a one is truly peaceful.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='89' data-uid='pdhp89'></a>For the one whose senses are balanced,<br>
like horses well-trained by their charioteer,<br>
who has abandoned conceit, who is without pollutants—<br>
even the gods envy such a one.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='90' data-uid='pdhp90'></a>They lead one trained into a crowd,<br>
a king mounts one who has been trained,<br>
amongst humans one trained is best,<br>
the one who can endure reproof.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='91' data-uid='pdhp91'></a>Noble are the well-trained horses,<br>
the well-bred horses from Sindh,<br>
and the great tusker elephants,<br>
and even more noble than that<br>
is the one who has trained himself.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='92' data-uid='pdhp92'></a>Not by these vehicles can one reach that place,<br>
as one through training himself well,<br>
being trained by the training, goes.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='93' data-uid='pdhp93'></a>Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind,<br>
so the wise are not shaken by blame or praise.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='94' data-uid='pdhp94'></a>The one who, while still impure,<br>
would wear the renunciant’s robe,<br>
unendowed with restraint and truth,<br>
is not worthy of the renunciant’s robe.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='95' data-uid='pdhp95'></a>The one who, steady in virtue,<br>
throws out any impurity,<br>
endowed with restraint and truth,<br>
is indeed worthy of the renunciant’s robe.</p>
