<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='278' data-uid='pdhp278'></a>Verbally guarded, well-restrained in mind,<br>
he who does not practice a wrong deed with the body,<br>
purifying these three paths of action,<br>
would attain the unsurpassed state of peace.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='279' data-uid='pdhp279'></a>One should guard against bodily faults,<br>
one should be restrained bodily,<br>
abandoning wrong bodily conduct,<br>
one should have good bodily conduct.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='280' data-uid='pdhp280'></a>One should guard against verbal faults,<br>
one should be restrained verbally,<br>
abandoning wrong verbal conduct,<br>
one should have good verbal conduct.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='281' data-uid='pdhp281'></a>One should guard against mental faults,<br>
one should be restrained mentally,<br>
abandoning wrong mental conduct,<br>
one should have good mental conduct.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='282' data-uid='pdhp282'></a>The wise are restrained bodily,<br>
verbally and also mentally,<br>
the wise are restrained in every way,<br>
they are indeed very well-restrained.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='283' data-uid='pdhp283'></a>This is something of old, Ādhora,<br>
this is not something of today:<br>
they blame the one who sits silently,<br>
they blame the one who talks in moderation,<br>
they blame the one who talks a lot,<br>
there is no one in the world not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='284' data-uid='pdhp284'></a>There was not and there will not be,<br>
and at present there is not found<br>
a person totally blameworthy,<br>
or one totally praiseworthy.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='285' data-uid='pdhp285'></a>He who would worship or reproach the one who is unrighteous,<br>
a fool with lack of intelligence, that is to no purpose.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='286-287' data-uid='pdhp286-287'></a>The one who, after being examined<br>
day by day, is praised by the wise,<br>
faultless in conduct, sagacious,<br>
attending to virtue and wisdom,<br>
one who is like a golden coin,<br>
who is there worthy to blame him?<br>
That one is praised by the gods,<br>
and has been praised by the Brahmās too.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='288' data-uid='pdhp288'></a>Not by eloquence only,<br>
or by a beautiful complexion,<br>
is a person honourable,<br>
if still jealous, selfish and deceitful.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='289' data-uid='pdhp289'></a>In whom is truth, Dhamma, abstinence,<br>
restraint and good training,<br>
that sage who has thrown out hatred is said to be honourable.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='290' data-uid='pdhp290'></a>Even though reciting abundant scriptures,<br>
the heedless fellow, who does not do what they say,<br>
like a cowboy counting other’s cattle,<br>
does not partake of the ascetic life.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='291' data-uid='pdhp291'></a>Even though reciting but few scriptures,<br>
but living righteously in accordance with Dhamma,<br>
abandoning greed, hate and delusion,<br>
with mind released, completely without doubt,<br>
that one, unattached here and hereafter,<br>
surely partakes of the ascetic life.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='292' data-uid='pdhp292'></a>One should speak out the truth, one should not get angry,<br>
when requested you should give, if only a little,<br>
through these three conditions<br>
one can go to the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='293' data-uid='pdhp293'></a>The miserly go not to the world of the gods,<br>
fools surely do not praise giving,<br>
but the wise one rejoices in giving,<br>
and through that he goes to the world of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='294' data-uid='pdhp294'></a>Having virtue, being pure and clever,<br>
principled, knowing the truths,<br>
the good one doing the deeds that are his own,<br>
that one the people love.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='295' data-uid='pdhp295'></a>It’s better to have eaten glowing iron balls, like flames of fire,<br>
than that the monastic who is unrestrained and unvirtuous<br>
should enjoy the country’s almsfood.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='296' data-uid='pdhp296'></a>As <i>kusa</i> grass, wrongly grasped, cuts into the hand,<br>
so does the ascetic life, wrongly grasped,<br>
drag one down to the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='297' data-uid='pdhp297'></a>For the person speaking falsely,<br>
who has transgressed in this one thing,<br>
who has abandoned the next world,<br>
there is no wickedness left undone.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='298' data-uid='pdhp298'></a>For not a well-sharpened sword,<br>
or even deadly poison,<br>
destroy quite as quickly as words that are badly spoken.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='299' data-uid='pdhp299'></a>For with the birth of a man an axe is born in his mouth,<br>
with which he cuts himself speaking a word that is badly spoken.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='300' data-uid='pdhp300'></a>He who praises the blameworthy,<br>
or he who blames the praiseworthy,<br>
piles up bad fortune with his mouth,<br>
and because of that bad fortune he does not find happiness.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='301' data-uid='pdhp301'></a>(Compared to) he who has a small measure of bad fortune through dice and loses his wealth,<br>
everything (he owns), together with his self;<br>
this is indeed a far greater bad fortune: he who has a corrupt mind aimed at those faring well.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='302' data-uid='pdhp302'></a>For one hundred and thirty-six thousand<br>
<i>nirabbudas</i>, and five <i>abbudas</i>,<br>
he goes to hell through reproaching the noble ones,<br>
having wicked verbal and mental intentions.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='303' data-uid='pdhp303'></a>He should speak wholesomely,<br>
he should not speak wickedly,<br>
the speaking of what is wholesome is best,<br>
having spoken wickedly he suffers.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='304' data-uid='pdhp304'></a>He should practice wholesomely,<br>
he should not speak wickedly,<br>
the speaking of what is wholesome is best,<br>
having spoken wickedly he suffers.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='305' data-uid='pdhp305'></a>He should speak wholesome words,<br>
he should not speak wickedly,<br>
arisen anger he should constrain,<br>
he ceases from hatred.</p>
