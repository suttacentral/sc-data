<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='mc' id='261-62' data-uid='pdhp261-262'></a>Amongst humans few people go beyond,<br>
the rest of the people run down the bank,<br>
but those who live righteously,<br>
conforming with this well-taught Dhamma,<br>
those folk will go beyond the realm of death,<br>
which is very hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='263-264' data-uid='pdhp263-264'></a>Having abandoned the dark state,<br>
the wise ones should develop the bright,<br>
having gone forth to homelessness from home;<br>
in solitude, where it is hard to delight,<br>
one should seek to delight in that place,<br>
having given up sense pleasures, and having no possessions,<br>
he should purify the self of defilements of mind in every way.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='265' data-uid='pdhp265'></a>For he who has well developed<br>
with peaceful mind the factors of complete awakening,<br>
having given up the self,<br>
those who delight in being unattached,<br>
pollutant-free, shining forth,<br>
are emancipated in the world.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='266' data-uid='pdhp266'></a>That to be done is rejected,<br>
but what is not to be done is done,<br>
for the insolent, the heedless,<br>
their pollutants increase.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='267' data-uid='pdhp267'></a>But for those who always properly undertake<br>
mindfulness of the body<br>
who do not practice what is not to be done,<br>
persisting in what is to be done,<br>
for those mindful ones, those fully aware,<br>
their pollutants are destroyed.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='268' data-uid='pdhp268'></a>Those who look for others’ fault,<br>
who constantly perceive offence,<br>
for them the pollutants increase,<br>
they are far from their destruction.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='269' data-uid='pdhp269'></a>For those devoted to being alert,<br>
who train both by day and by night,<br>
who are intent on Nibbāna,<br>
the pollutants are laid to rest.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='270' data-uid='pdhp270'></a>For those whose pollutants are destroyed,<br>
who are not dependent on the foods,<br>
for those whose resort is the liberation<br>
that is empty or signless,<br>
like the birds in the sky,<br>
their footprint is hard to find.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='271-272' data-uid='pdhp271-272'></a>Not even through virtue or vows,<br>
or again through great learning,<br>
or through the attainment of concentration,<br>
or through a secluded dwelling,<br>
do we attain the happiness of renunciation,<br>
not practised by worldly people;<br>
let a monastic not be confident<br>
as long as the destruction of the pollutants is unattained.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='273' data-uid='pdhp273'></a>This is not the time to be heedless,<br>
while the destruction of the pollutants is unattained,<br>
heedless he follows suffering,<br>
like the mother of deer follows the lion.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='274' data-uid='pdhp274'></a>Some fall back into the womb,<br>
but those who are wicked in the underworld,<br>
the righteous go to heaven,<br>
those who are pollutant-free are emancipated.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='275' data-uid='pdhp275'></a>Like a lake that is deep, clear and unruffled,<br>
just so the wise are confident after listening to Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='276' data-uid='pdhp276'></a>He whose victory cannot be undone,<br>
whose victory does not come to an end,<br>
the Buddha, the one of superior effort,<br>
by what path will you lead the pathless one?</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='277' data-uid='pdhp277'></a>For him there is no desire, attachment,<br>
or craving to lead him anywhere,<br>
the Buddha, whose range is endless,<br>
by what path will you lead the pathless one?</p>
