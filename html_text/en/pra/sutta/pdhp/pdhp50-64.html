<p><a class='mc' id='50' data-uid='pdhp50'></a>Restraint is good everywhere,<br>
restraint is everywhere good,<br>
a monastic who is restrained everywhere<br>
is liberated from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='51' data-uid='pdhp51'></a>Restraint of body is good,<br>
restraint of speech is good,<br>
restraint of mind is also good,<br>
restraint is everywhere good,<br>
a monastic who is restrained everywhere<br>
is liberated from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='52' data-uid='pdhp52'></a>One who controls his hands, controls his feet,<br>
controls his speech, controls the mind faculty,<br>
with inner delight and composure,<br>
solitary, content: that one is called a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='53' data-uid='pdhp53'></a>Calm in body and calm in mind,<br>
having calmness and composure,<br>
having thrown off worldly gain<br>
the monastic is called one at peace.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='54' data-uid='pdhp54'></a>That monastic who restrains the mouth,<br>
who speaks well, and who is modest,<br>
who teaches the meaning of the Dhamma,<br>
his speech is sweet.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='55' data-uid='pdhp55'></a>One should not despise one’s own gains,<br>
one should not live envious of others,<br>
the monastic who is envious of others<br>
does not attain concentration.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='56' data-uid='pdhp56'></a>Even if a monastic gains little<br>
he should not despise his gains,<br>
even the very gods praise<br>
the one of pure life who is diligent.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='57' data-uid='pdhp57'></a>Please bail out this boat, monastic,<br>
when bailed out it will go lightly,<br>
cutting off passion and hatred,<br>
from here one will go to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='58' data-uid='pdhp58'></a>With uplifted mind, happy,<br>
having overcome what is dear and not dear,<br>
then with lots of happiness,<br>
the monastic should wander mindfully.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='59' data-uid='pdhp59'></a>That monastic who dwells in loving-kindness,<br>
with faith in Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
has penetrated the state of peace,<br>
the joy in stilling of all conditions,<br>
here and now there is Nibbāna,<br>
the unsurpassed release from all bonds.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='60' data-uid='pdhp60'></a>For the one who has entered an empty place,<br>
a monastic with a peaceful mind,<br>
there is superhuman delight<br>
from insight into true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='61' data-uid='pdhp61'></a>Just as one with right mindfulness<br>
regarding the rise and fall of the components of mind and body<br>
gains happiness in mind,<br>
this is the deathless state for the one who knows.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='62' data-uid='pdhp62'></a>There is no concentration for one without wisdom,<br>
there is no wisdom for one without concentration,<br>
that one in whom there is concentration and wisdom<br>
is indeed close to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='63' data-uid='pdhp63'></a>This is the very beginning<br>
for the wise monastic here:<br>
contentment, guarding the senses,<br>
and restraint in the regulations.</p>
<p><a class='mc' id='64' data-uid='pdhp64'></a>One should resort to spiritual friends,<br>
ones of pure life, ones who are diligent,<br>
one should be one of friendly disposition,<br>
one who will be skilful in conduct,<br>
rejoicing frequently because of that,<br>
the monastic should wander mindfully.</p>
