<h1><span class='add'>5. Agreeable Things</span></h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>From those things that are agreeable comes sorrow; from those things that are agreeable comes fear: if one casts off agreeable things he will be without sorrow, without fear.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>From that which is enjoyable comes fear; from the agreeable comes misery, from the agreeable fear: if that which is pretty changes, one reaps but despair.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>The miseries of the world are numerous—sorrow, lamentations, cries, etc.; they all arise from holding on to those things that are agreeable: if one gives up what is agreeable they will all cease to be.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>They for whom there is nothing whatever agreeable in the world are happy and without sorrow; they therefore who would be without affliction, free from human passions, must never do that which is agreeable.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>Not to see what is agreeable is painful, so likewise is the sight of what is not agreeable; one must never seek what is agreeable; he must not seek what is not agreeable.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>It is by being deprived of what is agreeable and by finding what is disagreeable that men create <span class='add'>(for themselves)</span> the intolerable sorrow of age.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>When that in which one delights does die, such as one's kinsfolk or friends, it brings one a great and enduring sorrow, for to be separated from that which brings pleasure is painful.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>He who knows neither agreeable or disagreeable is without bonds; he, therefore, who considers the agreeable as sinful will give up what is agreeable.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>He who, having ceased to consider what is agreeable, has nought to do with attachment to <span class='add'>(worldly)</span> happiness, who has attachment to the happiness that is not that of the individual, seeks the object of his fond desires <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>He who among gods and men is held by fondness for what is pleasing in the body <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rūpa)</i>, does evil and suffers affliction, he falls into the power of age and death.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>He who is steadfast both by day and night, who casts away what is pleasing in the body <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rūpa)</i>, which is difficult to do, pulls up by the very roots sin, that food of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh12'></a>The foolish people, who consider what is not good as good, what is not agreeable as agreeable, what is misery as happiness, will surely come to destruction.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh13'></a>He who, doing evil, would be made happy by it, finds no contentment, let him not do evil.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh14'></a>He who, doing what is right, would be made happy by it, finds contentment, let him not do evil.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh15'></a>As the frontier town is protected by strong retrenchments, so let him who would be happy protect himself by strong defences.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh16'></a>The wise man who would be made happy watches during all the three watches; his watchfulness makes him safe.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh17'></a>When the frontier town is well guarded within and without, its peace is not disturbed: do likewise and watch thyself; for when one has been born in hell his peace is gone and he repents him <span class='add'>(of what he has left undone)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh18'></a>Look where you will, there is nothing dearer to man than himself; therefore, as it is the same thing that is dear to you and to others, hurt not others with what pains yourself.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh20'></a>To all men this life is dear; all men fear punishment; you, who are like unto them, strike not, put not to death.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh21'></a>He who has been to a great distance and who returns from afar without mishap, his assembled kinsfolk and friends receive him with joyful cries of “Alala!”</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh22'></a>So likewise he who has been virtuous, on arriving from this world into another, his good works receive him like kinsfolk and welcome him.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh23'></a>Lay up, therefore, good works in view of the other world; for it is good works that receive beings in the other world.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh24'></a>He whose life is one of virtue is praised by the gods; he in whom there is nothing to be blamed finds perfect joy in heaven.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh25'></a>He who observes the law, who is perfectly virtuous, modest, speaking the truth, doing what he ought to do, delights the rest of mankind.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh26'></a>He who, doing what he ought to do, and who, extolling the true law, gives to others pleasure, shall find joy in the other world.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh27'></a>His speech is edifying, and he has given up all wrong doings, in this delights the righteous, and delights not the unrighteous.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh28'></a>Therefore what is good and what is not good are separated at death; the unrighteous go to hell, the righteous go to heaven.</p>
