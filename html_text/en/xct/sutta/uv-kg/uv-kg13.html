<h1><span class='add'>13. Honours (Satkāra)</span></h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>As the she-mule <span class='add'>(dies)</span> on account of her offspring, as the reed and the plantain decay on bearing fruit, so likewise is the foolish man destroyed by honours.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>No matter how long the fool sacrifices, he will not cease from being infatuated; the fool's bright lot goes on decreasing until it brings to sorrow even the crown of his head.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>The fool wishes for riches, for the subjection of the Bhixus <span class='add'>(to his orders)</span>, for lordship in the abode <span class='add'>(of the clergy)</span>, to receive the homages of other people.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>“Let both priests and laymen, whosoever they may be, imagine that it is I <span class='add'>(who have done it)</span>; in whatever is to be done or not done, let them be subject to me;” such is the mind of the fool, and his desires greatly increase.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>One is the way to wealth, another is the road to nirvāṇa; if the Bhixu, the disciple of the Buddha, has learnt this, he finds no pleasure in honours, but seeks after perfect seclusion <span class='add'>(from the world)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>Retain no fondness for anything; deceive no man; give up any occupation; in <span class='add'>(following)</span> the law one must not be engaged in commerce.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>Look after what is to your own profit and envy not what is to that of another, for the Bhixu who does envy another cannot find tranquillity <i lang='san' translate='no'>(samādhi)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>If a Śramana aspires to lead a happy life, let him put on the gown <i lang='san' translate='no'>(sanghāti)</i> of the priesthood and receive alms of food and drink.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>If a Śramana aspires to lead a happy life, let him keep to a dwelling-place <span class='add'>(of the priesthood)</span>, as the reptile does to the rat's hole.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>If a Śramana aspires to lead a happy life, let him be contented with the meanest things, and think only of the greatest of laws.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>Though one does not know much, if one keeps well the moral precepts, leading <span class='add'>(such)</span> a life according to his knowledge, men say of him in praise, “he is not heedless.”</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh12'></a>If one possesses the three spotless sciences that overcome the lord of death, the fool thinks he knows nothing, and that he can blame him.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh13'></a>He who is under the rule of misery and sin, if he has but food, drink, and wealth, him the fool will praise.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh14'></a>He whose head is shaven, and who wears the saffron-coloured gown, but who seeks only for food, drink, clothes, and bedding, is his greatest enemy.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh15'></a>When, therefore, one knows the sinfulness and danger of honours, with but few desires, and having cast away all agitation of the mind, the reflective Bhixu wanders here and there.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh16'></a>The mind cannot become dispassionate with but a scrap of food, for one must eat to retain this life; he, consequently, who knows that this body only exists through eating, goes to collect alms.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh17'></a>This is what the wise reverence and honour: the removal of every atom of the grief of misery, which is a difficult task, and men honour him who is patient and painstaking; learn, therefore, how to recognise the swamp <span class='add'>(and to keep away from it)</span>.</p>
