<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh1'></a>They who, with all their energy given to reflection, find no pleasure in a home, like a swan who leaves a polluted lake, they leave their homes and cross the stream.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh2'></a>The steadfast depart from the world, having overcome the troops of Māra; they are like unto swans in the path of the sun, moving in the ether by means of their miraculous power <i lang='san' translate='no'>(irddhi)</i>).</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh3'></a>They who do not live like Brahmatchāris, and who do not acquire wealth in their youth, become like old herons on the banks of a polluted pool with few fish.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh4'></a>They who do not live like Brahmatchāris, and who do not acquire wealth in their youth, remembering what they have formerly done, they lie thirsting for the past.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh5'></a>Think not “Evil is of little importance; it will not follow after me;” for as a large vase is filled by the falling of drops of water, so will the fool become full of evil, even if he gathers it little by little.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh6'></a>Think not “Virtue is of little importance; it will not follow after me;” for as a large pot is filled by the falling of drops of water, so will the earnest man become full of virtue, even if he gathers it little by little.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh7'></a>Longing to leave the vast and turbid lake and to cross the waters of the ocean, the wise man is carried across in the vessel that he has prepared.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh8'></a>When he has crossed over, he shall inhabit the promised land of the Enlightened, of the Blessed, of the Brāhmana; therefore let the Bhixus, and they who listen <span class='add'>(to my doctrine)</span>, washing themselves clean <span class='add'>(of sin)</span>, make ready a vessel.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh9'></a>The wise and excellent man who listens to the law becomes like a deep, limpid, and pure lake.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh10'></a>When there is water everywhere, who is there who would run about seeking the water of a well? What use is there for well water? Destroy then desires from the very roots.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh11'></a>The scourer washes with water, the fletcher straightens <span class='add'>(his arrows)</span> with fire, the carpenter hews his logs, the wise man shapes himself.</p>
<p><a class='wrh' id='wrh12'></a>Passionless as the firmament, firm as the lintel of the door, the wise man delights not in transmigration, which is like a troubled lake.</p>
