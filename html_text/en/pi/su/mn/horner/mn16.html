<h1>16. Discourse on Mental Barrenness</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd1"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.101"></a><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. There the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered One,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd2"></a>“Monks, by whatever monk five mental barrennesses are not got rid of, five mental bondages are not rooted out, that he should come to growth, expansion, maturity in this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline, such a situation does not occur. Which are the five mental barrennesses that are not got rid of by him?</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd3"></a><span class="add">(1)</span> Herein, monks, the monk has doubts about the Teacher, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure. Monks, whatever monk has doubts about the Teacher, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the first mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd4"></a><span class="add">(2)</span> And again, monks, the monk has doubts about <i>Dhamma</i>, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the second mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd5"></a><span class="add">(3)</span> And again, monks, the monk has doubts about the Order, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the third mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd6"></a><span class="add">(4)</span> And again, monks, the monk has doubts about the training, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fourth mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd7"></a><span class="add">(5)</span> And again, monks, a monk comes to be angry, displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers, the mind worsened, barren. Monks, whatever monk comes to be angry, displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers, his mind worsened, barren, his mind does not incline to <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en133"></a>ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fifth mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p>These are the five mental barrennesses that are not got rid of.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd8"></a>And what are the five mental bondages that are not rooted out in him?</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd9"></a><span class="add">(1)</span> In this case, monks, a monk is not without attachment to sense-pleasures, not without desire, not without affection, not without thirst, not without fever, not without craving. Monks, whatever monk is not without attachment to sense-pleasures, not without desire, not without affection, not without thirst, not without fever, not without craving, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the first mental bondage that thus comes not to be rooted out by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd10"></a><span class="add">(2)</span> And again, monks, a monk is not without attachment to body, not without desire, not without affection, not without thirst, not without fever, not without craving, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the second mental bondage that thus comes not to be rooted out by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd11"></a><span class="add">(3)</span> <a class="pts" id="pts1.102"></a>And again, monks, a monk is not without attachment to material shapes, not without desire, not without affection, not without thirst, not without fever, not without craving, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the third mental bondage that thus comes not to be rooted out by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd12"></a><span class="add">(4)</span> And again, monks, a monk having eaten as much as his belly will hold, lives intent on the ease of bed, on the ease of lying down, on the ease of slumber. Whatever monk, having eaten as much as his belly will hold, lives intent on the ease of bed, on the ease of lying down, on the ease of slumber, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fourth mental bondage that comes to be not rooted out by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd13"></a><span class="add">(5)</span> And again, monks, a monk fares the Brahma-faring aspiring after some class of <i>devas,</i> thinking: ‘By this moral habit or custom or austerity or Brahma-faring I will become a <i>deva</i> or one among the <i>devas.</i> Whatever monk fares the Brahma-faring aspiring after some class of <i>devas,</i> thinking; ‘By this moral habit or custom or austerity or Brahma-faring I will become a <i>deva</i> or one among the <i>devas’,</i> his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fifth mental bondage that comes not to be rooted out by him whose mind does not incline <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en134"></a>to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p>These are his five mental bondages that are not rooted out.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd14"></a>Monks, by whatever monk these five mental barrennesses are not got rid of, these five mental bondages are not rooted out, that he should come to growth, expansion, maturity in this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline, such a situation does not occur. Monks, by whatever monk five mental barrennesses are got rid of, five mental bondages are properly rooted out, that he should come to growth, expansion, maturity in this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline, this situation occurs.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd15"></a>Which are the five mental barrennesses that are got rid of by him?</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd16"></a><span class="add">(1)</span> Herein, monks, a monk has no doubts about the Teacher, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure. Monks, whatever monk has no doubts about the Teacher, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the first mental barrenness that comes to be got rid of by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd17"></a><span class="add">(2)</span> And again, monks, a monk has no doubts about <i>Dhamma</i>, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure. Monks, whatever monk has no doubts about the <i>Dhamma</i>, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the second mental barrenness that comes to be got rid of by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd18"></a><span class="add">(3)</span> And again, monks, a monk has no doubts about the Order, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure. Monks, whatever monk has no doubts about the Order, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the third mental barrenness that comes to be got rid of by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd19"></a><span class="add">(4)</span> And again, monks, a monk has no doubts about the training, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure. Monks, whatever monk has no doubts about the training, is not perplexed, is convinced, is sure, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fourth mental barrenness that comes to be got rid of by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd20"></a><span class="add">(5)</span> And again, monks, a monk does not come to be angry, displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers, the mind worsened, barren. Monks, whatever monk does not come to be angry, displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers, his mind worsened, barren, his mind<a class="pts" id="pts1.103"></a> inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fifth mental barrenness that thus comes to be got rid of by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p>These are the five mental barrennesses that are got rid of by him.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd21"></a>And what are the five mental bondages that are properly rooted out by him?</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd22"></a><span class="add">(1)</span> In this case, monks, a monk comes to be without attachment to sense-pleasures, without desire, without affection, without thirst, without fever, without craving. Whatever monk is without attachment to sense-pleasures, without desire, without affection, without thirst, without fever, without craving, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the first mental bondage that comes to be properly rooted out by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd23"></a><span class="add">(2)</span> And again, monks, a monk comes to be without attachment to body, without desire, without affection, without thirst, without fever, without craving. Whatever monk is without attachment to body, without desire, without affection, without thirst, without fever, without craving, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the second mental bondage that comes to be properly rooted out by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd24"></a><span class="add">(3)</span> And again, monks, a monk comes to be without attachment to material shapes, without desire, without affection, without thirst, without fever, without craving. Whatever monk is without attachment to material shapes, without desire, without affection, without thirst, without fever, without craving, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the third mental bondage that comes to be properly rooted out by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd25"></a><span class="add">(4)</span> And again, monks, a monk not having eaten as much as his belly will hold, does not live intent on the ease <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en135"></a>of bed, on the ease of lying down, on the ease of slumber. Whatever monk, not having eaten as much as his belly will hold, does not live intent on the ease of bed, on the ease of lying down, on the ease of slumber, his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fourth mental bondage that comes to be properly rooted out by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd26"></a><span class="add">(5)</span> And again, monks, a monk does not fare the Brahma-faring aspiring after some class of <i>devas</i> and thinking: ‘By this moral habit or custom or austerity or Brahma-faring I will become a <i>deva</i> or one among the devas.’ Whatever monk does not fare the Brahma-faring aspiring after some class of devas and thinking: ‘By this moral habit or custom or austerity or Brahma-faring I will become a <i>deva</i> or one among the devas’ his mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fifth mental bondage that comes to be properly rooted out by him whose mind inclines to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p>These are the five forms of mental bondage that are properly rooted out in him.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd27"></a>Monks, by whatever monk these five forms of mental barrenness are got rid of, these five forms of mental bondage are properly rooted out, that he should come to growth, expansion, maturity in this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline, such a situation occurs.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd28"></a>He cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of intention with activities of striving; he cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of energy with activities of striving; he cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of consciousness with activities of striving; he cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of investigation with activities of striving, with exertion as the fifth. Monks, if a monk is thus possessed of fifteen factors including exertion<a class="pts" id="pts1.104"></a> he becomes one for successful breaking through, he becomes one for awakening, he becomes one for winning the incomparable security from the bonds.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd29"></a>Monks, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en136"></a>it is as if there were eight or ten or a dozen hen's eggs properly sat on, properly incubated, properly hatched by that hen; such a wish as this would not arise in that hen: ‘O may my chicks, having pierced through the egg-shells with the point of the claw on their feet or with their beaks, break forth safely.’ for these chicks were ones who were able to break forth safely having pierced through the egg-shells with the point of the claw on their feet or with their beaks. Even so, monks, is it that a monk who is thus possessed of the fifteen factors including exertion becomes one for successful breaking through, he becomes one for awakening, he becomes one for winning the incomparable security from the bonds.”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd30"></a>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
