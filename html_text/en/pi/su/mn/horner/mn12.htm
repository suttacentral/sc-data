</div>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd1"></a><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Vesālī outside the town in a woodland thicket to the west. Now at that time Sunakkhatta, the son of a Licchavi, having recently left this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline, spoke these words to a group (of people) at Vesālī: “There are no states of further-men, (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i> on (a system) of his own devising beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation; and says that <i>Dhamma</i>, taught for the sake of something specific, leads onwards the doer of it to the complete destruction of anguish.”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd2"></a>Then the venerable Sāriputta, having dressed early in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for almsfood. Then the venerable Sāriputta heard that speech of Sunakkhatta, the son of a Licchavi, as it was being spoken to the group (of people) in Vesālī: “There are no states of further-men, (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i> on (a system) of his own devising beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation; and says that <i>Dhamma</i>, taught for the sake of something specific, leads onwards <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en92"></a>the doer of it to the complete destruction of anguish.”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd3"></a>Then the venerable Sāriputta, having walked in Vesālī for almsfood, after the meal returning from (his quest for) alms, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Sāriputta spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, Sunakkhatta, the son of a Licchavi, spoke these words to a group (of people) at Vesālī: ‘There are no states of further-men, (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i> on (a system) of his own devising beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation; and says that <i>Dhamma</i>, taught for the sake of something specific, leads onwards the doer of it to the complete destruction of anguish.’”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd4"></a>“Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta is a man of wrath and folly, and these words were spoken by him in wrath. Thinking, ‘I will speak dispraise.’ he, Sāriputta, the foolish man Sunakkhatta, really spoke praise of the Tathāgata. <a class="pts" id="pts1.69"></a>For this, Sāriputta, is praise of a Tathāgata: when someone should speak thus: ‘Dhamma, taught for the sake of something specific, leads onwards the doer of it to the complete destruction of anguish.’ But, Sāriputta, there will not be for Sunakkhatta, the foolish man, this inference from <i>Dhamma</i> about me: ‘This is the Lord, perfected one, fully Self-awakened One, endowed with knowledge and right conduct, well-farer, knower of the world(s), incomparable trainer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and men, the Awakened one, the Lord.’</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd5"></a>Nor, Sāriputta, will there be for Sunakkhatta, the foolish man, this inference from <i>Dhamma</i> about me: ‘This is the Lord who enjoys the manifold forms of psychic power: From having been one he becomes manifold; from having been manifold he becomes one; manifest or invisible, he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as if through air; he plunges into the ground and shoots up again as if in water; he walks upon the water without parting it as if on the ground; sitting cross-legged he travels through the air like a bird on the wing. Even this moon and sun, although of such mighty power and majesty, he rubs and strokes them with his hand. Even as far as the Brahma-world he has power in respect of his body.’</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd6"></a>Nor, Sāriputta, will there be for Sunakkhatta, the foolish man, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en93"></a>this inference from <i>Dhamma</i> about me: ‘This is the Lord who, through the purified <i>deva</i>-condition of hearing, surpassing that of men, hears both (kinds of) sounds: deva-like ones and human ones, and those which are distant and those which are near.’</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd7"></a>Nor, Sāriputta, will there be for Sunakkhatta, the foolish man, this inference from <i>Dhamma</i> about me: ‘This is the Lord who knows intuitively by mind the minds of other beings, of other individuals; He knows intuitively of a mind that is full of attachment that it is full of attachment; he knows intuitively of a mind that is without attachment that it is without attachment; he knows intuitively of a mind that is full of aversion that it is full of aversion; he knows intuitively of a mind that is full of confusion that it is full of confusion; he knows intuitively of a mind that is without aversion that it is without aversion; he knows intuitively of a mind that is contracted that it is contracted; he knows intuitively of a mind that is distracted that it is distracted; he knows intuitively of a mind that has become great that it has become great; he knows intuitively of a mind that has not become great that it has not become great; he knows intuitively of a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it that it is a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it; he knows intuitively of a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it that it is a mind with no (other mental state) superior to it; he knows intuitively of a mind that is composed that it is composed; he knows intuitively of a mind that is not composed that it is not composed; he knows intuitively of a mind that is freed that it is freed; he knows intuitively of a mind that is not freed that it is not freed.’</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd8"></a>Now, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata has these ten powers of a Tathāgata, endowed with which powers a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.What are the ten?
</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd9"></a>(1) Herein, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is causal occasion as such and what is not causal occasion as such. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is causal occasion as such and what is not causal occasion as such, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, <a class="pts" id="pts1.70"></a> having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.
</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd10"></a>(2) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en94"></a> acquiring of deeds for oneself, past, future and present, both in their causal occasion and their result. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the acquiring of deeds for oneself, past, future and present, both in their causal occasion and their result, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd11"></a>(3) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the course leading to all bourns. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the course leading to all bourns, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd12"></a>(4) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the world with its various and diverse features. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the world with its various and diverse features this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd13"></a>(5) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as they really are the divers characters of beings. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata also comprehends as they really are the divers characters of beings, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd14"></a>(6) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the higher or lower state of the faculties of other beings, of other persons. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as it really is the higher or lower state of the faculties of other beings, of other persons, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd15"></a>(7) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata comprehends as they really are the defilement of, the purification of, the emergence from attainments in meditation, the deliverances and concentration. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata comprehends as they really are the defilement of, the purification of, the emergence from attainments in meditation, the deliverances and concentration, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd16"></a>(8) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata remembers his manifold former habitations, that is to say: One birth, and two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand births, and a hundred thousand births, and many an eon of integration, and many an eon of disintegration, and many an eon of integration-disintegration, thinking: ‘Such and such was I by name, having such a clan, such a colour, so was I nourished, I experienced this and that pleasure and pain, so did the span of life end. As that one I, passing from this, rose up again elsewhere. There, too, such a one was I by name, having such a clan, such a colour, so was I nourished, experienced this or that pleasure and pain, so did the span of life end. I, deceasing thence, rose up here.’ Thus with all their modes and detail, does<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en95"></a> he remember his manifold former habitations. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata remembers his manifold former habitations, that is to say: One birth, and two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand births, and a hundred thousand births, and many an eon of integration, and many an eon of disintegration, and many an eon of integration-disintegration, thinking: ‘Such and such was I by name, having such a clan, such a colour, so was I nourished, I experienced this and that pleasure and pain, so did the span of life end. As that one I, passing from this, rose up again elsewhere. There, too, such a one was I by name, having such a clan, such a colour, so was I nourished, experienced this or that pleasure and pain, so did the span of life end. I, deceasing thence, rose up here.’ and thus with all their modes and detail, he remember his manifold former habitations, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd17"></a>(9) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata, with his purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising, he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going according to the consequences of their deeds, and thinks: ‘Indeed, these worthy beings who were possessed of wrong conduct in body, in speech, in thought, scoffers at the ariyans, of wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body <a class="pts" id="pts1.71"></a>after dying, arise in the sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But, on the other hand, these worthy beings, endowed with good conduct in body, speech, and thought, not scoffers at the ariyans, of right view, incurring deeds consequent on right view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying arise in a good bourn, the heaven world.’ In this way, with his purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, he sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising; he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going according to their deeds. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata, with his purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising, he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going according to the consequences of their deeds, and thinks: ‘Indeed, these worthy beings who were possessed of wrong conduct in body, in speech, in thought, scoffers at the ariyans, of wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, arise in the sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But, on the other hand, these worthy beings, endowed with good conduct in body, speech, and thought, not scoffers at the ariyans, of right view, incurring deeds consequent on right view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying arise in a good bourn, the heaven world.’ In this way, with his purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, he sees beings as they are deceasing and uprising; he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going according to their deeds, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd18"></a>(10) And again, Sāriputta, a Tathāgata, by the destruction of the cankers, enters on and abides in freedom of mind, freedom through wisdom that are cankerless, having realised them here and now through his own super-knowledge. Inasmuch, Sāriputta, as a Tathāgata, by the destruction of the cankers, enters on and abides in freedom of mind, freedom through wisdom that are cankerless, having realised them here and now through his own super-knowledge, this, Sāriputta, is a Tathāgata power of a Tathāgata, having which power a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd19"></a>These, Sāriputta, are the Tathāgata ten powers of a Tathāgata, endowed with which powers the Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel. Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus, seeing me thus, should speak thus: ‘There are no states of further-men, (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i> on (a system of) his own devising beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation’ if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta, if he does not retract <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en96"></a>that thought, if he does not give up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd20"></a>Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit, endowed with concentration, endowed with intuitive wisdom, might attain profound knowledge here-now, so I say that this, Sāriputta, results thus: Not retracting that speech, not retracting that thought, not giving up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd21"></a>Sāriputta, there are these four convictions of a Tathāgata endowed with which convictions a Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel. What are the four?</p>
<p><span class="add">(1)</span> If anyone says: ‘These matters are not fully awakened to although you claim to be fully self-awakened’, as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta, on which a recluse or a brahman or a deva or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world <a class="pts" id="pts1.72"></a> can legitimately reprove me. Because I, Sāriputta, do not behold this ground, I fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><span class="add">(2)</span> If anyone says: ‘These cankers are not utterly destroyed, although you claim to be one whose cankers are destroyed.’, as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta, on which a recluse or a brahman or a deva or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world can legitimately reprove me.</p>
<p><span class="add">(3)</span> If anyone says: ‘In following those things called stumbling-blocks there is no stumbling-block at all.’, as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta, on which a recluse or a brahman or a deva or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world can legitimately reprove me.</p>
<p><span class="add">(4)</span> If anyone says: ‘Dhamma, taught by you for the sake of something specific, does not lead onward the doer of it to the complete destruction of anguish.’, as to this, I do not behold the ground, Sāriputta, on which a recluse or a brahman or a deva or Mara or Brahma or anyone in the world can legitimately reprove me.</p>
<p>These, Sāriputta, are the four convictions of a Tathāgata, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en97"></a>endowed with which convictions the Tathāgata claims the leader's place, roars his lion's roar in assemblies, and sets rolling the Brahma-wheel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd22"></a>Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus, seeing me thus, should speak thus: ‘There are no states of further-men, (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i> on (a system of) his own devising beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation’ if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta, if he does not retract that thought, if he does not give up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd23"></a>Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit, endowed with concentration, endowed with intuitive wisdom, might attain profound knowledge here-now, so I say that this, Sāriputta, results thus: Not retracting that speech, not retracting that thought, not giving up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd24"></a>These, Sāriputta, are the eight (kinds of) assemblies. What are the eight? Assemblies of nobles, assemblies of brahmans, assemblies of householders, assemblies of recluses, assemblies of the retinue of the Four Great Regents, assemblies of the Thirty-Three, Māra assemblies, assemblies of Brahmas. These eight, Sāriputta, are the assemblies. A Tathāgata who is endowed with those four convictions, Sāriputta, approaches these eight assemblies, enters them.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd25"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of nobles. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd26"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of brahmans. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd27"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of householders. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd28"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of recluses. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd29"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of the retinue of the Four Great Regents. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd30"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of the Thirty-Three. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd31"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred of Mara's assemblies. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd32"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, call to mind approaching many hundred assemblies of Brahmas. Yet before I sat down there and before I held converse there and before I fell into conversation there, I did not behold, Sāriputta, any ground for thinking that fear or nervousness would come upon me there. So I, Sāriputta, not beholding this ground, fare along attained to security, attained to fearlessness, attained to conviction.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd33"></a>Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus, seeing me thus, should speak thus: ‘There are no states of further-men, (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i> on (a system of) his own devising beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation’ if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta, if he does not retract that thought, if he does not give up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd34"></a>Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit, endowed with concentration, endowed with intuitive wisdom, might attain profound knowledge here-now, so I say that this, Sāriputta, results thus: <a class="pts" id="pts1.73"></a>Not retracting that speech, not retracting that thought, not giving up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd35"></a>These, Sāriputta, are the four modes of life. What are the four? The mode of life born from an egg, the mode of life born from a womb, the mode of life born from moisture, the mode of life of spontaneous uprising.</p>
<p><span class="add">(1)</span> And what, Sāriputta, is the mode of life born from an egg? Whatever beings are produced, Sāriputta, breaking through an egg-shell, this, Sāriputta, is called the mode of life born from an egg.</p>
<p><span class="add">(2)</span> And what, Sāriputta, is the mode of life born from a womb? Whatever beings are produced, Sāriputta, breaking through a membranous sheath, this, Sāriputta, is called the mode of life born from a womb.</p>
<p><span class="add">(3)</span> And what, Sāriputta, is the <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en98"></a>mode of life born of moisture? Whatever beings are produced, Sāriputta, in rotting fish or in rotting corpses or rotting rice or in a dirty pool near a village, this, Sāriputta, is called the mode of life born of moisture.</p>
<p><span class="add">(4)</span> And what, Sāriputta, is the mode of life of spontaneous uprising? Devas, those in Niraya Hell, and some men and some in the sorrowful state, this is called, Sāriputta, the mode of life of spontaneous uprising.</p>
<p>These, Sāriputta, are the four modes of life.</p>
<span class="note" hidden>Editor's note: The refrain ‘Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus…’ has been omitted here as this certainly belongs as the prelude to the next section and there is no statement in this group by the Buddha of his having special knowledge in this regard. In this way this and the next sections become his statement about his knowledge of the comings and goings of beings. It does appear in the Pali and (abridged) in Ms. Horner's translation, but makes no sense.</span>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd36"></a>These, Sāriputta, are the five bourns. What are the five? Niraya Hell, animal birth, the realm of the departed, men, devas.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd1"></a>I, Sāriputta, comprehend Niraya Hell and the way leading to Niraya Hell and the course leading to Niraya Hell, and that according to how one is faring along one uprises, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell, that too I comprehend.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd37"></a>And I, Sāriputta, comprehend animal birth and the way leading to animal birth and the course leading to animal birth, and that according to how one is faring along one uprises, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in animal birth, that too I comprehend.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd38"></a>And I, Sāriputta, comprehend the realm of the departed and the way leading to the realm of the departed and the course leading to the realm of the departed, and that according to how one is faring along one uprises, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in the realm of the departed, that too I comprehend.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd39"></a>And I, Sāriputta, comprehend men, and the way leading to the world of men and the course leading to the world of men, and that according to how one is faring along one uprises, at the breaking up of the body after dying, among men, that too I comprehend.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd40"></a>And I, Sāriputta, comprehend devas and the way leading to deva-worlds and the course leading to deva-worlds, and that according to how one is faring along one uprises, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in a good <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en99"></a>bourn, a heaven-world, that too I comprehend.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd41"></a>And I, Sāriputta, comprehend nibbāna and the way leading to nibbāna and the course leading to nibbāna,<a class="pts" id="pts1.74"></a> and that according to how one is faring along, by the destruction of the cankers one enters on and abides in the freedom of mind, the freedom through intuitive wisdom which are cankerless, having realised them here-now by one's own super-knowledge, that too I comprehend.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd42"></a>(1) Now I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered that way, so will he arise at the breaking up of the body after dying in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. After a time I see by purified deva vision, surpassing that of men that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell, and is experiencing feelings that are exclusively painful, sharp, severe. Sāriputta, it is as if there were a pit of charcoal, deeper than man's height, full of embers that are neither flaming nor smoking; then a man might come along overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat, exhausted, parched and thirsty, heading direct for that pit of charcoal itself by the one sole way. A man with vision, having seen him, might say: ‘As that good man is faring along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he come to that pit of charcoal itself.’ After a time he may see him, fallen into that charcoal pit, experiencing feelings that are exclusively painful, sharp, severe. Even so do I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise at the breaking up of the body after dying in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. After a time I see by purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad born, the abyss, Niraya Hell, and is experiencing feelings that are exclusively painful, sharp, severe.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd43"></a>(2) Then I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in an animal birth. After a time I see with <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en100"></a>purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen in an animal birth and is experiencing feelings which are painful, sharp, severe. Sāriputta, it is as if there were a cesspool, deeper than a man's height, full of filth; then a man might come along overcome<a class="pts" id="pts1.75"></a> and overpowered by the hot-weather heat, exhausted, parched and thirsty, heading direct for that cesspool itself by the one sole way. A man with vision, having seen him, might say: ‘As that good man is faring along, and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he come to that cesspool itself.’ After a time he may see him, fallen into that cesspool and experiencing feelings that are painful, sharp, severe.

After a time I see with purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen in an animal birth and is experiencing feelings which are painful, sharp, severe. Then I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in the realm of the departed. After a time I see I see with purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen in the realm of the departed and is experiencing feelings that are abundantly painful. Sāriputta, it is like a tree growing on uneven ground, with sparse leaves and foliage (giving) patchy shade. Then a man might come along overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat, exhausted, parched and thirsty, heading direct for that tree itself by the one sole way. A man with vision, having seen him, might say: ‘As that good man is faring along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he come to that tree itself.’ After a time he may see him sitting down or lying down in the shade of that tree, experiencing feelings that are abundantly painful.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd44"></a>(3) Even so do I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in the realm of the departed.

<p><a class="bd" id="bd45"></a>(4) Then I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise, at the breaking up of the body after dying, among men. After a time I see I see with purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen among men and is experiencing feelings that are abundantly pleasant. Sāriputta, it is like a tree growing <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en101"></a>on even ground, with dense leaves and foliage (giving) thick shade. Then a man might come along overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat, exhausted, parched, thirsty, heading direct for that tree itself by the one sole way. A man with vision, having seen him, might speak thus: ‘As that good man is faring along, and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so he will come to that tree itself.’ After a time he may see him sitting down or lying down in the shade of that tree, experiencing feelings that are abundantly pleasant. Even so do I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise, at the breaking up of the body after dying, among men.

<p><a class="bd" id="bd46"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.76"></a>(5) Then I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in a good bourn, a heaven world. After a time I see I see with purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world and is experiencing feelings that are exclusively pleasant. Sāriputta, it is as if there were a long house where there might be a building with a gabled roof, smeared inside and out, protected from the wind, with bolts that are fastened, windows that are closed. Therein might be a divan spread with a long-haired coverlet, spread with a white coverlet, spread with a wool coverlet besprent with flowers, a splendid sheeting of the hide of the <i>kadali</i>-deer, with an awning overhead and a scarlet cushion at either end. Then a man might come along overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat, exhausted, parched, thirsty, heading direct for that long house itself by the one sole way. A man with vision, having seen him, might say: ‘As that good<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en102"></a> man is faring along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he come to that long house itself.’ After a time he may see him sitting down or lying down in that long house, in that building with the gabled roof, on that divan, experiencing feelings that are exclusively pleasant. Even so do I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he arise, at the breaking up of the body after dying, in a good bourn, a heaven world. After a time I see I see with purified deva vision, surpassing that of men, that, at the breaking up of the body after dying, he has arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world and is experiencing feelings that are exclusively pleasant. Then I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person fares along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he, by the destruction of the cankers, enter and abide in the freedom of mind, the freedom through intuitive wisdom that are cankerless, having realised them here-now by his own super-knowledge. After a time I see that he, by the destruction of the cankers, having entered on freedom of mind, freedom through intuitive wisdom that are cankerless, and having realised them here-now by his own super-knowledge, is abiding in them, experiencing feelings that are exclusively pleasant. Sāriputta, it is as if there were a lovely lotus-pool with clear water, sweet water, cool water, limpid, with beautiful banks, and close to it a dim forest thicket. Then a man might come along overcome and overpowered by the hot-weather heat, exhausted, parched and thirsty, heading direct for that pond itself by the one sole way. A man with vision, having seen him, might say: ‘As that good man is faring along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he come to that lotus-pool itself.’ After a time he may see that he has plunged into that lotus-pool, has bathed in it and drunk of it, and having allayed all distress, exhaustion and fever, has got out again and is sitting down <a class="pts" id="pts1.77"></a> or lying down in that forest thicket experiencing feelings that are exclusively pleasant. Even so do I, Sāriputta, with my mind comprehend the mind of some person thus: As that person is faring along and as he is going along and has entered on that way, so will he, by the destruction of the cankers, having entered on freedom of mind, freedom through <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en103"></a>intuitive wisdom that are cankerless, having realised them here-now by his own super-knowledge, abide therein. After a time I see that he, by the destruction of the cankers, having entered on freedom of mind, freedom through intuitive wisdom that are cankerless, having realised them here-now by his own super-knowledge, is abiding therein, experiencing feelings that are exclusively pleasant.</p>
<p>These, Sāriputta, are the five bourns.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd47"></a>Whoever, Sāriputta, knowing me thus, seeing me thus, should speak thus: ‘There are no states of further-men, (no) excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans in the recluse Gotama; the recluse Gotama teaches <i>Dhamma</i> on (a system of) his own devising beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation’ if he does not retract that speech, Sāriputta, if he does not retract that thought, if he does not give up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd48"></a>Sāriputta, as a monk, endowed with moral habit, endowed with concentration, endowed with intuitive wisdom, might attain profound knowledge here-now, so I say that this, Sāriputta, results thus: Not retracting that speech, not retracting that thought, not giving up that view, he is consigned to Niraya Hell just as a burden is set aside.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd49"></a>Now I, Sāriputta, as one who fares, fully know a Brahma-faring that is endowed with four constituent parts: I became an ascetic, the foremost ascetic; I became loathly, the foremost loathly one; I became a detester, the foremost detester; I became aloof, the foremost aloof one.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd50"></a>In that, Sāriputta, there was this for me through asceticism:</p>
<p>I was unclothed, flouting life's decencies, licking my hands (after <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en104"></a>meals), not one to come when asked to do so, not one to stand still when asked to do so.</p>
<p>I did not consent (to accept food) offered to (me) or specially prepared for (me) nor to (accept) an invitation (to a meal).</p>
<p>I did not accept (food) straight from a cooking pot or pan, nor within the threshold, nor among the faggots, nor among the rice-pounders, nor when two people were eating, nor from a pregnant woman, nor from one giving suck, nor from one co-habiting with a man, nor from gleanings, nor near where a dog is standing, nor where flies are swarming, nor fish, nor meat.</p>
<p>I drank neither fermented liquor nor spirits nor rice-gruel.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd51"></a>I was a one-house-man, a one-piece-man, <a class="pts" id="pts1.78"></a> or a two-house-man, a two-piece-man or a three-house-man, a three-piece-man or a four-house-man, a four-piece-man or a five-house-man, a five-piece-man or a six-house-man, a six-piece-man or a seven-house-man, a seven-piece-man.</p>
<p>I subsisted on one little offering, and I subsisted on two little offerings and I subsisted on three little offerings and I subsisted on four little offerings and I subsisted on five little offerings and I subsisted on six little offerings and I subsisted on seven little offerings.</p>
<p>I took food only once a day, and once in two days and once in three days and once in four days and once in five days and once in six days and once in seven days.</p>
<p>Then I lived intent on the practice of eating rice at regular fort-nightly intervals.</p>
<p>I came to be one feeding on potherbs or feeding on millet or on wild rice or on snippets of skin or on water-plants or on the red powder of rice husks or on the discarded scum of rice on the boil or on the flour of oil-seeds or grass or cowdung.</p>
<p>I was one who subsisted on forest roots and fruits, eating the fruits that had fallen.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd52"></a>I wore coarse hempen cloths, and I wore mixed cloths, and I wore cerements, and I wore rags taken from the dust heap, and I wore tree-bark fibre, and I wore antelope skins, and I wore strips of antelope skin, and I wore cloths of kusa-grass, and I wore cloths of bark, and I wore cloths of wood shavings, and I wore <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en105"></a>a blanket of human hair, and I wore a blanket of animal hair, and I wore owls’ feathers.</p>
<p>I was one who plucked out the hair of his head and beard, intent on the practice of plucking out the hair of head and beard.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd53"></a>I became one who stood upright, refusing a seat; I became one who squats on his haunches, intent on the practice of squatting.</p>
<p>I became one for covered thorns, I made my bed on covered thorns; and I was intent on the practice of going down to the water to bathe up to three times in an evening.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd54"></a>Thus in many a way did I live intent on the practice of mortifying and tormenting my body.</p>
<p>This then was for me, Sāriputta, through asceticism.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd55"></a>In that, Sāriputta, there was this for me through loathliness:</p>
<p>On my body there accumulated the dust and dirt of years, so that it fell off in shreds. Just as the stump of the tindukā-tree comes to accumulate the dust and dirt of years, so that it falls off in shreds, even so, Sāriputta, on my body there accumulated the dust and dirt of years, so that it fell off in shreds. But it did not occur to me, Sāriputta, to think: ‘Indeed now, I could rub off this dust and dirt with my hand, or others could rub off this dust and dirt for me with their hands.’ It did not occur to me thus, Sāriputta.</p>
<p>This then was for me, Sāriputta, through loathliness.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd56"></a>In that, Sāriputta, there was this for me through detesting:</p>
<p>Sāriputta, whether I was going out, whether I was returning, there was set up in me kindliness even towards a drop of water, and I thought: ‘Do not let me bring small creatures in their various places to destruction.’</p>
<p>This then was for me, Sāriputta, through detesting.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd57"></a>In that, Sāriputta, there was this for me through aloofness:</p>
<p><a class="pts" id="pts1.79"></a>If I had plunged into a certain stretch of forest, and if I saw a cow-herd or a cattle-herd or a gatherer of grass or sticks or anyone roaming about for bulbs and roots and so on, I fled from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from low ground to low ground, from high ground to high ground. What was the reason for this? <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en106"></a>I thought: ‘Do not let them see me, do not let me see them.’ Even as a deer in the forest, Sāriputta, having seen a man, flees from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from low ground to low ground, from high ground to high ground, even so did I, Sāriputta, when I saw a cow-herd or a cattle-herd or a gatherer of grass or sticks or anyone roaming about for bulbs and roots and so on, flee from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from low ground to low ground, from high ground to high ground. What was the reason for this? I thought: ‘Do not let them see me, do not let me see them.’</p>
<p>This then was for me, Sāriputta, through aloofness.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd58"></a>Then I, Sāriputta, having approached on all fours those cow-pens that the cows had quitted, the cow-herds having departed, I subsisted there on the droppings of the young suckling calves. So long as my own dung and urine held out, I subsisted on that. This then was for me, Sāriputta, through partaking of the great filthy things.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd59"></a>Then I, Sāriputta, having plunged into a terrifying forest thicket, stayed there. It comes to be said of a terrifying forest thicket, because it is so terrifying; ‘Whoever, not rid of attachment, enters that forest thicket, his hair stands on end.’</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd60"></a>Then I, Sāriputta, during the cold winter nights, between the ‘eights’ in a time of snowfall, spent such nights as these in the open air, the days in the forest thicket. I spent the days of the last month of the hot weather in the open air, the nights in the forest thicket.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd61"></a>Then, Sāriputta, this verse, never heard before, occurred spontaneously to me:</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p>Now scorched, now cold, alone in terrifying forest,<br>
Naked and sitting fireless, the sage is intent on his quest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd62"></a>Then I, Sāriputta, lay down to sleep in a cemetery, leaning on a skeleton. Cowherds’ boys, having come up to me, spat and staled on me, and showered me with dust and stuck twigs into my<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en107"></a> ears. But I, Sāriputta, well know that I was not the creator of a malign heart against them. This then came to be for me, Sāriputta, through abiding in even-mindedness.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd63"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.80"></a>There are, Sāriputta, some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through food.’ These speak thus: ‘We subsist on jujube fruits.’ and they eat jujube fruits and they eat crushed jujube fruits and they drink jujube fruit water, and they make use of jujube fruits in a variety of ways. Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted on one single jujube fruit. It may be, Sāriputta, that this occurs to you: ‘But at that time the jujube fruit was large.’ But this must not be regarded in this way, Sāriputta, for the jujube fruit was then as it is now.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd64"></a>While I, Sāriputta, was subsisting on one single jujube fruit, my body became exceedingly emaciated. Because I ate so little, all my limbs became like the knotted joints of withered creepers; because I ate so little, my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof; because I ate so little, my protruding backbone became like a string of balls; because I ate so little, my gaunt ribs became like the crazy rafters of a tumble-down shed; because I ate so little, the pupils of my eyes appeared lying low and deep in their sockets as sparkles of water in a deep well appear lying low and deep; because I ate so little, my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk as a bitter white gourd cut before it is ripe becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind. If I, Sāriputta, thought: ‘I will touch the skin of my belly.’ it was my backbone that I took hold of. If I thought: ‘I will touch my backbone.’ it was the skin of my belly that I took hold of. For because I ate so little, the skin on my belly, Sāriputta, came to be cleaving to my backbone. If I, Sāriputta, thought: ‘I will obey the calls of nature.’ I fell down on my face then and there, because I ate so little. If I, Sāriputta, soothing my body, stroked my limbs with my hand, the hairs, rotted at the roots, fell away from my body as I stroked my limbs with my hand, because I ate so little.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd65"></a>There are, Sāriputta, some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through food.’ These speak thus: ‘We subsist on beans.’ and they eat beans and they eat crushed beans <a class="pts" id="pts1.81"></a> and they drink bean water, and they make use of beans in a variety of ways. Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted on one single bean. It may be, Sāriputta, that this occurs to you: ‘But at that time the bean was large.’ But this must not be regarded in this way, Sāriputta, for the bean was then as it is now.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd66"></a>While I, Sāriputta, was subsisting on one single bean, my body became exceedingly emaciated. Because I ate so little, all my limbs became like the knotted joints of withered creepers; because I ate so little, my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof; because I ate so little, my protruding backbone became like a string of balls; because I ate so little, my gaunt ribs became like the crazy rafters of a tumble-down shed; because I ate so little, the pupils of my eyes appeared lying low and deep in their sockets as sparkles of water in a deep well appear lying low and deep; because I ate so little, my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk as a bitter white gourd cut before it is ripe becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind. If I, Sāriputta, thought: ‘I will touch the skin of my belly.’ it was my backbone that I took hold of. If I thought: ‘I will touch my backbone.’ it was the skin of my belly that I took hold of.

If I, Sāriputta, soothing my body, stroked my limbs with my hand, the hairs, rotted at the roots, fell away from my body as I stroked my limbs with my hand, because I ate so little.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd67"></a>There are, Sāriputta, some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through food.’ These speak thus: ‘We subsist on sesamum.’ and they eat sesamum and they eat crushed sesamum and they drink sesamum water, and they make use of sesamum in a variety of ways. Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted on one single sesamum. It may be, Sāriputta, that this occurs to you: ‘But at that time the sesamum was large.’ But this must not be regarded in this way, Sāriputta, for the sesamum was then as it is now.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd68"></a>While I, Sāriputta, was subsisting on one single sesamum, my body became exceedingly emaciated. Because I ate so little, all my limbs became like the knotted joints of withered creepers; because I ate so little, my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof; because I ate so little, my protruding backbone became like a string of balls; because I ate so little, my gaunt ribs became like the crazy rafters of a tumble-down shed; because I ate so little, the pupils of my eyes appeared lying low and deep in their sockets as sparkles of water in a deep well appear lying low and deep; because I ate so little, my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk as a bitter white gourd cut before it is ripe becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind.

If I, Sāriputta, soothing my body, stroked my limbs with my hand, the hairs, rotted at the roots, fell away from my body as I stroked my limbs with my hand, because I ate so little.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd69"></a>There are, Sāriputta, some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through food.’ These speak thus: ‘We subsist on rice-grains.’ and they eat rice-grains and they eat crushed<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en108"></a> rice-grains and they drink rice-grain water, and they make use of rice-grains in a variety of ways. Now I, Sāriputta, claim to have subsisted on one single rice-grain. It may be, Sāriputta, that this occurs to you: ‘But at that time the rice-grain was large.’ But this must not be regarded in this way, Sāriputta, for the rice-grain was then as it is now.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd70"></a>While I, Sāriputta, was subsisting on one single rice-grain, my body became exceedingly emaciated. Because I ate so little, all my limbs became like the knotted joints of withered creepers; because I ate so little, my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof; because I ate so little, my protruding backbone became like a string of balls; because I ate so little, my gaunt ribs became like the crazy rafters of a tumble-down shed; because I ate so little, the pupils of my eyes appeared lying low and deep in their sockets as sparkles of water in a deep well appear lying low and deep; because I ate so little, my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk as a bitter white gourd cut before it is ripe becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind.

If I, Sāriputta, soothing my body, stroked my limbs with my hand, the hairs, rotted at the roots, fell away from my body as I stroked my limbs with my hand, because I ate so little. But I, Sāriputta, even by this procedure, by this course, by this mortification, did not reach states of further-men or the excellent knowledge and insight befitting the ariyans. What was the cause of this? It was that by these there is no reaching the ariyan intuitive wisdom which, when reached, is ariyan, leading onwards, and which leads onwards the doer of it to the complete destruction of anguish.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd71"></a>Now, Sāriputta, there are some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through faring on.’ But, Sāriputta, it is not easy to find that faring-on <a class="pts" id="pts1.82"></a>that I have not formerly fared-on in during this long past except among the devas of the Pure Abodes. For if I, Sāriputta, were to have fared on among the devas of the Pure Abodes, I could not have come back again to this world.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd72"></a>Now, Sāriputta, there are some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through uprising. But, Sāriputta, it is not easy to find that uprising that has not formerly been uprisen in by me during this long past, except among the devas of the Pure Abodes. For if I, Sāriputta, were to have uprisen among the devas of the Pure Abodes, I could not have come back again to this world.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd73"></a>Now, Sāriputta, there are some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through abode.’ But, Sāriputta, it is not easy to find that abode that I have not abided in during this long past, except among the devas of the Pure Abodes. For if I, Sāriputta, were to have abided among the devas of the Pure Abodes, I could not have come back again to this world.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd74"></a>Now, Sāriputta, there are some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through oblation.’ But, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en109"></a>Sāriputta, it is not easy to find that oblation that has not formerly been offered by me during this long past when I was a noble, anointed king, or a wealthy brahman.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd75"></a>Now, Sāriputta, there are some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘Purity is through tending the (sacrificial) fire.’ But, Sāriputta, it is not easy to find that fire that has not formerly been tended by me during this long past when I was a noble, anointed king, or a wealthy brahman.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd76"></a>Now, Sāriputta, there are some recluses and brahmans who speak thus and are of this view: ‘So long as this good man is young, endowed with the coal-black hair of youth, in his early prime, so long is he possessed of the utmost lucidity of wisdom. But when this good man is worn, old, stricken in years, has lived his span, and is at the close of his life, eighty or ninety or a hundred years of age, then he falls from that lucidity of wisdom.’ But this is not to be regarded in this way, Sāriputta. I, Sāriputta, am now worn, old, stricken in years, I have lived my span, and am at the close of my life, being round about eighty. Sāriputta, I might have four disciples here, each of a hundred years’ life-span, living a hundred years, and possessed of the utmost mindfulness, and attentiveness, and resolute energy, and with the utmost lucidity of wisdom. As, Sāriputta, a skilled archer, trained, deft, a marksman, may with ease wing a slender shaft across a palm-tree's shadow, so are these of extreme mindfulness, of extreme attentiveness, <a class="pts" id="pts1.83"></a>of extreme resolute energy, so are they possessed of the utmost lucidity of wisdom. If these were to ask me again and again a question about the four applications of mindfulness, and if I, questioned again and again, were to explain to them, and if they, on being explained to by me, should understand as explained, and if they were not to question me about any secondary and further matter (nor pause), except for feeding, drinking, eating, tasting, except for answering the calls of nature, except for dispelling fatigue by sleep, still unfinished, Sāriputta, would be the Tathāgata teaching of <i>Dhamma</i>, still unfinished would be the Tathāgata expositions on the phrases of <i>Dhamma</i>, still unfinished would be the Tathāgata ways of <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en110"></a>putting questions when these four disciples of mine, of life-spans of a hundred years, living for a hundred years, would pass away at the end of a hundred years. Yet, if you should have to carry me about on a litter, Sāriputta, verily there is no change in the Tathāgata's lucidity of wisdom.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd77"></a>Whoever, Sāriputta, speaking rightly, should say: ‘A being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare of the manyfolk, for the happiness of the manyfolk, out of compassion for the world, for the good, the welfare, the happiness of devas and men.’ so, when he is speaking rightly of me, he would say: ‘A being not liable to delusion has arisen in the world for the welfare of the manyfolk, for the happiness of the manyfolk, out of compassion for the world, for the good, the welfare, the happiness of devas and men.’”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd78"></a>Now at that time the venerable Nāgasamāla spoke thus to the Lord: “It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous, Lord, that when, Lord, this disquisition on <i>Dhamma</i> had been heard by me, my hair stood on end. What is the name, Lord, of this disquisition on <i>Dhamma</i>?”</p>
<p>“Wherefore do you, Nāgasamāla, remember this disquisition on <i>Dhamma</i> as the Hair-raising Disquisition.”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd79"></a>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted the venerable Nāgasamāla rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
