Therefore, should the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika be the first to offer alms-food, that would bring them benefit, welfare, and happiness for a long time. What if I, aiming at their happiness, encourage them to offer alms-food?”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.5' href='#wal2.5'>Wal 2.5</a>Then that god, having pervaded the merchant’s caravan of wagons with light, said this to the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika:</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.7' href='#wal2.7'>Wal 2.7</a>Then the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika thought thus: “This Buddha cannot be an ordinary person, nor can this be an ordinary declaration of the Dharma, if even this god encourages us to offer alms-food to him, the Tathāgata, arahant, and fully Awakened Buddha.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.8' href='#wal2.8'>Wal 2.8</a>Then the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika took much rice-cake and honey-lumps to the Blessed One.</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal20.4' href='#wal20.4'>Wal 20.4</a>Seated at one side, the fifty most excellent village lads said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal20.5' href='#wal20.5'>Wal 20.5</a>“Venerable Sir, we wish to gain the going forth, the full entrance to monkhood in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya. We would live the spiritual life in the presence of the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal20.6' href='#wal20.6'>Wal 20.6</a>“Venerables, you have gained the the going forth, the full entrance to monkhood in the well-proclaimed Dharma and Vinaya. Now that you have gone forth, Venerables, you should dwell alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal20.7' href='#wal20.7'>Wal 20.7</a>Dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, they realised in this very life with their own direct knowledge and entered into the unexcelled culmination of the spiritual life for the sake of which those sons of families shaved off their hair and beards and put on the dyed robe, rightly going forth from the home life to homelessness. They understood that: “Birth is ended, the spiritual life is fulfilled, done is what had to be done, there is no return to this existence.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal20.8' href='#wal20.8'>Wal 20.8</a>Now on that occasion there were sixty arahants in the world, with the Blessed One as sixty-first.</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.1' href='#wal21.1'>Wal 21.1</a>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine. You too are freed from all snares, both human and divine. Wander, monks, for the welfare of the many-folk, for the happiness of the many-folk, out of compassion for the benefit of the world, for the welfare and happiness of gods and men. Let not two go by the one road! Also, I will go to Uruvelā, to the village of Senāyana.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.2' href='#wal21.2'>Wal 21.2</a><span class='add'>Then Māra the wicked thought: “The Blessed One has addressed the monks thus: ‘Monks, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine.

Let not two go by the one road! Also, I will go to Uruvelā, to the village of Senāyana.’ What if I were to approach him and create a vision?”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.3' href='#wal21.3'>Wal 21.3</a>Then Māra the wicked transformed his body into the appearance of a student and approached the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.4' href='#wal21.4'>Wal 21.4</a>Having approached at that time he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Unfreed, he perceives he is free,<br>
How can he imagine he is free?<br>
You are tied with great ties!<br>
Ascetic, you will not escape me!”</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.5' href='#wal21.5'>Wal 21.5</a>Then the Blessed One thought thus: “Māra the wicked has approached me and created a vision.” Knowing this, the Blessed One at that time spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“I am free from all snares,<br>
Both human and divine.<br>
I know you, wicked one!<br>
You are destroyed right here, terminator!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.6' href='#wal21.6'>Wal 21.6</a>Then Māra the wicked thought: “The ascetic Gotama knows me by encompassing my mind with his.” Realising this, sad, depressed, and remorseful, he vanished right there.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.7' href='#wal21.7'>Wal 21.7</a>The Blessed One addressed the monks once more: “Monks, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine. You too are freed from all snares, both human and divine. Wander, monks, for the welfare of the many-folk (…as before, up until…) Also, I will go to Uruvelā, to the village of Senāyana.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.8' href='#wal21.8'>Wal 21.8</a>“Yes, Venerable Sir”, those monks assented to the Blessed One, and departed to wander the nations.</p>
