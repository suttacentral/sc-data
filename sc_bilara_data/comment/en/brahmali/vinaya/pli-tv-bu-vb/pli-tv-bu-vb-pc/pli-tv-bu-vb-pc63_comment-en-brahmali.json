  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63:1.3": "The Pali appears as a single sentence enclosed in quotes. Yet it is hard to see how this could have been spoken in one go, since some of the constituent clauses are mutually contradictory. For instance, the same legal procedure cannot have been both not done and badly done. I therefore take it that the individual clauses were spoken at different times. This method of putting together a number of independent utterances into a single quote is in fact quite common in the Vinaya Piṭaka. In most such cases I separate out the individual quotes. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63:2.1.6": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, _so vā āroceti_, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “_sa (sā) āroceti_ (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. [Sanskrit] _ārocayate_ med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 29 [Bu Pc 29:3.1.6](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:3.1.6) where the text says that she tells (_sā vā āroceti_) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case _āroceti_ cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it refers to the Sangha, or perhaps one of the monks who participated in the _saṅghakamma_, having told him directly. "
