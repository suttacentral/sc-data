  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:4.4": "[Bu Pc 85:4.4](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85:4.4) has ellipses points at the end of this sentence, but not so the PTS version. In fact, the ellipses points do not fit, since they imply that the monk gets robbed (as above), which does not suit the context. I therefore follow the PTS punctuation. "
