  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc64:2.1.8": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, _so vā āroceti_, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “_sa (sā) āroceti_ (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. [Sanskrit] _ārocayate_ med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 29 [Bu Pc 29:3.1.6](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:3.1.6) where the text says that she tells (_sā vā āroceti_) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case _āroceti_ cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it simply refers to the other monk telling him directly. "
