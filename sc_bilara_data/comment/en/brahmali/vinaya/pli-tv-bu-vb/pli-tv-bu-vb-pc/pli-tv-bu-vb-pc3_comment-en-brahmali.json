  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:1.20.1": "This is translated somewhat freely in accordance with the explanation below and in the commentary. According to [Bu Pc 3:2.3.1](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.3.1) the offense is only incurred when a monk brings the words of another monk to the attention of yet another monk, and thus the translation “between monks”. Sp.2.37 supports the plural rendering “monks”: _Bhikkhūnaṁ pesuññe_, “Malicious talebearing of monks”. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.24": "I have added the ellipses points, which are presumably missing in the Pali due to an editing mistake, cf.[Bu Pc 3:2.2.22](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.22). The ellipses points are also missing at [Bu Pc 3:2.2.26](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.26). ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3:2.2.27": "This looks like an editing mistake. Presumably this should read, “We’re not going to a good destination/we can only expect a bad destination.” "
