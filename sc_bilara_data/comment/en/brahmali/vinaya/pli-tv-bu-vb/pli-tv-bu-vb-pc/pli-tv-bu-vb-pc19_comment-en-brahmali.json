In later Buddhism the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i> is the name of a mythological marine animal, but what it refers to in this context is not clear. According to <a href='/Sp-yoj.3.243/en/brahmali'>SP YOJ.3.243</a> <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i> is the name of a certain species of fish: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Makaradantaketi makaranāmakassa macchassa dantasadise dante</i>, “Teeth like the teeth of a fish called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i>.” According to <a href='/Vin-vn-ṭ.3048/en/brahmali'>VIN VN ṭ.3048</a>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Makaradantakanti girikūṭākāraṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Makaradantaka</i> means making (a design) like the peak of a hill.” PED suggests “the tooth of a swordfish”, but apparently swordfish do not have teeth. Given that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i> were fearsome creatures and that their teeth looked like the peak of a hill, presumably meaning that their teeth were pointed, “shark teeth” seems like a reasonable guess. | “The fivefold pattern” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pañcapaṭika</i>. <a href='/Vmv.4.299/en/brahmali'>VMV.4.299</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pāḷiyaṁ pañcapaṭikanti jātiādipañcappakāravaṇṇamaṭṭhaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pañcapaṭika</i> in the canonical text means treated with the color of the five kinds, starting with jasmine.” The meaning is not clear.
