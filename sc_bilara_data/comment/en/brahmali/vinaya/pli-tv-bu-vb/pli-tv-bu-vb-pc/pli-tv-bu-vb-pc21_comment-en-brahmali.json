  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.16": "“Are you all here” renders _samaggāttha_, literally, “Are you united”. Sp 2.149: _Samaggātthāti sabbā āgatatthāti attho_, “Are you united: the meaning is, ‘Have you all come?’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.18": "For the meaning of _niyyādetabbo_ in this context, see the usage in the origin story to the next rule, [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.9](). Sp 2.149: _Niyyādetabboti appetabbo_ … _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvāti eso bhaginiyo ovādoti avatvā_, “_Niyyādetabbo_: should display it. … _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvā_: not having said, ‘Sisters, this is the instruction.’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.19": "Sp 2.149: _Osāretabboti pāḷi vattabbā_, “_Osāretabbo_: the Canonical text is to be spoken.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.20": "“Acts of respect” renders _sāmīcikammaṁ_. Sp 2.149: _sāmīcikammanti maggasampadānabījanapānīyāpucchanādikaṁ anucchavikavattaṁ_, “_Sāmīcikammaṁ_ means appropriate duties such as giving way, fanning, offering drinking water, etc.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.22": "The Pali word behind the translation “monastery” is _āvāsa_. This refers to the area of the _simā_, the monastic zone, as established through a legal procedure. This area may be much larger than the space occupied by any actual buildings. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.30": "Heavy offense, _garudhamma_, here refers to the _saṅghādisesa_ offenses, the offenses entailing suspension. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.36": "“Correct” renders _vacanapatha_. For the meaning of this word, see BVS, pp.73–76. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.38": "It is not entirely clear how this offense comes about, but it must somehow relate to what we find in segment 3.1.17 above. It seems the text here assumes that the nuns reply “no” to the follow-up question in segment 3.1.17 of whether they are keeping the important principles, in which case the appointed monk is supposed to recite them. Only if he does not do so at this point, does he incur an offense of wrong conduct under this rule. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.40": "“He does not give the instruction” renders _ovādaṁ aniyyādetvā_. Sp 2.149: _Ovādaṁ aniyyādetvāti eso bhaginiyo ovādoti avatvā_ “He does not give the instruction: not having said, ‘Sisters, this is the instruction.’” This seems a bit contrived, but in light of segment 3.1.18 above and the origin story to [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.9]() perhaps it is nevertheless the right interpretation.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.3.4": "That _osāreti_ must mean “recite” can be seen from [pli-tv-bu-vb-pc4:2.3.5]() where there is no offense if _osārentaṁ opāteti_, “he prompts one who is _osārentaṁ_.” The difference between _uddesaṁ deti_ and _osāreti_ is not clear to me. "
