If you have an agreement with a close friend, you may take their belongings on trust. In this particular case, you assign the robe-cloth to such a friend, which then enables you to take the robe-cloth back should you need it. (The place where the robe-cloth is stored seems to be irrelevant.) This explains why the other monk says, “Please use their property, give it away, or do as you like with it.” The conditions for taking on trust are set out at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#19.1.5'>Kd 8:19.1.5</a>.
