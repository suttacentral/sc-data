  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:1.48": "Sp-ṭ.3.295: _Sarīsapeti ye keci sarante gacchante dīghajātike_, “_Sarīsape_: whatever long creature are moving by flowing.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:2.1.6": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, _so vā āroceti_, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “_sa (sā) āroceti_ (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. [Sanskrit] _ārocayate_ med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 29 [Bu Pc 29:3.1.6](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:3.1.6) where the text says that she tells (_sā vā āroceti_) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case _āroceti_ cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it simply refers to the person wrongly ordained telling the monk directly. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65:2.1.10": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet elsewhere, such as _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10-13, it is said that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
