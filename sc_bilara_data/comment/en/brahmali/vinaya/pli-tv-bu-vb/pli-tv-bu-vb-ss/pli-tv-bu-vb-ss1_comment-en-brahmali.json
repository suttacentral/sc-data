For the meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mānatta</i> see TAP, p.123. | The point here, which can only be understood from the Pali, is that the word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅghādisesa</i> (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅgha</i> + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ādisesa</i>) is derived from the fact that only the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sangha</i> can do the legal procedures required when a monastic commits this offense. | “Several” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sambahula</i>. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sambahula</i> normally means “many” or “a number of”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka, however, such as the present context, it is also used in a technical sense to mean a number of monastics greater than one but less than a Sangha, in other words, two or three monastics. In these instances, I render <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sambahula</i> as “several”. In the Campeyyakkhandhaka at Vin 5.174, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sambahula</i> is used in an even more restricted sense. There it refers to more than two monastics but less than a Sangha, that is, exactly three monastics. In that context I render it simply as “three”. ",
