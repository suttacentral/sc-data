For the meaning of _mānatta_ see “A Translation and Analysis of the Pātimokkha”, by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita, p.123. | The point here, which can only be understood from the Pali, is that the word _saṅghādisesa_ (_saṅgha_ + _ādisesa_) is derived from the fact that only the _sangha_ can do the legal procedures required when a monastic commits this offense.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:5.9.7": "Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues in Buddhist Monastic Code I, page 105, that it was the novice monk who emitted semen. But these rules concern monks, not novices. In the present case the Buddha specifically says that there is no offense of _saṅghādisea_, which would make no sense if it referred to the novice monk. Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues that his reading is required, otherwise we are forced to conclude that _saṅghādisea_ offenses can be incurred by indirect stimulation. Yet the cases found here are widely diverging. It is not given that they must all, potentially, be _saṅghādiseas_. ",
