  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5:4.4.19": "At first glance the Pali seems to concern a single wife who is protected in two ways, not two separate wives. However, since the immediately following question is phrased in the plural, _hotha … bhariyāyo dhanakkītā_, “please be the bought wives,” it is clear that this is about two wives. To bring this out in translation, I have added “so-and-so” to each potential wife. ",
