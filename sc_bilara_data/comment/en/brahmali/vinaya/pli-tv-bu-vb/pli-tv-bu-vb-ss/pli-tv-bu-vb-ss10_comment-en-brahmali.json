  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:1.1.3": "“Break its authority” renders _cakkabheda_. Sp.1.410: _Cakkabhedāyāti āṇābhedāya_, “_Cakkabhedāya_: by breaking the authority.” The break in authority is presumably both from the Buddha and the Sangha. Although the Buddha was the only authority in laying down rules, the Sangha was autonomous in its decision making. For practical purposes, it was the Sangha that Devadatta was breaking with. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.62": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet just below the text says that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
