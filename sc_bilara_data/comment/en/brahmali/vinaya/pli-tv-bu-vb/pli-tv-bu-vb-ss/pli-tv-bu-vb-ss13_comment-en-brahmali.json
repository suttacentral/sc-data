  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:1.8.2": "The meaning of the first of these phrases, _sammā vattati_, is straightforward, but the last two, _lomaṁ pāteti_ and _netthāraṁ vattati_, are more difficult. Sp 1.435: _Na lomaṁ pātentīti anulomapaṭipadaṁ appaṭipajjanatāya na pannalomā honti. Na netthāraṁ vattantīti attano nittharaṇamaggaṁ na paṭipajjanti_, “_Na lomaṁ pātenti_: because of their non-practicing in conformity with the path, their bodily hairs are not flat. _Na netthāraṁ vattanti_: they are not practicing the path for their own getting out (of the offense).” My rendering attempts to capture the meaning in a non-literal way. For the further development of these events, see [pli-tv-kd11:13.1.1]()–16.1.28. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.8": "For the rendering of _mattika_ and _cuṇṇa_ as respectively “soap” and “bath powder”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13:2.58": " The Pali just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet just below the text says that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
