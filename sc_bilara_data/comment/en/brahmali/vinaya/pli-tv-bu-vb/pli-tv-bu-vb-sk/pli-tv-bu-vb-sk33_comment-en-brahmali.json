According to Vin-vn-ṭ.1907 this is just another word for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>byañjana</i>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uttaribhaṅgaṁ nāma byañjanaṁ</i>. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Byañjana</i> seems to refer to curries apart from the standard bean-curries, which are called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sūpa</i>. However, since <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uttaribhaṅga</i> is a rare word, the basic meaning of which is something like “further condiments”, it is quite possible that it is here meant to include all foods apart from bean-curries.
