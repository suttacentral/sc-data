  "pli-tv-bu-vb-sk33:1.13": "_Uttaribhaṅga_. According to Vin-vn-ṭ.1907 this is just another word for _byañjana_: _uttaribhaṅgaṁ nāma byañjanaṁ_. _Byañjana_ seems to refer to curries apart from the standard bean-curries, which are called _sūpa_. However, since _uttaribhaṅga_ is a rare word, the basic meaning of which is something like “further condiments”, it is quite possible that it is here meant to include all foods apart from bean-curries.
