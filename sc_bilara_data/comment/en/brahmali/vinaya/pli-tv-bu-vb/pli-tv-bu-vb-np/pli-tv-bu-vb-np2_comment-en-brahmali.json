  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.3.3": "“Of the house” is added from the commentary.

If one is also unable to stay there, one should stay in a comfortable place wherever. Then, before dawn, one should go there, or one should not go beyond arm’s reach of that meeting hall or of the main gateway to the town.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.7.1": "The building at [pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.7.1](), the _māḷa_, is hard to distinguish from the next two buildings, the _pāsāda_ and the _hammiya_. In fact, according to Sp 1.482 they are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses”: _Māḷoti ekakūṭasaṅgahito caturassapāsādo. Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti muṇḍacchadanapāsādo_, “A _māḷa_ is a square stilt house with (a roof in) a single peak. A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is a stilt house with a bald roof.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful for practical purposes, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. For practical purposes, what these three buildings have in common—and this is what distinguishes them from the buildings at [pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.4.1]()–3.5.4, the _nivesana_ and the _uddosita_—is that they do not have an enclosed category.
