  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.3.3": "“Of the house” is added from the commentary. Sp 1.477: _Hatthapāsā vā na vijahitabbanti atha vā taṁ gharaṁ samantato hatthapāsā na vijahitabbaṁ_, “_Hatthapāsā vā na vijahitabbanti_: or one is not to go beyond arm’s reach from any point of that house.” Without this explanation it is hard to make out whether the arm’s reach is from the house or from the robe. In each instance below I have added the respective commentarial explanation, so as to make it clear what the arm’s reach relates to. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.3.4": "Sp 1.479: _Tesaṁyeva sabhāyadvāramūlānaṁ hatthapāsā vā na vijahitabbaṁ_, “Or one is not to go beyond arm’s reach from that very public meeting hall or that gateway.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.4.2": "Sp 1.480: _Hatthapāsā vāti gabbhassa hatthapāsā_, “_Hatthapāsā vā_: arm’s reach of the room.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.4.3": "“The main entrance” renders _dvāramūle_. Sp 1.480: _Sabbesaṁ sādhāraṇe gharadvāramūle_, “At the base of that door of the house which is common to all.” And then: _Hatthapāsā vāti gabbhassa vā gharadvāramūlassa vā hatthapāsā_, “_Hatthapāsā vā_: arm’s reach of the room or the main entrance.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.7.1": "The building at [pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.7.1](), the _māḷa_, is hard to distinguish from the next two buildings, the _pāsāda_ and the _hammiya_. In fact, according to Sp 1.482 they are all different kinds of _pāsāda_, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses”: _Māḷoti ekakūṭasaṅgahito caturassapāsādo. Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti muṇḍacchadanapāsādo_, “A _māḷa_ is a square stilt house with (a roof in) a single peak. A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is a stilt house with a bald roof.” Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful for practical purposes, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. For practical purposes, what these three buildings have in common—and this is what distinguishes them from the buildings at [pli-tv-bu-vb-np2:3.4.1]()–3.5.4, the _nivesana_ and the _uddosita_—is that they do not have an enclosed category.
