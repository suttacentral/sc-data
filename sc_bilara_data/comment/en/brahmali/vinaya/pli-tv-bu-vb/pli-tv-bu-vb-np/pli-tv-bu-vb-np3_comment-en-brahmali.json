So punapi tathā karoti_, “In regard to this _ussāpetvā punappunaṃ vimajjati_ means: thinking, ʻWhen the wrinkles disappear, it will be larger,ʼ he would sprinkle it with water, step on it with his feet, and then lifting and holding it up with his hands, he would rub it against his back. But when dried in the sun, it returned to its initial size. He would then do it again.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:1.3.13.1": "_Cīvara_ means both a finished robe and any cloth that can be used to make a robe. I vary my translation depending on the context. [See essay on _cīvara_.] ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:2.1.2": "This refers to robe-cloth received during the robe season. For details see [Kd 7:1.7.4-pli-tv-kd7:12.1.37](pli-tv-kd7:1.7.4-pli-tv-kd7:12.1.37). ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:2.1.6": "That is, in-season robe-cloth is cloth obtained during the last month of the rainy season, while out-of-season robe-cloth is cloth obtained during the remaining eleven months of the year. [pli-tv-bu-vb-np28:2.9](): _Cīvarakālasamayo nāma anatthate kathine vassānassa pacchimo māso_, “_Cīvarakālasamaya_: for one who has not participated in the robe-making ceremony, it is the last month of the rainy season.” Kkh: _Akālacīvaraṃ nāma yvāyaṃ “anatthate kathine vassānassa pacchimo māso … ”ti cīvarakālo vutto, taṃ ṭhapetvā aññadā uppannaṃ … etaṃ akālacīvaraṃ nāma_, “_Akālacīvara_: when the robe-making ceremony has not been performed, then the last month of the rainy season … is called the robe season.

[See essay on _kathina_ for a further explanation of this.] ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:2.1.8": "Sp.1.499: _Kālepi ādissa dinnanti saṅghassa vā “idaṁ akālacīvaran”ti uddisitvā dinnaṁ, ekapuggalassa vā “idaṁ tuyhaṁ dammī”ti dinnaṁ_, “ʻAlso, if it is given in the robe seasonʼ: it is given to the Sangha after designating it by saying, ‘This is out-of-season robe-cloth,’ or it is given to an individual by saying, ‘I give this to you.’” In other words, “designated” means designated as out-of-season cloth or designated to an individual. Sp.2.740, commenting on _bhikkhunī nissaggiya pācittiya_ 2, adds that designating to a group is included in designated cloth: _Ādissa dinnanti sampattā bhājentūti vatvāpi idaṁ gaṇassa idaṁ tumhākaṁ dammīti vatvā vā dātukamyatāya pādamūle ṭhapetvā vā dinnampi ādissa dinnaṁ nāma hoti; etaṁ sabbampi akālacīvaraṁ_, “‘Given after designating’: also if they give after saying, ‘Let those who are present share it out,’ or after saying, ‘I give this to the group, to you,’ or they place it at the feet (of the recipient) wishing to give, this is called ‘given after designating’.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:2.2.3": "The Pali idiom is such that _dvīhuppanne_, literally, “given two days ago”, actually means given on the day after he received the original piece of cloth. The way this works, it seems, is that the day on which the cloth was received counts as one. I do the equivalent adjustment for each case below. See also the definition of ten days in _bhikkhu nissaggiya pācittiya_ 1, where the eleventh dawn means the tenth dawn after one received the cloth. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np3:2.2.31": "Again, in the Pali idiom, _tiṁse uppanne_, literally, “given thirty days ago”, actually means given twenty-nine days ago. ",
