  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np1:2.1.1": "“Was offered” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i>. This word, which literally means “arisen”, varies slightly in meaning dependent on the context. Often it refers to a requisite that has just been given to the Sangha or an individual monastic. I then render <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i> as “given”. Occasionally however, such as here, this does not fit the context, because Ānanda would have incurred a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nissaggiya pācittiya</i> offense had he received the robe. In other words, here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i> happens first, and only afterwards is the robe given. The meaning, then, must be that Ānanda had been given an offer or a promise of a robe, but had not yet received it. In this sense the robe had “become available” to him. The most common way for a requisite to become available to a monastic is that an offer is made. I translate accordingly. See also DOP for this meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppanna</i>. ",
