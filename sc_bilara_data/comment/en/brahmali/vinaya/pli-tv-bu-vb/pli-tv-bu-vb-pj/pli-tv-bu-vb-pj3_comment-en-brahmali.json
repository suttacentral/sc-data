  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:1.3.9": "I have here translated _kāya_ as breath in accordance with the usage in the Ānāpānasati Sutta ([mn118:24.6]()) where the breath is specifically said to be a body among bodies. Sp 1.165: _Sakalassa assāsakāyassa ādimajjhapariyosānaṁ viditaṁ karonto pākaṭaṁ karonto “assasissāmī”ti sikkhati_, “He trains, ‘I will breathe in’, producing knowledge of and familiarity with the beginning, the middle, and the end of the whole body of the breath.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:2.49.1": "“An instrument of death” renders _satthahāraka_. I follow Richard Gombrich’s interpretation of this word. See “The Mass Suicide of Monks in Discourse and Vinaya Literature”, by Analayo, Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies, 7: 11–55, 2014. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:4.5.3": "Sp 1.176: _Yaṁ uddissa khanati, tassa dukkhuppattiyā thullaccayaṁ, maraṇena pārājikaṁ. Aññasmiṁ patitvā mate anāpatti_, “If the person he dug the pit for experiences pain, there is a serious offense. If he dies, there is an offense entailing expulsion. If someone else falls in and dies, there is no offense.” The commentary makes a point that goes beyond what is found in the Canonical text. According to the Canonical text, if you dig a pit for any human being to fall into, then the offense occurs when any human being falls into it. The commentary, however, makes the additional point that if you dig a pit for a specific human to fall into, you only commit an offence if that same human being falls into it. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:4.5.5": "Sp 1.176: _Sace anuddissa “yo koci marissatī”ti khato hoti, yattakā patitvā maranti, tattakā pāṇātipātā_, “If it is not dug for a specific person or being, but with the thought, ‘Whatever dies’, then, to the extent that a being falls in and dies, there is killing.” And therefore an offense entailing expulsion if that being is human. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:4.5.9": "Kkh-pt: _Manussaviggaho nāgasupaṇṇādisadiso tiracchānagato tiracchānagatamanussaviggaho_, “_Tiracchānagatamanussaviggaha_: an animal like a dragon or a _garuda_, etc., in human form.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.3.8": "Sp-t 1.180: _Udukkhalabhaṇḍikanti udukkhalatthāya ānītaṁ dārubhaṇḍaṁ_, “_Udukkhalabhaṇḍika_: wooden goods brought for the sake of a mortar.” That _akkamati_ can mean “kick” can be seen from [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:10.20.9](): _Aññatarā itthī passitvā aṅgajāte abhinisīdi_, “The monk kicked her off.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.4.2": "“For a certain event” is not found in the Pali, but has been added to make the Pali idiom clearer. Sp 2.108: _Kāle ārociteti yāgubhattādīsu yassa kassaci kāle ārocite_, “_Kāle ārocite_: when the time is announced for whatever, such as rice porridge, a meal, etc.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.13.1": "The Pali seem to say that he simply fell off the cliff, _papatanto_, but the context seems to require something more deliberate. Perhaps it is just an idiom. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.18.22": "It is not an offense entailing expulsion because he was aiming to kill the child, not the mother. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.23.1": "The text doesn’t say what the legal procedure, the _(saṅgha-)kamma_, was about, but it seems implied that it was against that monk. This is also the position of the sub-commentary at Sp-t 2.187: _Kammādhippāyāti: tajjanīyādikammakaraṇādhippāyā_, “Aiming at a legal procedure: aiming at doing a legal procedure of censure, etc.” The monks from the group of seventeen were in regular conflict with the monks from the group of six.
