Other contexts show that the _santhāgāra_ was used for a number of purposes. At [MN 51:10.3](mn51:10.3) it is used as a place to perform a ritual; from [MN 53:2.1](mn53:2.1) and similar contexts we can deduce from the word _anajjhāvuṭṭha_, “not (previously) lived in”, that it was used as a place of lodging; at [DN 3:1.13.4](dn3:1.13.4) the Sakyans were enjoying themselves in their _santhāgāra_; according to [DN 16:5.20.1](dn16:5.20.1) and other _suttas_, the official meetings were held there; and at [SN 56.45:1.3](sn56.45:1.3) the Licchavī were practicing archery in the _santhāgāra_.

  "pli-tv-kd6:31.2.1": "Bhikkhu Sujāto has this to say about the name Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta: “(The Ñātika clan) were perhaps the second-most important of the clans that made up the Vajjian League (after the Licchavīs), yet there is little information about them, and they seem almost absent from the Pali texts. One of the rather noteworthy aspects of the clan is how variable the spelling of their name is. We find Jṇātṛika or Jṇātaka in Sanskrit; Ñātaka in Pali, Nāyika in Jain Prakrit, and well as Nāṭaka, and so on. The variety of forms and dialectical variations is forbidding, but it appears that the sense of the word is simply “the clan”, i.e. it is ñāti as in “family”. By far the most famous member of the clan was Mahāvīra, the leader of the Jains. In Pali, he is known as Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. The later name is explained by the commentary as “son of a dancer”; it is also sometimes spelled Nāthaputta (son of a lord). However given the universal Jain tradition that he was a Jṇātṛika, it seems certain that this is a misunderstanding, and that Nāṭaputta in fact means “a son of the Jṇātṛi clan”, i.e. a Jṇātṛika. It is the same pattern as Sākyaputta, which means “Sakyan”. Given this, perhaps we should reconsider how we present his name. Nigaṇṭha means “knotless”, but it is just a term for a Jain ascetic (as bhikkhu is for Buddhists). Perhaps we should translate his name as “the Jain monk of the Ñātika clan.” See full discussion here: https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-lost-vajjian-clan-of-the-natikas/28048. ",
