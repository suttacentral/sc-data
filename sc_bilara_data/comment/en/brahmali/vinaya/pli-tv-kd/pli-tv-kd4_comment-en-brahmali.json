Sp.1.16: _Setu vuccati maggo, maggeneva tādisassa vacanassa ghāto, samucchedoti vuttaṁ hoti_, “The path is called the bridge; such speech is destroyed by the path.” The commentary seems to take _setu_, “bridge”, as a reference to the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access. ",

  "pli-tv-kd4:16.16.1": "_Ce_, \"if\", does not fit in the current context, since there is no main clause corresponding to the conditional clause. Perhaps this is an ancient mistake, whereby the _ce_ has been added on the pattern of the similar phrases above. I translate as if the _ce_ is not there. ",
