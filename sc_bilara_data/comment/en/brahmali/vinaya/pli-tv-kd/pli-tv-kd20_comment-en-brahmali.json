Although I have rendered _paṇḍaka_ as “eunuch”, it does not seem right to translate _itthipaṇḍaka_ as “female eunuch”, which is largely meaningless, especially so in an ancient Indian context. It seems the idea of a _paṇḍaka_ expanded over time and that the _itthipaṇḍaka_ may refer to this expanded category, see [this article](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-meaning-of-pa-aka-in-light-of-the-vedic-and-jain-scriptures/12894). According to Sp.1.285: _Itthipaṇḍakāti animittāva vuccati_, “It is just a woman without genitals who is called an _itthipaṇḍakā_.” This seems strange since in the ordination procedure a woman is asked both whether she is an _itthipaṇḍaka_ and whether she is _animitta_. If they mean the same thing, then we have a redundancy. Perhaps the two words are close in meaning, but not identical, and thus the apparent redundancy. Given the commentarial explanation, I have opted to translate _itthipaṇḍaka_ as “a woman without sexual characteristics”. | _Vepurisikā_. Sp.1.285: _Vepurisikāti samassudāṭhikā purisarūpā itthī_, “_Vepurisikā_ means a woman who has a beard and a mustache like a man.” | _Sambhinnā_. Sp.1.285: _Sambhinnāti sambhinnavaccamaggapassāvamaggā_, “_Sambhinnā_ means the anus and the vagina are joined.” That _passāvamagga_, “the path of urine”, can refer to the vagina is clear from _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1 at [Bu Pj 1:9.1.10](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.1.10) where it refers to an orifice for sexual intercourse. Also, it is anatomically more likely that the anus and vagina would be conjoined, rather than the anus and the urethra. ",

  "pli-tv-kd20:17.4.11": "The Pali reads: _Ayaṁ itthannāmā itthannāmāya ayyāya upasampadāpekkhā_. Taking the genitive case here to be the agent genitive, which seems to be the most obvious reading, this would mean, “So-and-so who is seeking to be fully ordained *by* Venerable so-and-so.” But it is the Sangha that ordains, not individuals, and so this translation does not seem quite right. According to Vmv.3.126 this phrase should be understood by means of this example: _Ayaṁ buddharakkhito āyasmato dhammarakkhitassa saddhivihārikabhūto upasampadāpekkho_, “This Buddharakkhita, who is seeking the full ordination, is the student of Venerable Dhammarakkhita.” I have followed this interpretation, and thus my translation “with Venerable so-and-so”.

What time did you have? What date did you have?’ you should reply, ‘I had this: it was the rainy season/the cold season/the hot season; I had this time; I had this date.’” The point seems to be that a newly ordained nun should remember the time and date of her ordination so that she may respond to questions about it in future. Vmv.3.128 clarifies: _Chāyādikameva sabbaṁ saṅgahetvā gāyitabbato kathetabbato saṅgītīti āha “idamevā”tiādi. Tattha ekato katvā ācikkhitabbaṁ.

  "pli-tv-kd20:19.1.4": "_Yā na pavāreyya, yathādhammo kāretabbo_. Curiously, the _yā_ does not agree with _kāretabbo_.
