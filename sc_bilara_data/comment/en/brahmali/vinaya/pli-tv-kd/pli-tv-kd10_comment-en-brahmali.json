  "pli-tv-kd10:2.6.7": "_Viññutaṁ pāpuṇi_, literally, “reached discernment”. Commenting on a similar context at [Kd 20:26.1.6](pli-tv-kd20:25.1.6), [Sp.4.432]() explains: _Yāva so dārako viññutaṁ pāpuṇātīti yāva khādituṁ bhuñjituṁ nahāyituñca maṇḍituñca attano dhammatāya sakkotīti attho_, “_Yāva so dārako viññutaṁ pāpuṇāti_ means until he is able to eat, bathe, and groom himself.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd10:3.1.6": "Literally, “They do not think there is something more.” [Sp.3.464](): _Nāññaṃ bhiyyo amaññarunti koci ekopi “ahaṃ bālo”ti ca na maññittha; bhiyyo ca saṅghasmiṃ bhijjamāne aññampi ekaṃ “mayhaṃ kāraṇā saṅgho bhijjatī”ti idaṃ kāraṇaṃ na maññitthāti attho_, “The meaning of _nāññaṃ bhiyyo amaññarun_ is: not even one thinks, ‘I am a fool.’ And more, when the Sangha is being split, not even one other thinks of this action that, ‘The Sangha is being split because of me.’” ",

  "pli-tv-kd10:4.5.5": "_Harita_ could in principle refer to all plants, but it is elsewhere defined as what is cultivated, see [Bu Pc 19:2.1.14](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc19:2.1.14) and [Bi Pc 9:2.1.14](pli-tv-bi-vb-pc9:2.1.14). ",
  "pli-tv-kd10:4.5.7": "“Dining hall” renders _bhattagga_, literally, “a eating house”. The name suggests that the _bhattagga_ was a separate building for eating. They were found both in private houses and in monasteries, as can be seen from the present passage. Since they were part of houses, “refectory” is not a satisfactory rendering. The fact that kitchens are not mentioned separately may mean that they were part of the _bhattagga_, except in monasteries. This is supported by a passage at [Bu Pj 3:5.3.1](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.3.1) that mentions a cooking implement, a pestle, being stored in a _bhattagga_. ",

In the same way, the thirty-seven aids to awakening—the four focuses of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four bases for spiritual power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven factors of awakening, the noble eightfold path—are in accordance with the Teaching; while the three focuses of mindfulness, the three right efforts, the three bases for spiritual power, the six faculties, the six powers, the eight factors of awakening, the noble ninefold path, as well as the four graspings, the five hindrances, the seven underlying tendencies, and the eight kinds of wrongness are all contrary to the Teaching.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd10:5.10.9": "The point seems to be that if the incoming monks, at least one of whom now belong to a different Buddhist sect, are to stay in the same place as the other monks, then they must be given dwellings according to seniority. If, however, they are staying in a separate location, then seniority only counts within that location. [Vmv.3.473](): _Vivittaṃ katvāpi dātabbanti vuttattā pana yathāvuḍḍhaṃ varasenāsanaṃ adatvā vuḍḍhānampi asaññatānaṃ saññatehi vivittaṃ katvā dātabbanti daṭṭhabbaṃ_, “Because of what has been said, ‘Create separate resting places and then give them out’ is to be understood like this: not having given the best dwellings according to seniority, (the dwellings) are to be given out after separating the unrestrained senior monastics from the restrained ones.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd10:5.13.2": "A literal translation of the Pali might read as follows: “In regard to which reason there was quarrel, argument, conflict, dispute, schism, fracture, division, and separation in the Sangha, this monk has committed, and has been ejected, and he has seen, and he has been reinstated.” I understand this to mean that the basis for the conflict has been dealt with.
