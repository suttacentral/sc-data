  "pli-tv-kd2:2.1.9": "The Pali has ellipses points at the end of this sentence. This seems to be a mistake. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:3.4.2": "This definition is play on the two unrelated words _mukha_ and _mokkha_, respectively meaning “front” and “freedom”. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:7.1.6": "“Across” is not in the Canonical text, but is supplied from the commentary. Sp.3.140: _Tiyojanaparamanti ettha tiyojanaṃ paramaṃ pamāṇametissāti tiyojanaparamā; taṃ tiyojanaparamaṃ. Sammannantena pana majjhe ṭhatvā yathā catūsupi disāsu diyaḍḍhadiyaḍḍhayojanaṃ hoti, evaṃ sammannitabbā. Sace pana majjhe ṭhatvā ekekadisato tiyojanaṃ karonti, chayojanaṃ hotīti na vaṭṭati.

Sace hi yena kenaci pariyantena kesaggamattampi tiyojanaṃ atikkāmeti, āpattiñca āpajjati sīmā ca asīmā hoti_; “40 kilometers at the most: here 40 kilometers at the most is its measure. This is 40 kilometers at the most. One who is establishing [a monastery zone], standing in the middle, should establish [a zone] that is 20 kilometers in the four directions. If, standing in the middle, he makes it 40 kilometers in each direction, it will be 80 kilometers, which is not allowable. One who is establishing [a zone] that is quadrangular or triangular should establish [a zone] that is 40 kilometers corner to corner. If he exceeds the 40 kilometers even by a hair’s breadth on any side, he commits an offence, and the zone is not actually a monastery zone.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:7.1.8": "The Pali for 50, 65, 80, and 40 kilometers is 4, 5, 6, and 3 _yojanas_ respectively. [See essay on Measures.] ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:8.1.1": "The point seems to be that they recited the _pātimokkha_ in a different place every lunar half-month. Sp.3.141: _Anupariveṇiyanti ekasīmamahāvihāre tasmiṁ tasmiṁ pariveṇe_, “‘In one precincts after another’: in this or that precincts within a large monastery inside a single monastery zone.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7": "Apart from the _vihāra_, “a dwelling”, and the _guha_, “a cave”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Sp.4.294: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” Sp-ṭ.3.4.294 clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” Sp.4.294 continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ.3.3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished only according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:9.2.1": "“Forecourt” renders _pamukha_. Sp-ṭ.3.142: _Uposathappamukhaṃ nāma uposathāgārassa sammukhaṭṭhānaṃ_, “The place which is face-to-face with the observance-day hall is called _uposathappamukhaṃ_.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:12.7.2": "That is, seven _abbhantaras_. [See essay on Measures.] ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:15.3.1": "Sp.3.150: _Savarabhayanti aṭavimanussabhayaṃ_, “_Savarabhayaṃ_: threat from forest people.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:18.4.4": "“By name” renders the obscure compound _nāmaggena_. The commentaries are silent. Alternative readings include _nāmamattena_, _gaṇamaggena_, and _nasamaggena_, none of which is an obvious fit for the current context. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:21.2.4": "[See essay on _mattika_ and _cuṇṇa_.] ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:24.3.4": "“Enemies of monks” is a translation of _bhikkhupaccatthikā_. At _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1, I have translated the same compound as “enemy monks”. At _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1 this seems required because various people who are acting as enemies of monks are mentioned separately, such as kings, bandits, and scoundrels. Moreover, all of these are compounded with _paccatthikā_: _bhikkhupaccatthikā_, _rājapaccatthikā_, and so on. Since it seems reasonable to assume that all these compounds have the same structure, it follows that they should all be read as “enemies who are so-and-so” rather than “enemies of so-and-so”. This understanding is confirmed by Sp.1.58: _bhikkhū eva paccatthikā bhikkhupaccatthikā_, “_Bhikkhupaccatthikā_ are just monks who are enemies.” In the present context, however, this interpretation does not seem to work. If _bhikkhupaccatthikā_ refers to enemies who are monks, then they would have to be invited to take part in the ceremony, or some other arrangement would have to be made, but nothing is said about this in either the Pali or the commentaries. Moreover, kings, bandits, and scoundrels are in this case not compounded with _paccatthikā_, as they are in _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1. I therefore conclude that the meaning here must be “enemies of monks”. ",

  "pli-tv-kd2:28.1.3": "Here “resident monk” means a monk who is within the _sīmā_, the monastery zone. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:28.5.5": "_Avuṭṭhitāya parisāya_ literally means that “the gathering has not got up”. The point, presumably, is that the meeting is not yet over and those present have not started to leave. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:36.4.1": "“A passed-on purity that has expired”, _pārivāsikapārisuddhidānena_, seems to refer to purity that was conveyed for a different occasion. So long as the assembly is still seated, the occasion is regarded as the same. See _bhikkhunī-pācittiya_ 81 for a more detailed explanation. "
