  "pli-tv-kd2:3.4.2": "This definition is a play on the two unrelated words _mukha_ and _mokkha_, respectively meaning “front” and “freedom”. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:3.6.10": "The phrasing here is a bit curious, but according to the commentary at Sp 3.135 it is to be understood as the opposite of segment [pli-tv-kd2:3.5.6]() above. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:3.7.3": "Sp 3.135: _Dukkaṭaṁ hotīti dukkaṭāpatti hoti; sā ca kho na musāvādalakkhaṇena; bhagavato pana vacanena vacīdvāre akiriyasamuṭṭhānā āpatti hotīti veditabbā_, “‘There is an act of wrong conduct’: there is an offense of wrong conduct. It does not have the characteristics of lying. But according to the statement by the Buddha, it is to be understood that there is an offense originating through non-action at the speech door.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:7.1.6": "“Across” is not in the Canonical text, but is supplied from the commentary. Sp 3.140: _Tiyojanaparamanti ettha tiyojanaṁ paramaṁ pamāṇametissāti tiyojanaparamā; taṁ tiyojanaparamaṁ. Sammannantena pana majjhe ṭhatvā yathā catūsupi disāsu diyaḍḍhadiyaḍḍhayojanaṁ hoti, evaṁ sammannitabbā. Sace pana majjhe ṭhatvā ekekadisato tiyojanaṁ karonti, chayojanaṁ hotīti na vaṭṭati.

Sace hi yena kenaci pariyantena kesaggamattampi tiyojanaṁ atikkāmeti, āpattiñca āpajjati sīmā ca asīmā hoti_; “40 kilometers at the most: here 40 kilometers at the most is its measure. This is 40 kilometers at the most. One who is establishing (a monastery zone), standing in the middle, should establish (a zone) that is 20 kilometers in the four directions. If, standing in the middle, he makes it 40 kilometers in each direction, it will be 80 kilometers, which is not allowable. One who is establishing (a zone) that is quadrangular or triangular should establish (a zone) that is 40 kilometers corner to corner. If he exceeds the 40 kilometers even by a hair’s breadth on any side, he commits an offence, and the zone is not actually a monastery zone.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:7.1.8": "The Pali for 50, 65, 80, and 40 kilometers is 4, 5, 6, and 3 _yojanas_ respectively. For a discussion of the _yojana_, see Measures in the Appendix of Technical Terms. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:8.1.1": "The point seems to be that they recited the _pātimokkha_ in a different place every lunar half-month. Sp 3.141: _Anupariveṇiyanti ekasīmamahāvihāre tasmiṁ tasmiṁ pariveṇe_, “‘In one yard after another’: in this or that yard within a large monastery inside a single monastery zone.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7": "Apart from the _vihāra_, “a dwelling”, and the _guha_, “a cave”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Rather than try to differentiate between between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Sp 4.294: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” Sp-t 3.4.294 clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” Sp 4.294 continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ is just a _pāsāda_ that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.” At Sp-t 3.3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished only according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:9.2.1": "“Forecourt” renders _pamukha_. Sp-t 3.142: _Uposathappamukhaṁ nāma uposathāgārassa sammukhaṭṭhānaṁ_, “The place which is face-to-face with the observance-day hall is called _uposathappamukhaṁ_.” ",

  "pli-tv-kd2:18.4.4": "“By name” renders the obscure compound _nāmaggena_. The commentaries are silent. Alternative readings include _nāmamattena_, _gaṇamaggena_, and _nasamaggena_, none of which is an obvious fit for the current context. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:21.2.3": "_Mātikā_, “Key Terms”, probably refers to the two Pātimokkhas. Sp 5.325: _Pātimokkhanti dve mātikā na jānāti_, “_Pātimokkha_: he does not know the two (collections of) key terms.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:21.2.4": "For an explanation of rendering _cuṇṇa_ and _mattika_ as respectively “bath powder” and “soap”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. ",

  "pli-tv-kd2:24.3.4": "“Enemies of monks” is a translation of _bhikkhupaccatthikā_. At [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.3.1](), I have translated the same compound as “enemy monks”. In that rule this seems required because various people who are acting as enemies of monks are mentioned separately, such as kings, bandits, and scoundrels. Moreover, all of these are compounded with _paccatthikā_: _bhikkhupaccatthikā_, _rājapaccatthikā_, and so on. Since it seems reasonable to assume that all these compounds have the same structure, it follows that they should all be read as “enemies who are so-and-so” rather than “enemies of so-and-so”. This understanding is confirmed by Sp 1.58: _bhikkhū eva paccatthikā bhikkhupaccatthikā_, “_Bhikkhupaccatthikā_ are just monks who are enemies.” In the present context, however, this interpretation does not seem to work. If _bhikkhupaccatthikā_ refers to enemies who are monks, then they would have to be invited to take part in the ceremony, or some other arrangement would have to be made, but nothing is said about this in either the Pali or the commentaries. Moreover, kings, bandits, and scoundrels are in this case not compounded with _paccatthikā_, as they are in Bu Pj 1. I therefore conclude that the meaning here must be “enemies of monks”. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:26.3.6": "_Therena bhikkhunā_ could be rendered “a/the senior monk”. Yet the point is that only the most senior member of the Sangha should use the semi-informal address _āvuso_, whereas everyone else should use the formal equivalent _bhante_. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:26.4.1": "_Navakena bhikkhunā_ could be rendered “a/the junior monk”. Yet the point here is that only the most senior member of the Sangha should use the semi-informal address _āvuso_, whereas everyone else should use the formal equivalent _bhante_. In this context, then, _navaka_ does not mean a “newly ordained” monk, but rather refers to any monk junior to the most senior one. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:28.1.3": "Here “resident monk” means a monk who is within the _sīmā_, the monastery zone. Vjb 3.172: _Sīmaṁ okkante vā okkamante vā passanti_, “They someone entering or having entered the monastic zone.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:28.5.5": "_Avuṭṭhitāya parisāya_ literally means that “the gathering has not got up”. The point, presumably, is that the meeting is not yet over and those present have not started to leave. ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:35.1.2": "Here and below I understand a monastery, an _āvāsa_, to refer to a monastery with a properly defined zone, a _sīmā_. A non-monastery, an _anāvāsa_, is then a monastic residence without such a zone.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd2:36.4.1": "“A passed-on purity that has expired”, _pārivāsikapārisuddhidānena_, seems to refer to purity that was conveyed for a different occasion. So long as the assembly is still seated, the occasion is regarded as the same. See [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc81:1.13.1]() for a more detailed explanation. "
