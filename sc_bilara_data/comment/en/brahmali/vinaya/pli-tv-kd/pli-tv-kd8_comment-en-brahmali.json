  "pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3": "Apart from the _vihāra_, “a dwelling”, and the _guha_, “a cave”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the _aḍḍhayoga_, the _pāsāda_, and the _hammiya_, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of _pāsāda_, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say. Sp.4.294: _Aḍḍhayogoti supaṇṇavaṅkagehaṁ_, “An _aḍḍhayoga_ is a house bent like a _supaṇṇa_.” Sp-ṭ.3.4.294 clarifies: _Supaṇṇavaṅkagehanti garuḷapakkhasaṇṭhānena katagehaṁ_, “_Supaṇṇavaṅkageha_: a house made in the shape of the wings of a _garula_ (=_garuda_).” Sp.4.294 continues: _Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva_, “A _pāsāda_ is a long stilt house. A _hammiya_ just a _pāsāda_ that has a house with a peak established on top of the flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ.3.3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:8.1.3": "_Guttāgutta_. Sp.3.343: _Guttāguttañca jāneyyāti ettha yassa tāva chadanādīsu koci doso natthi, taṁ guttaṁ_, “_Guttāguttañca jāneyya_: here, in so far as there is no fault in the roofing, etc. it is protected.” The commentary then goes on to say he should make repairs if the stored goods are unprotected. ",
  "pli-tv-kd8:9.1.3": "The Pali uses the instrumental case, _saṅghena_, which seems to suggest that the robe-cloth is to be distributed _by_ the Sangha. Yet the ensuing uproar suggests that the Sangha was not in charge, which is why the Buddha gives the allowance to appoint a distributor of robe-cloth. So it might seem that _saṅghena_ here indicates the recipient of the robe-cloth. Further on in this chapter we see a similar syntax with the verb _bhājeti_, with the instrumental appearing to indicate the recipient rather than the distributor (e.g. at [Kd 8:32.1.8](pli-tv-kd8:32.1.8) and [Kd 8:32.1.10](pli-tv-kd8:32.1.10)). This usage can perhaps best be understood as a case of “sharing _with_” rather than “distributing _to_”. ",

If not, then what has the value of nine or eight should be bound with another (piece) that has the value of one or two, in this way fixing equal shares’. _Bhikkhū gaṇetvā vaggaṁ bandhitvā_: the meaning is: ‘I allow, if one day is not sufficient to give it out to each one separately, to count the monks in groups of ten, then to bind ten shares of robe-cloth for each group, then to make one bundle, and in this way to fix the shares of robe-cloth.’” ",

  "pli-tv-kd8:9.4.4": "The meaning of this is not clear. _Toseti_, which is the causative formation of _tussati_, means “to please” or “to satisfy” someone. Judging from the usage of this verb elsewhere, it seems to be exclusively used with reference to living beings, that is, the patient of the verb will invariably be a living being. Reading _vikalake_ as an accusative plural, the meaning of _vikalake tosetvā_ might be construed as follows: “to satisfy those who are short (of robes or cloth)”. The meaning of _kusapātaṁ kātuṁ_, literally, “the _kusa_-grass should be dropped”, is equally unclear. Yet according to how _kusa_-grass is used elsewhere as an aid to distributing requisites (e.g. at Mv.2.164), I take it to refer to a randomized method for giving out shares of robe-cloth. I translate accordingly. I have added the word “remainder” to clarify the overall meaning. The commentary, however, sees most of this differently. Sp.3.343: _Vikalake tosetvāti … Cīvaravikalakaṁ nāma sabbesaṁ pañca pañca vatthāni pattāni, sesānipi atthi, ekekaṁ pana na pāpuṇāti, chinditvā dātabbāni. … Chinditvā dinne pana taṁ tositaṁ hoti, atha kusapāto kātabbo_, “_Vikalake tosetvā_: … _Cīvaravikalaka_ means when five cloths are obtained by everyone and there are leftovers, but not sufficient for each one, the cloth should be cut up and then given out. … When it is given out after cutting it up, that means the remainder is shared out. Then the _kusa_-grass should be dropped.” ",

For when it is done in this way, the dye does not overflow.” Sp-ṭ.3.3.344 specifies that the collar goes inside the pot, _antorajanakumbhiyā_. Vmv.3.344 adds: _Evañhi kateti vaṭṭādhārassa anto rajanodakaṁ, bahi challikañca katvā viyojane kate.
