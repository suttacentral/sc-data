They refer to enormous fish of different sizes. The creatures mentioned, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attabhāvā</i>—which presumably include the sea monsters—have huge bodies, respectively 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yojanas</i> long. I normally take a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yojana</i> to be approximately 13 kilometers, but here use 10 kilometers instead, so as to give round figures. See discussion of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yojana</i> under Measures in the Appendix of Technical Terms. ",

  "pli-tv-kd19:3.3.83": "The point seems to be that it is illegitimate to cancel the Monastic Code of someone who is behaving appropriately, including taking part in legal procedures in the appropriate manner and not reopening legitimate legal procedures. See discussion in the next note. ",

Iccassāpi sāpattikasseva pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapitaṁ hoti</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ na upeti</i> means, when a legal procedure is being carried out by the Sangha, one who wishes to invalidate the procedure does not come (to the meeting), or does not give their consent, or objects in the presence (of the assembled Sangha). They commit wrong conduct. Thus, because they have an offense, the Monastic Code gets canceled.” Vmv 4.387 adds: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dhammikaṁ sāmagginti dhammikaṁ samaggakammaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ</i> means a legitimate legal procedure of a complete assembly.” The point is that the person wants to invalidate a legal procedure, and so deliberately does not come to the meeting or send their consent. In such a case you are allowed to cancel their hearing of the Monastic Code.
