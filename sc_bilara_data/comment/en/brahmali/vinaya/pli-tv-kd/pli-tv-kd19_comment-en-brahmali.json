Respectively 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 _yojanas_ long. I normally take a _yojana_ to be approximately 13 kilometers, but here use 10 kilometers instead, so as to give round figures.

  "pli-tv-kd19:3.3.38": "_Amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapeti akatāya_. Sp.4.387: _Amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapeti akatāyāti tena puggalena sā vipatti katā vā hotu akatā vā, pātimokkhaṭṭhapanakassa saññāamūlikavasena amūlikā hoti_, “_Amūlikāya sīlavipattiyā pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapeti akatāya_ means, whether that person has failed or not, it is groundless because of the perception of groundlessness of the person who has canceled the Monastic Code.” ",

  "pli-tv-kd19:3.3.89": "_Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ na upeti_. Sp.4.387: _Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ na upetīti kammaṁ kopetukāmatāya saṅghassa kamme karīyamāne neva āgacchati, na chandaṁ deti, sammukhībhūtova paṭikkosati, tena dukkaṭaṁ āpajjati. Iccassāpi sāpattikasseva pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapitaṁ hoti_, “_Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ na upeti_ means, when a legal procedure is being carried out by the Sangha, one who wishes to invalidate the procedure does not come (to the meeting), or does not give his consent, or objects in the presence (of the assembled Sangha). He commits wrong conduct. Thus, for him who has an offense, the Monastic Code is canceled.” Vmv.4.387 adds: _Dhammikaṁ sāmagginti dhammikaṁ samaggakammaṁ_, “_Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ_ means a legitimate legal procedure of a complete assembly.” The point is that the person wants to invalidate a legal procedure, and so deliberately does not come to the meeting or send their consent. In such a case you are allowed to cancel their hearing of the Monastic Code. | _Dhammikaṁ sāmaggiṁ paccādiyati_. Sp.4.387: _Paccādiyatīti “puna kātabbaṁ kamma”nti paccādiyati, tena ukkoṭanakena pācittiyaṁ āpajjati. Iccassāpi sāpattikasseva pātimokkhaṁ ṭhapitaṁ hoti_, “_Paccādiyati_ means saying, ‘The legal procedure needs to be redone.’ Because of that reopening, he commits an offense entailing confession. Thus, for him who has an offense, the Monastic Code is canceled.” ",
