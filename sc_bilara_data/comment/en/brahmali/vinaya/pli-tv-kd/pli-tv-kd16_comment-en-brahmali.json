Apart from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vihāra</i>, “dwellings”, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>guha</i>, “caves”, the Pali mentions three kinds of buildings, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhayoga</i>, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i>, all of which, according to the commentaries are different kinds of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, “stilt houses”. Rather than try to differentiate between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt houses”.
