  "pli-tv-kd13:1.1.1": "“The chapter containing the collection of processes for the clearing of offenses entailing suspension” is a cumbersome rendering of the chapter heading _Samuccayakkhandhaka_. _Samuccaya_ literally means “collection”. According to the subcommentary this refers to the collection of the various processes for making amends for _saṅghādisesa_ offenses (Vmv.4.134): _Saṅghādisesānaṁ parivāsadānādisabbavinicchayassa samuccayattā panesa samuccayakkhandhakoti vuttoti veditabbo_, “It is to be understood that because of the collection of all the explanations of the giving of probation, etc., for offenses entailing suspension, it is said ‘_samuccayakkhandhaka_’.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd13:23.5.2": "In _jānappaṭicchannā_ I understand _jāna_ as an adjective qualifying _paṭicchannā_, in other words, that he knows about the concealing. It could perhaps also be understood that the knowing refers to the offense, but this seems less likely given the close, compounded connection between _jāna_ and _jānappaṭicchannā_. ",
  "pli-tv-kd13:28.1.1": "“Specified” renders _parimāṇā_, lit. “limited”. Sp.4.165: _Tattha “antarā sambahulā āpattiyo āpajjati parimāṇā appaṭicchannāyo”tiādīsu āpattiparicchedavasena parimāṇāyo ceva appaṭicchannāyo cāti attho_, “Here the meaning of _antarā sambahulā āpattiyo āpajjati parimāṇā appaṭicchannāyo_, etc. is that it is specified and unconcealed on account of the offense being delimited.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd13:33.1.8": "“Of the same sort” renders _vavatthitā_, while “of various sorts” renders _sambhinnā_. Sp.4.180: _Vavatthitā sambhinnāti sabhāgavisabhāgānamevetaṁ pariyāyavacanaṁ_, “‘Of the same sort’ and ‘of various sorts’ are synonymous with ‘of one kind’ and ‘of different kinds’.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd13:34.1.12": "_Missakadiṭṭhino_, lit. “They see (it) as mixed.” Sp.4.181: _Tattha missakanti thullaccayādīhi missakaṁ_, “Therein ‘mixed’ means mixed with serious offenses, etc.” "
