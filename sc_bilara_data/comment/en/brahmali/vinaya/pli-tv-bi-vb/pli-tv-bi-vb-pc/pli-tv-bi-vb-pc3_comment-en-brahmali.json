  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc3:1.14.1": "“Slaps her genitals with the palm of her hand” renders _talaghātaka_, literally, “Hits with the palm.” It seems from the origin story, however, that this was an indirect expression referring to the genitals. Sp 2.803 supports this interpretation: _Talaghātaketi muttakaraṇatalaghātane_, “_Talaghātake_: hitting the genitals with the palm of the hand.” "
