  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:1.14.1": "It is often understood that a woman needs permission from both her parents and her husband to ordain as a _bhikkhunī_ Yet the rule uses the conjunction _vā_, which can only reasonably be rendered as “or”. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc80:2.1.16": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as in _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [Bu Ss 10:2.65](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
