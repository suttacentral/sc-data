  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63:1.13": "For the contextual meaning of the Pali, see [pli-tv-bi-vb-pc64:1.36.1](). ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63:2.1.12": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as at [pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65](), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. "
