  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:1.5": "In the sequence _uññāya paribhavena akkhantiyā vebhassiyā dubbalyā_ every word seems to be in the instrumental case except _dubbalyā_, which presumably is an ablative. This is unusual. The commentary, at Sp.2.727, says: _Dubbalyāti tumhākaṃ dubbalabhāvena_, “_Dubbalyā_: because of your weakness.” This implies that _dubbalyā_ is the only word in the sequence that does not refer to the Sangha, but rather to the misbehaving nuns, which would be odd. Yet the commentarial interpretation is supported by the word commentary below, which defines _dubbalyā_ as _apakkhatā_ , “because of lack of supporters”. I therefore feel compelled to follow the commentarial interpretation. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13:2.77": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet just below the text says that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. ",
