  "pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4:2.1.18": "The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such as in _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [Bu Ss 10:2.65](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”. ",
