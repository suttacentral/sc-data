  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np11:2.1.1": "_Garupāvuraṇa_. The _pāvuraṇa_ was a garment for lay people, used in much the same way as the upper robe was used by monastic. When you put it on, you _pārupati_ it, which is what you do with an upper robe. This again points to the small difference between monastic robes and lay people’s clothes at the time of the Buddha. This is presumably why Thullanandā could use such a cloak for herself, thereby effectively transforming it into a robe. "
