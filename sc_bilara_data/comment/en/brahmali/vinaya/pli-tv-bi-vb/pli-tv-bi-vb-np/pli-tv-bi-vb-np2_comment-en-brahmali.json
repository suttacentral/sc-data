  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:2.1.6": "That is, in-season robe-cloth is cloth obtained during the last month of the rainy season, while out-of-season robe-cloth is cloth obtained during the remaining eleven months of the year. See the Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī commentary. | According to the commentary to _bhikkhu nissaggiya pācittiya_ 3, Sp.1.499: _Kālepi ādissa dinnanti saṅghassa vā “idaṁ akālacīvara”nti uddisitvā dinnaṁ, ekapuggalassa vā “idaṁ tuyhaṁ dammī”ti dinnaṁ_, “‘Also, if it is given in the robe season, but it is designated’ means: it is given to the Sangha after designating it by saying, ‘This is out-of-season robe-cloth’, or it is given to an individual by saying, ‘I give this to you.’” In other words, it is designated as out-of-season cloth or designated to an individual. The commentary to the present rule, at Sp.2.740, adds that designating to a group is included in designated cloth: _Ādissa dinnanti sampattā bhājentūti vatvāpi idaṁ gaṇassa idaṁ tumhākaṁ dammīti vatvā vā dātukamyatāya pādamūle ṭhapetvā vā dinnampi ādissa dinnaṁ nāma hoti; etaṁ sabbampi akālacīvaraṁ_, “‘Given after designating’ means: if they give after saying, ‘Let those who are present share it out’, or after saying, ‘I give this to the group, to you’, or they place it at the feet (of the recipient) wishing to give, this is called ‘Given after designating’. All this is called out-of-season robe-cloth.” "
