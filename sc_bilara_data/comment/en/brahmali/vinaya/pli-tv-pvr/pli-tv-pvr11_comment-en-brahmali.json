  "pli-tv-pvr11:32.1": "At first sight the Pali appears to be a straightforward declarative statement (“a legal issue arising from a dispute is a legal issue arising from an accusation, a legal issue arising from an offense, and a legal issue arising from business”), not a question. Yet this would man that the next sentence is a direct contradiction to present one, which dos not fit the context. The sub-commentary clears this is up by saying it is meant as a question.
