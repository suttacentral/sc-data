  "sn36.4:1.2": "While the Buddha routinely spoke of various heavenly or lower realms, he only uses the term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pātāla</i> (“abyss”) in metaphorical senses (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn9.1/en/sujato#3.3'>SN 9.1:3.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.44/en/sujato#1.4'>SN 1.44:1.4</a>). Tālapuṭa refers to it as a place, but this is in a line of poetry referring to mythical dangers of the oceans (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag19.1/en/sujato#14.2'>Thag 19.1:14.2</a>). The “Abyss” in the Purāṇas is said to be the lowest of the seven nether realms, but it is no hell. Rather, it is the glorious, jewel-festooned city of the dragons, beneath which Viṣṇu dwells, and whose glories exceed even the heavens (Śiva Purāṇa 5.15; Agni Purāṇa 120.2; Nārada Purāṇa 1.3.38). Perhaps the Buddha rejected such a notion as incompatible with his cosmology. "
