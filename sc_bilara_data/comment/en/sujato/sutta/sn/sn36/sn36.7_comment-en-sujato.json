  "sn36.7:1.1": "This discourse shows how a practitioner first develops the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for gaining immersion, along with practicing “situational awareness” (sometimes called “mindfulness in daily life”), before developing insight into the nature of feelings. ",
  "sn36.7:1.2": "The “infirmary” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gilānasālā</i>) is mentioned only in this discourse and the next, and in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.121/en/sujato'>AN 5.121</a>. The practice of visiting people when sick to give encouragement and support is still an important part of Buddhist culture. ",
  "sn36.7:2.1": "The same treatment of being “mindful and aware” is at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#2.12.2'>DN 16:2.12.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.2/en/sujato'>SN 47.2</a>, and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.35/en/sujato'>SN 47.35</a>. ",
  "sn36.7:3.1": "In the Gradual Training, the mendicant “establishes mindfulness” to begin meditation. Here this practice is expanded, and it is expanded even further in the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn10/en/sujato'>MN 10</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn22/en/sujato'>DN 22</a>) and the Satipaṭṭhāna Saṁyutta beginning with <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.1/en/sujato'>SN 47.1</a>. ",
  "sn36.7:3.2": "This marks the first appearance of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satipaṭṭhāna</i> formula in the Saṁyutta. Despite the modern perception that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satipaṭṭhāna</i> is essentially the practice of insight, it appears nowhere in the great wisdom Saṁyuttas on dependent origination, the aggregates, the senses, or the elements. In the Suttas, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satipaṭṭhāna</i> is the support for immersion, with insight emerging from immersion. "
