  "sn36.6:1.25": "The ablative <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkhasmā</i> here is explained by the commentary as taking an instrumental sense, like the preceding terms. ",
  "sn36.6:4.1": "The text says they “do not feel” the feeling, thus directly contradicting the main theme of the discourse. Bodhi inserts “mental” to resolve this. The commentary does not notice this verse at all, as it only comments on “learned” after “appraised” in the next verse, suggesting that either the verse was inserted after the commentary, or that it posed no interpretive difficulties. The initial line is also metrically imperfect: as a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tuṭṭhubha</i>, the final syllable of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedayati</i> should be long; perhaps it was originally the reflexive <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedayate</i>. It seems to me the line is corrupt, and the simplest emendation is to assume a double negative that was later omitted; the omission of the negative is attested elsewhere in Pali verse (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.8/en/sujato#17.4'>Snp 3.8:17.4</a>). Or perhaps, without emending, the initial <i lang='pi' translate='no'>na</i> should be distributed to both noun and verb. ",
