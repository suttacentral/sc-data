  "sn36.1:1.1": "“Feeling” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedanā</i>) is the affective or hedonic tone of experience. Each sense can trigger a response of pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain. It is from the root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vid</i> (“know”), and is close in meaning to “experience”. For history, see note at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.1/en/sujato#2.8'>SN 12.1:2.8</a>. ",
  "sn36.1:2.1": "The text is not explicit as to who speaks these verses. Nor, for that matter, does it say who spoke the prose; the context is elided, presumably because the editors thought it was obvious that it is the Buddha speaking. The same is true of the verses. Indeed, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/iti52/en/sujato'>Iti 52</a> is otherwise identical to this discourse, except it indicates that the Buddha spoke both verse and prose. Whether the verses were added later is a separate matter, but clearly the text presents them as the Buddha’s words. ",
  "sn36.1:3.4": "By treating the feelings according to the four noble truths, the Buddha is implicitly situating all feelings as suffering. "
