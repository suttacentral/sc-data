  "sn38.3:1.4": "“Holy One” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sugata</i>) is a frequent epithet of the Buddha, or as here, for any arahant. Formally, it parallels “Realized One” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathāgata</i>), i.e. “one who has come to the state of truth”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sugata</i> therefore means “one who has come to the state of the good/happy/well”. These are past participles; the noun form of the same word is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sugati</i>, a “good place” or “heaven”. It is a term primarily associated with Buddhism; in later Sanskrit, followers of the Buddha were called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bauddha</i> or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saugata</i>. "
