  "sn3.13:1.2": "A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>doṇa</i> (“bucketful”) was a wooden trough to receive the filtered Soma (Rig Veda 4.32.17). In the Arthaśāstra it measures feed for horses (2.30.12) and elephants (2.15.50). One <i lang='pi' translate='no'>doṇa</i> was the monthly allotment of grain for a servant (Manu 7.126). Olivelle estimates it at 5 liters or 9.6 kg (<em>King, Governance, and Law</em>, appendix 2, pg. 458). | The use of present tense (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhuñjati</i>) here indicates that it is an ongoing situation, not just a single large meal (compare the aorist in the previous Sutta).

  "sn3.13:3.3": "For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedanā</i> as “discomfort”, compare the stock reflection on eating (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.120/en/sujato#4.3'>SN 35.120:4.3</a>). ",

Here and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn94/en/sujato#33.1'>MN 94:33.1</a> it refers to money. ",
  "sn3.13:6.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Nālikā</i> was a cup made from a hollow bamboo.

It does not appear in this sense in the Arthaśāstra, but the <em>Indian Epigraphical Glossary</em> says it is one-sixteenth of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>doṇa</i> and equivalent to a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>prastha</i>. Olivelle estimates the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>prastha</i> at around 600g, which is indeed one sixteenth of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>doṇa</i>.

  "sn3.13:6.2": "Interesting use of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sallikhati</i> = <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sallekha</i> (“cut down” = “slimmed”), related to the idea of “effacing” writing as the stone wears away.
