  "sn35.243:1.2": "The completion of a town hall was celebrated by a talk for the Sakyans at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn53/en/sujato#2.1'>MN 53:2.1</a> and the Mallas at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.2.1'>DN 33:1.2.1</a>. Such halls were community meeting places that played a central role in civic society and communal decision-making in democratic republics such as the Mallas and the Sakyans. The Buddha’s participation is a sign of his support for their civic and democratic process; he is not said to attend any comparable civic events for kings. ",
  "sn35.243:2.8": "The Buddha refers to the Sakyans as “Gotamas” after the lineage of the family priest (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>purohita</i>). Thus “Gotama” is not a personal name of the Buddha. In a similar context at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn33/en/sujato#1.4.5'>DN 33:1.4.5</a>, the Buddha refers to the Mallas after their priestly lineage, Vāseṭṭha. ",
  "sn35.243:3.4": "The Buddha’s bad back is mentioned several times in similar contexts, suggesting that such events took place in his old age. It serves as a reminder that freedom from attachment to the body does not mean one must forcefully endure pain. ",
  "sn35.243:3.12": "“Festering” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>avassuta</i>, literally “that which has been flowed down into”. "
