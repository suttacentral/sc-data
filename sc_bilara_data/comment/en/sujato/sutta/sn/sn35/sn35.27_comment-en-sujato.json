  "sn35.27:1.3": "The phrase “eye, sights, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness” appears redundant, as “sights” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i>) are precisely what is “knowable by eye consciousness”. Where the phrase occurs elsewhere, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i> may appear (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn112/en/sujato#10.2'>MN 112:10.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.65/en/sujato#2.1'>SN 35.65:2.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.68/en/sujato#1.3'>SN 35.68:1.3</a>) or it may not (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn144/en/sujato#9.1'>MN 144:9.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.87/en/sujato#7.1'>SN 35.87:7.1</a>). Bodhi summarizes the commentary’s explanations, which he describes as “contrived” (<em>Middle Length Discourses</em>, note 1080, and <em>Connected Discourses</em> note 12 on book 4). At least one Chinese parallel omits <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i> here, thus avoiding the redundancy (MA 187 at T i 732c19). It is likely the original passage did not include <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i> and it was added in an old editorial oversight. "
