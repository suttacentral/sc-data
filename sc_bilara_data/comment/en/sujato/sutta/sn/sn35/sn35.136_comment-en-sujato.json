  "sn35.136:2.4": "Notice the positive association of “exist” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi</i>). ",
  "sn35.136:7.4": "Bodhi translates “dullards”, evidently reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>magā</i> (“beasts”) and taking to mean “fools”. However, I can’t find support for this sense in Pali or Sanskrit. The commentary explains it as those inexpert in knowing what is the path and what is not the path, apparently taking <i lang='pi' translate='no'>maggā</i> as a truncation of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>maggāmagga</i>. I read as a secondary derivative from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>magga</i> in the old sense “seeking”, with the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-a</i> suffix making it the agentive “seekers”. "
