  "sn35.93:1.1": "Yājñavalkya taught that the ultimate Self was “this great reality, infinite, unbounded, a sheer mass of consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>idaṁ mahadbhūtam anantam apāraṁ vijñānaghana eva</i>, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12). It arises as an individuated self from the mass of particularized elements making up the world, but for the realized being it returns to its essential oneness with Divinity. Thus Yājñavalkya spoke of the “uncognized cognizer”, the eternal and changeless core of awareness at the heart of the ephemeral world of changing illusions. Rejecting this, the Buddha asserts that consciousness, far from being an eternal or mysterious essence, is dependent on the dualistic structure of experience. ",
