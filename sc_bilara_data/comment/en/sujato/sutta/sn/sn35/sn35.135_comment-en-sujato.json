  "sn35.135:1.3": "According to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#22.2'>MN 50:22.2</a>, this is a name for the Great Hell. It is, therefore, a literal name for hell, not a metaphor for hell as nothing more than sense experience. The hell called “The Mighty Fever” is described in similar terms at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn56.43/en/sujato'>SN 56.43</a>. "
