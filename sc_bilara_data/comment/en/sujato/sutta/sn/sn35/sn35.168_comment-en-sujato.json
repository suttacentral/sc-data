  "sn35.168:1.1": "This chapter is titled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṭṭhipeyyālavagga</i>, “The Chapter of Sixty Abbreviated Texts”. I follow MS, BJT, and Bodhi, which give the full count of sixty. The PTS edition, by combining each triad of discourses as one, numbers only 19 discourses up to 186. Its numbering remains out of sync for the remainder of this Saṁyutta. "
