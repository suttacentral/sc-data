  "sn35.4:1.5": "“Sounds” are mentioned as “exterior” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bāhya</i>) in Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.7, as opposed to the Divinity that has neither interior nor exterior (2.5.19). This anticipates the Buddhist association of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bāhira</i> with sense objects. This particular passage is full of echoes with Buddhism. "
