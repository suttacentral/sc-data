  "sn35.74:11.1": "The expression <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rāgavirāga</i> plays on two senses of the word. The root sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rāga</i> is “dye” or “color”, especially red (cf. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rajaka</i>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#27.14'>MN 56:27.14</a>) . From there it took on the sense “greed, lust, passion” which dominates in Pali. Thus <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rāgavirāga</i> is both the “fading of color” and the “dispassion of passion”. It is a term for the quelling of harmful emotions (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an2.31/en/sujato'>AN 2.31</a>). "
