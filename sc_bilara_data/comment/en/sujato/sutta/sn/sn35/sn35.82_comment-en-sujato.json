  "sn35.82:2.3": "The Pali puns <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lujjati</i> (“wear away”) with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>loka</i> (“world”). Normally <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lujjati</i> is “fall apart, disintegrate” (see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.93/en/sujato'>SN 22.93</a>), but where it puns with “world” (here and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.84/en/sujato'>SN 35.84</a>) I translate as “wear away”, which is justified by the use at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.132/en/sujato#1.7'>AN 3.132:1.7</a>. This pun might seem obvious to “world-weary” folks of today, but it is the deliberate opposite of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>loka</i>’s underlying sense. It originally referred to “light”, especially the bright lights of the heavens, hence “cosmos” and “world” generally. See note on <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn7/en/sujato#19.6'>MN 7:19.6</a> for details. "
