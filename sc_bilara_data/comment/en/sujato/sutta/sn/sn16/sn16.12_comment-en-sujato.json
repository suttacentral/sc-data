  "sn16.12:1.4": "An awakened one, whether the Buddha or anyone else, exists after death, for example in an eternal state of Nirvana. | Here “realized one” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathāgata</i>) pertains to any arahant, as at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn54.12/en/sujato'>SN 54.12</a>. The Pali commentary says that a “living being” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satta</i>) is meant. However, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathāgata</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satta</i> are exact verbal parallels: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathā</i> (“real”) + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gata</i> (“come to the state of”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa</i> (“real”) + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tta</i> (“state of”). Thus it seems likely that this was originally intended as a mere verbal gloss to explain the compound. That it does not mean just any sentient being is established at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.86/en/sujato#1.5'>SN 22.86:1.5</a>. ",

  "sn16.12:1.10": "This kind of “both A and not A” statements are not meant to be paradoxical or mystical. Rather, they represent some state that combines elements of both. For example, their body does not exist but their mind does. ",
  "sn16.12:1.13": "Likewise, “neither A nor not A” is not meant to be a paradox, but to indicate something that cannot be characterized by the original term. For example, a sage persists after death in a subtle state that is not what we normally consider existence. ",
