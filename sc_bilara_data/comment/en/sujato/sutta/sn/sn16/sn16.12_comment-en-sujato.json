  "sn16.12:1.4": "An awakened one, whether the Buddha or anyone else, exists after death, for example in an eternal state of Nirvana. | Here “realized one” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathāgata</i>) pertains to any arahant, as at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn54.12/en/sujato'>SN 54.12</a>. The Pali commentary says that a “living being” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satta</i>) is meant. However, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathāgata</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satta</i> are exact verbal parallels: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathā</i> (“real”) + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gata</i> (“come to the state of”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa</i> (“real”) + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tta</i> (“state of”). Thus it seems likely that this was originally intended as a mere verbal gloss to resolve the compound. That it does not mean just any sentient being is established at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.86/en/sujato#1.5'>SN 22.86:1.5</a>. ",
