However, despite the length of that narrative, only the fourth and fifth are included there. This situation mirrors the Mahāparinibbānasutta, where there are also events missing from the narrative as we have it. Either parts were lost, or the compilers left out some events for some reason. ",
  "sn4.1:1.2": "In modern times this is the pilgrimage site Bodhgaya in the Gaya district of Bihar. It lies by a wide river that is dry in summer but abundant in the rains. In Pali the river is called Nerañjarā, which  is of unclear meaning, but the commentary suggests “sweet waters” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nela-jala</i>) or “blue waters” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nīla-jala</i>). The Sanskrit is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nairañjanā</i>, which suggests the sense “unblemished”. Today it is called the Līlajan (or Nīlajan). | Uruvelā, which aptly means “Broadbanks”, was a locality centered around the market town of Senānigama (“Marshalltown”). There was also a sizable hermitage nearby with matted-hair Brahmanical ascetics (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jaṭilā</i>) who ritually bathed in the water (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#20.15.1'>Kd 1:20.15.1</a>).

  "sn4.1:2.1": "Māra is sometimes called Namuci, and in fact seems to descend from the Vedic adversary of that name. Vedic Namuci “the wicked” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāpmā vai namuciḥ</i>, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3, Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.4.4) was a wily trickster (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>māyin</i>, Rig Veda 1.53.7c) who was nonetheless outsmarted by Indra (Rig Veda 5.30.6c), and possessed ineffectual armies reliant on women (Rig Veda 5.30.9a). Buddhist Māra “the wicked” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>māro pāpimā</i>) was a wily trickster (<em>passim</em>) who was nonetheless outsmarted by the Buddha and his followers (<em>passim</em>); he possessed ineffectual armies (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#21.3'>DN 20:21.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.13/en/sujato#2.3'>AN 4.13:2.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.2/en/sujato'>Snp 3.2</a>), and sent his daughters to do his dirty work (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.25/en/sujato'>SN 4.25</a>). The decapitated head of Namuci introduced death (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mṛtyu</i>) in the form of blood to the deathless (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>amṛta</i>) soma (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 12.7.3.4, Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.4.4), establishing his Pali names Maccurāja, “King of Death” and Māra, “Murderer”. He appears in a similar guise in Jainism too (Ācaraṅga 1.3.1.3). ",

The commentary explains that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amara</i> here is “immortality”, and the phrase means “fervent mortification aimed at immortality”. However, I find this unconvincing, one reason being that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amara</i> is an adjective (and thus must be glossed with an abstract noun in dative, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarabhāvatthāya</i>). It is simpler to assume Pali has an idiomatic sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amara</i> as “endless”, which occurs here, in the phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarāvikkhepa</i> (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.23.1'>DN 1:2.23.1</a>), and in the Niddesa’s <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarāvitakka</i> (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/cnd12/en/sujato#6.1'>Cnd 12:6.1</a>). Then <i lang='pi' translate='no'>amarā</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bahū</i> are synonyms.
