It also appears in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.44/en/sujato'>AN 6.44</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.75/en/sujato'>AN 10.75</a>, and is defined in the Paṭisambhidāmagga as the four absorptions and four formless attainments (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ps1.5/en/sujato#26.2'>Ps 1.5:26.2</a>). ",
  "sn4.23:1.5": "The commentary explains that he was chronically ill, so could not progress in meditation despite strenuous efforts over a long time. ",
  "sn4.23:2.3": "The idiomatic phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satthahāraka</i> (its verbal form here <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satthaṁ āhareyyaṁ</i> is reflexive optative first singular) is difficult. The obvious reading is to take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattha</i> as “knife”. However, that yields the sense “knife-bringer”, “assassin”, whereas the use of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>idaṁ</i> in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn145/en/sujato#5.32'>MN 145:5.32</a> shows it must be neuter, i.e. it is a thing not a person. Richard Gombrich suggests we read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattha</i> here as equivalent to Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>śvasita</i>, “breathing, life” (see Brahmali’s note on <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3/en/sujato#2.49.1'>Bu Pj 3:2.49.1</a>), yielding the sense “life-taker”, “breath-stealer”, “deadly weapon”. This agrees with the Vinaya commentary, which explains, “What does it take? Life.” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kiṃ harati? Jīvitaṁ</i>). Since this idiom is only used in the context of suicide, I use the normal English term. ",
  "sn4.23:3.1": "Māra uncharacteristically showers the Buddha with praise. It seems he is afraid that Godhika will slip beyond his grasp. ",
  "sn4.23:4.4": "“Light-bringer” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jutindhara</i>) is a curious epithet for Māra to use, not least because it is etymologically parallel to “Lucifer”. ",
  "sn4.23:7.4": "The Buddha confirms that he had attained arahantship, or irreversible liberation, which must have been shortly before he died. The Buddhist tradition says that only an arahant is allowed to take their own life, and only then in cases of terminal illness. However, it is possible to read the scriptural passages the other way. Since an arahant is incapable of doing anything wrong, the fact that they killed themselves shows there is nothing wrong with voluntary euthanasia in cases of incurable and imminent terminal illness. ",
  "sn4.23:9.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vivatta</i> (or <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vivaṭṭa</i>) often means “cast off”, as in “the fetters” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vivattayi saṁyojanaṁ</i>) or the “veil” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vivaṭṭacchada</i>). Here it describes the dead monk’s body after attaining final Nibbana. ",
  "sn4.23:10.7": "The “arched harp” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vīṇa</i>) was a multi-stringed instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. Pañcasikha’s harp is described in the same way (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.2.4'>DN 21:1.2.4</a>), and tradition says they were in fact the same instrument. ",
