  "sn33.26-30:1.2": "From here to the end of the Saṁyutta, we find a series of terms for “understanding” that do not appear elsewhere in the early canon. It stretches credulity, even by the repetitive standards of the Suttas, that Vacchagotta would have continued asking the same question dozens of times and the Buddha answer only by changing the verb. Likely the redactors introduced these terms, showing the influence of the Abhidhamma on the Saṁyutta. "
