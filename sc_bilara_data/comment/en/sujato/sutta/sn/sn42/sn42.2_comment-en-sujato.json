  "sn42.2:1.2": "His verses at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag19.1/en/sujato'>Thag 19.1</a> speak eloquently of the tension between the worldly and the spiritual life. | The name <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tālapuṭa</i> is explained by the commentary as due to his face being the color of a fresh palmyra fruit (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tāla</i>). This, however, leaves the element <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puṭa</i> (“pouch”) unexplained. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Tālapuṭa</i> is known in Jain texts as a kind of poison (Uttarādhyayana Sūtra 16, verse 13;  Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣa Caritra 1.2). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Tāla</i> can mean “yellow orpiment”, a kind of arsenic used for coloring (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig14.1/en/sujato#28.1'>Thig 14.1:28.1</a>), so <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tālapuṭa</i> would mean “pouch of arsenic”. As to why someone would have such a name, the protagonist of Isibhāsiyāiṁ 10.13—a government minister (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>amacca</i>) named Tetaliputta—recounts having survived <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tālapuṭa</i> poisoning. His life was, it seems, a series of tragedies leading him to an elaborate series of failed suicide attempts. While his story is unlike Tālapuṭa’s, the rhetoric is curiously similar: both rely on repeated, plaintive rhetorical questions to express emotional torment; for Tālapuṭa it is “when will it be?”, for Tetaliputta “who will believe me?” I wonder whether these stories share some connection. Perhaps the similar-sounding names have become confused, or perhaps he became known for the poison he survived. ",
