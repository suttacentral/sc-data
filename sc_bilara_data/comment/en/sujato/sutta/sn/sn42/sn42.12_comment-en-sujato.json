  "sn42.12:16.4": "In Buddhism, a “skillful quality” would refer to the “ten ways of doing skillful deeds”, which are good qualities for a human life lived well.

  "sn42.12:22.1": "The middle way is described as a “wearing away” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nijjara</i>). The Jains believed that through the practice of austerities one could “wear away” past bad deeds (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#17.5'>MN 14:17.5</a>) and future suffering (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#17.8'>MN 14:17.8</a>). The Buddha distinguishes the term from self-mortification and adapts it for Buddhist use, with “wearing away” applied to the defilements that produce suffering.
