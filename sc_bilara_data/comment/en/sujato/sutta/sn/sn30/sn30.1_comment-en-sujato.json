  "sn30.1:1.2": "The <i lang='pi' translate='no'>supaṇṇa</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>suparṇa</i>, “bright-feathered”), later <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuḷa</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>garuḍa</i>, “devourer”), is to the eagle as the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāga</i> is to the cobra. He has been falsely compared with the loathsome harpy; but his golden wings, closeness to the sun (eg. Rig Veda 5.47.3), and role as bearer of the nectar of immortality (RV 4.26.4, 8.100.8) show that he is the Indian phoenix, the golden eagle of the sun. As the brother of Aruṇa the Dawn (Matsya Purāṇa 174.47), his golden wings at sunset “devour” the sun. He disappears in darkness only to be born again the next day, just as the European phoenix combusts itself and is born anew. Thus he is both the older and the younger brother of Aruṇa, for which came first, sunrise or sunset? "
