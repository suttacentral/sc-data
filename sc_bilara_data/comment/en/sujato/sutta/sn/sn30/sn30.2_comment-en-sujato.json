  "sn30.2:1.6": "The enmity between snakes and birds is legendary (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja518/en/sujato'>Ja 518</a>), its origins related in the story of Suparṇa and Kadrū, mother of dragons (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.6.2). It is rooted as much in the common sight of birds attacking snakes as it is in the cosmic opposition between the solar and the chthonic, the forces of light in the sky and darkness beneath the earth. Only the Buddha could reconcile them (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato#11.16'>DN 20:11.16</a>). "
