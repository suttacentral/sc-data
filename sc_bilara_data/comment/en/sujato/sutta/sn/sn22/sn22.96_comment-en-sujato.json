  "sn22.96:3.1": "These details are greatly expanded in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato'>DN 17</a>, where the Buddha names himself Mahāsudassana. ",
  "sn22.96:3.3": "“Palace” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, literally “stilt longhouse”. ",
  "sn22.96:3.4": "“Chamber” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kūṭāgāra</i>, literally “building with peaked roof”. Normally this means “bungalow”, but in a similar description at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#8.9'>MN 37:8.9</a> we hear of a “palace” with a hundred “towers” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>niyyūha</i>), each of which has seven hundred “chambers”. Thus the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kūṭāgāra</i> must be a structure many of which can belong to a palace, namely “chamber”, while <i lang='pi' translate='no'>byūha</i> (spelled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>viyūha</i> at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.5.3'>DN 17:2.5.3</a>) must have the same meaning as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>niyyūha</i>, i.e. “tower”.

  "sn22.96:4.8": "Readings here and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.15.8'>DN 17:2.15.8</a> are confused, and further complicated at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/tha-ap411/en/sujato#4.1'>Tha Ap 411:4.1</a>. I read  <i lang='pi' translate='no'>velāsikā</i> due to the passage’s similarity to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn23/en/sujato#15.4'>DN 23:15.4</a>, where a “coquette” (literally, “party girl”) is also serving a royal.
