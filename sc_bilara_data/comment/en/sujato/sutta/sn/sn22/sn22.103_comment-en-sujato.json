  "sn22.103:1.4": "Usually (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.105/en/sujato'>SN 22.105</a>), these four are presented without being suffixed with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-anta</i> (“end”), the contextual meaning of which is not entirely clear. The commentary says <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anta</i> here means “portion”, but this is poorly attested. In philosophical contexts, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anta</i> means “extreme”, but this could not be used for the four noble truths. Perhaps the obvious meaning is the correct one: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anta</i> means “end”, which in the case of suffering and its origin means death, and in the case of the path and the end of suffering means Nibbana. The teaching would then be that all you are attached to will end in any case, but Nibbana is the end free of suffering. ",
