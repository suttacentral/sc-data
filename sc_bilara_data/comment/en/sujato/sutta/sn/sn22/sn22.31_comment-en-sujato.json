  "sn22.31:1.2": "“Gloom” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>agha</i>) seems to have originally had the sense of “darkness, void”, a name for the black, starless reaches of space (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn123/en/sujato#7.4'>MN 123:7.4</a>; cf. Rig Veda 10.85.13, for which read “blacknesses”). Legend depicts Agha as a vast serpent of foul-smelling, cave-like maw who devours the innocent. Hence the black evil of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>agha</i> is driven away by the blazing fire (Rig Veda 1.97). But whereas the Vedic usage associates <i lang='pi' translate='no'>agha</i> with evil, malignant deeds—and hence the second noble truth, that which perpetuates suffering—in Buddhism it is associated with the first noble truth, suffering itself.
