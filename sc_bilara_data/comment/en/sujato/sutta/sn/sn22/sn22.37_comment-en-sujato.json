These characteristics apply equally on the scale of a moment, the unfolding of an experience, a lifetime, or a cosmic eon. | This apparently innocuous formulation became the subject of controversy between the different Abhidhamma schools as they tried to specify their theory of momentariness. Some, such as the Theravada of the Mahāvihāra in Sri Lanka, defined these as sub-moments of a single moment. The Sarvāstivādins added a fourth sub-moment (decaying), while the Sautrāntikas had just arising and ceasing. These explanations are not relevant for the Suttas, which have no theory of momentariness. ",
