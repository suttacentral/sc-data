  "sn22.6:1.2": "Mendicants should “meditate in retreat” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṭisallāṇe yogamāpajjatha</i>) in order to understand the six senses (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.100/en/sujato'>SN 35.100</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.161/en/sujato'>SN 35.161</a>) and the four noble truths (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn56.2/en/sujato'>SN 56.2</a>). | Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yoga</i> (“yoke”) can mean “effort”, as in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yogaṁ āpajjati</i>, “engage in effort (regarding that)”, which I render “get involved (in that)” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an7.28/en/sujato#1.7'>AN 7.28:1.7</a>). Compare the English expression “harness energy”.  The related expression <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yogamāpajjatha</i> is literally “engage in effort in retreat”. This means primarily to meditate, and indeed Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yoga</i> shades into the sense “meditation, immersion” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp282/en/sujato#1'>Dhp 282:1</a>), a sense that anticipates Patañjali’s definition of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yoga</i> as “the cessation of transformations of mind” (Yogasūtra 1.2).
