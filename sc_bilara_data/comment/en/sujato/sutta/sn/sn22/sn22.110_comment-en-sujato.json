  "sn22.110:1.5": "The stream-enterer (as in the previous discourse) and the perfected one (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahant</i>) share the same understanding of the aggregates as they truly are, but the arahant has fully let go of all grasping. Note too that the stream-enterer is said to be a “noble disciple”, which includes lay people, but the arahant is a “mendicant”. The discourses do not say that formal ordination is a requirement for arahantship, but they consistently treat the arahant as one who lives the renunciate life of a mendicant. "
