  "sn22.78:2.11": "When the same parable is told at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.33/en/sujato'>AN 4.33</a>, it is in response to the Buddha’s teaching on “substantial reality”, lending the discourse greater coherence. Since the aggregates are elsewhere said to be “substantial reality”, perhaps the parable was adapted in this form. "
