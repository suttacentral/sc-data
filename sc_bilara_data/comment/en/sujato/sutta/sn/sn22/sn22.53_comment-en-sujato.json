  "sn22.53:2.2": "The process of rebirth is often described in terms of consciousness, as in dependent origination or, say, the “stream of consciousness” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn28/en/sujato#7.13'>DN 28:7.13</a>). However, consciousness never exists by itself, but only in relation to the other aggregates. The case of the formless realm might seem an exception, yet even formless rebirth is dependent on form of the past, since the four “form” absorptions are the basis for the formless attainments.
