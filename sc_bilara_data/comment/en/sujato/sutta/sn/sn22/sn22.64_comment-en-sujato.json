  "sn22.64:1.4": "To “conceive” or “imagine” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>maññati</i>) is, according to the commentary, to think in terms of a “self”, proliferating experience through craving, conceit, or views until it is constructed <em>for me</em>. This usage draws upon such passages as Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.20, where due to ignorance, a person “imagines” in a dream the fearful things they saw when awake, or at the highest level, “imagines I am this all” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ahamevedaṁ sarvo’smīti manyate</i>). See <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn1/en/sujato#3.3'>MN 1:3.3</a>. "
