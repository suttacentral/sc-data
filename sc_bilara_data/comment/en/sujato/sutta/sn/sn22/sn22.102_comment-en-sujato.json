  "sn22.102:2.1": "Not sure why BB has “ploughshare” here. The ploughshare is the blade, which is nangalaphāla. Nangala must mean the whole plough, which can be carried on a shoulder as in SN 4.19. Also, rootlets is a mistake. Rootlets are the young sprouts, but the word here is mūlasantānakāni, where santanaka means “continuity”, i.e. “network”. ",
