Note that when <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhante therā</i> is used above, the plural <i lang='pi' translate='no'>therā</i> is nominative, whereas here the singular is vocative. ",

  "sn41.2:2.4": "The expression “senior venerable” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyasmā thero</i>), found in this sutta and the next, is rare, and in early Pali invariably associated with some failing of the senior monastics. In <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn21.10/en/sujato'>SN 21.10</a> a “Venerable Senior” is suggested to be senior in name only, while in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato'>SN 22.90</a> the advice of the senior venerables is ineffectual. Perhaps the piling up of excessive titles was felt to be a sign of pomposity. ",
