  "sn41.8:1.1": "This is Mahāvīra, who according to Buddhist accounts died before the Buddha, so if this is a genuine encounter it must have been while the Buddha was still alive. The whole story seems a little parodic, although Citta’s eagerness to trounce Mahāvīra is very much in character. ",

  "sn41.8:2.4": "It is not easy to trace details of early Jain meditation. For the most part they focused on austerities and self-mortification, which the Buddha found to be counterproductive to deep meditation (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato#33.2'>MN 36:33.2</a>). ",
  "sn41.8:3.3": "Citta uses the same technique employed so often by the Buddha: start by finding something in common. The superiority of knowledge over faith is a philosophical point in which Buddhism and Jainism are in agreement. ",

  "sn41.8:5.9": "This passage echoes <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.27/en/sujato#9.2'>AN 10.27:9.2</a>, where the Buddha recommends asking this series of questions of a sectarian in order to stump them. | The grammar of these questions is peculiar, for which see Bodhi’s note 323 in <em>Connected Discourses</em> and 2003 in <em>Numerical Discourses</em>. ",
  "sn41.8:5.19": "This whole passage is, I think, Pali for: “You are so pwned. Delete your account.” "
