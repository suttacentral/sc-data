  "sn12.20:2.3": "The principles of the Dhamma are not impermanent, since they are not things that exist. Rather, they are laws of nature that describe a process or a pattern which is always observable, so it is always true to describe it in that way. At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.136/en/sujato'>AN 3.136</a> the same idea applies to impermanence, suffering and not-self. Also see Poṭṭhapāda at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn9/en/sujato#31.10'>DN 9:31.10</a>. | For “surety” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>niyāmatā</i>) compare Rig Veda 4.3.9, “With truth I invoke the truth set down” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ṛtena ṛtaṁ niyatam</i>). It is related to the idea that the stream-enterer “steps into the sure path”, i.e. enters the noble eightfold path, and is therefore “sure” in the sense of confident, and “sure” in the sense of being bound for awakening.
