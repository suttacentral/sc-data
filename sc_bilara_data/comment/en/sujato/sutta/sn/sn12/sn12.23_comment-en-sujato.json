There, the initial term is ablative, which conveys the <em>causal</em> sense and might be literally rendered, “Due to the ignorance dependency, choices”. Here the two terms are both nominative, so there is no causal sense in the nouns. We must assume, then, that the causal sense is supplied by the implicit verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hoti</i> in the pregnant sense “bring about, beget, yield”.
