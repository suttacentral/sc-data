  "sn44.7:2.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Loka</i> originally meant “light”, hence the sky bright with gods (stars), from which developed the meanings “heaven”, a “world”, and the “cosmos”. Sometimes Vedists believed that an “eternal world” was won by those worthy (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.31.5'>DN 1:1.31.5</a>). However, the Suttas often discuss the Upaniṣadic notion that the “self and the cosmos are eternal” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.30.1'>DN 1:1.30.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn102/en/sujato#14.2'>MN 102:14.2</a>), where <i lang='pi' translate='no'>loka</i> means the “cosmos” as a whole, not a specific heavenly “world”. But the distinction is not always clear-cut. See also next note. ",
  "sn44.7:2.4": "",
  "sn44.7:2.7": "The distinction between a limited “world” and an infinite “cosmos” was said to depend on the wisdom and spiritual depth of the individual: “Those who venerate (water, breath, and moon) as finite win only a limited world, whereas those who venerate them as infinite win a world without limit” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.5.13, Olivelle translation). ",
  "sn44.7:2.13": "The term “soul” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jīva</i>) was favored by the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samaṇas</i>, as opposed to the “self” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>attā</i>) of the brahmins. Both are rejected by the Buddha as forms of “metaphysical” self: they postulate the absolute, eternal existence of entities that cannot be established empirically. The repeated demonstrative pronouns (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>taṁ jīvaṁ taṁ sarīraṁ</i>) assert an emphatic identity. "
