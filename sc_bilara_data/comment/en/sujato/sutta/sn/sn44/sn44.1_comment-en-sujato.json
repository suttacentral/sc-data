It seems they formed a kind of scheme for evaluating and positioning different philosophies, which were assumed to answer them definitively. They are discussed many times in the Suttas, eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn16.12/en/sujato'>SN 16.12</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn24.15/en/sujato'>SN 24.15</a>–18, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn33.1/en/sujato'>SN 33.1</a>–55.

The Pali commentary says that a “living being” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satta</i>) is meant. However, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathāgata</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satta</i> are exact verbal parallels: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tathā</i> (“real”) + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gata</i> (“come to the state of”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sa</i> (“real”) + <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tta</i> (“state of”). Thus it seems likely that this was originally intended as a mere verbal gloss to explain the compound.
