  "sn34.5:1.4": "“Support” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ārammaṇa</i>, namely the different subjects of meditation. This is the only term in this list that does not appear elsewhere in the early canon. It does not mean “object”, which is exclusively a later sense, derived from the (again later) use of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kasiṇa</i> as a physical “object” or “disk” on which to focus attention (for the Sutta usage, see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#24.11'>MN 77:24.11</a>). An “object” is something that has an “objective” reality independent of the observer. But for the Suttas, meditations like the breath, or love, or an inner reflection on mortality are dimensions of living experience that change and grow through and with the course of meditation. The meditation subject is not something <em>at which</em> the mind is directed, it is something <em>with which</em> the mind grows. "
