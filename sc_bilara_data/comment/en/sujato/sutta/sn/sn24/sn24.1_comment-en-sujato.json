  "sn24.1:1.4": "These peculiar beliefs are found in Pali only in this chapter, and I have not been able to trace them elsewhere. Nonetheless, the expression “standing firm like a pillar” is associated with eternalism generally (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#1.33.11'>DN 1:1.33.11</a>), and here links up with the seven uncreated substances (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn24.8/en/sujato#1.3'>SN 24.8:1.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn76/en/sujato#16.2'>MN 76:16.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#26.2'>DN 2:26.2</a>). This is attributed to Pakudha Kaccāyana, who is associated with the Ājivakas. Probably this is an expression of the Ājivaka belief that reality is fixed and change an illusion (Basham, <em>History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas</em>, p. 236). | The form for “rivers” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>najjo</i>, irregular nominative plural of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nadī</i>) is unique to this passage.

  "sn24.1:4.11": "This set appears at first glance to be somewhat arbitrary, as it combines some of the senses with meditation attainments. But it is not a description of sense experience. Rather, it describes how religious or spiritual beliefs come about, which is why smell, taste, and touch are omitted, and why it is introduced in this chapter. The truth, or what is believed to be the truth, is realized from something “seen” (as a vision, or the sight of a pure being), “heard” (as teaching or scripture), “thought” (as philosophical reasoning), “known” (through meditation), or “attained, sought, and explored by the mind”, which likewise all refer to meditative realization.
