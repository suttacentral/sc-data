  "sn2.3:3.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vatrabhū</i> is the Pali spelling of Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vṛtrahan</i>, “slayer of the Constrictor”; this is the only time it appears in Pali. Vṛtra was a massive cobra whose defeat at the hands of Indra/Sakka was a primordial Vedic myth (eg. Rig Veda 1.32). Vṛtra, who was identified with wickedness (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.1.5.7), held the waters imprisoned. The release of the waters for the good of all is the primary symbol of Indra’s bounty. "
