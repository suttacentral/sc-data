  "kp9:6.1": "_Nikujjati_ means to “turn upside down”, most familiar in the case of when the Sangha in extreme circumstances to “upturn the bowl” (_pattaṁ nikujjati_). Most translators follow the comm. here (_vañceyya_, “trick, deceive”). However Ñāṇamoḷi has “work another’s undoing”. I think the sense is that one should not turn away from or avert one’s gaze from another. "
