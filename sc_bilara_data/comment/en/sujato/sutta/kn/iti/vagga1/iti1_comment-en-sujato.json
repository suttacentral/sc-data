  "iti1:4.1": "We find the same tag in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud1.10/en/sujato'>Ud 1.10</a>, except with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>udāno</i> in place of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attho</i>. This confirms that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attha</i> here refers to the “substance” or “main matter” of the text (rather than the “meaning”). In other words, this indicates the portion that was spoken by the Buddha, specifically the preceding verses. "
