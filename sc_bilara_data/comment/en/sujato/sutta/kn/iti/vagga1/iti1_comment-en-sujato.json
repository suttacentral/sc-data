  "iti1:4.1": "We find the same tag in <a href='/ud1.10/en/sujato'>Ud 1.10</a>, except with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>udāno</i> in place of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attho</i>. This confirms that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attha</i> here refers to the “substance” or “main matter” of the text, in other words, the portion that was spoken by the Buddha, which is usually the prose teaching, rather than connecting phrases or summary verses.
