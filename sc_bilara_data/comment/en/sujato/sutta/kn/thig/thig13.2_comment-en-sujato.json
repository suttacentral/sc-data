  "thig13.2:13.3": "“Prepared\n by others” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pariniṭṭhita</i>. The same phrase is at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig13.2/en/sujato#13.3'>Thig 13.2:13.3</a>, \nwhere it is spelled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>para-</i> (“other”), which I assume is correct. Mendicants do not cook, but rely on what is cooked by others. "
