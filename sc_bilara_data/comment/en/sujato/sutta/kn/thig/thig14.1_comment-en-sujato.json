  "thig14.1:10.4": "“Pixie” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kinnarī</i>, this marking the only appearance of these charming woodland sprites in early Pali; but see the synonymous <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kiṁpurisa</i> at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an2.60/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 2.60:1.1</a>. They share with the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandhabba</i> the attributes of being divine musicians, sometimes half-horse (or later, half-bird), and being sensual lovers; but where the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandhabba</i> is associated with licentiousness, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kinnara</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kinnarī</i> live together as a perfect dyad of lovers, ever entranced with one another. They are spirits of nature, hidden in the mountains, and threatened by human encroachment (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja485/en/sujato'>Ja 485</a>. Occasionally, however, a human tribe in the mountains of Kashmir is called Kinnara (= Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh?). | The beauty of the pixie’s eyes are praised at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja458/en/sujato#1.3'>Ja 458:1.3</a>, while the phrase “captivating eyes” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mandalocana</i>) is used of a divine maiden at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.5.26'>DN 21:1.5.26</a>.
