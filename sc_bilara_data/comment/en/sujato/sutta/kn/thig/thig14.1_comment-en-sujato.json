They share with the _gandhabba_ the attributes of being divine musicians, sometimes half-horse (or later, half-bird), and being sensual lovers; but where the _gandhabba_ is associated with licentiousness, the _kinnara_ and _kinnarī_ live together as a perfect dyad of lovers, ever entranced with one another. They are spirits of nature, hidden in the mountains, and threatened by human encroachment ([ja485](). Occasionally, however, a human tribe in the mountains of Kashmir is called Kinnara (= Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh?). | The beauty of the pixie’s eyes are praised at [ja458:1.3](), while the phrase “captivating eyes” (_mandalocana_) is used of a divine maiden at [dn21:1.5.26]().
