  "ja77:1.1": "King Pasenadi is perturbed by sixteen dreams, but the Buddha assures him that these do not affect him, but are portents of times to come. Each dream depicts an inversion or perversion of the just order of things. | Four snorting black bulls depart without fighting. | Sapling trees flower. | Cows suckle at newborn calves. | Oxen are unyoked and calves given the reins.

  "ja77:1.2": "A horse eats from two mouths. | People beg a jackal to defecate in a fine goblet. | A she-jackal eats a rope as it is being spun. | People pour water into a full pitcher. ",
  "ja77:1.3": "A lotus-pond is muddy in the middle and clear on the edges. | Rice will not cook. | People barter sour milk for sandalwood. ",
  "ja77:2.2": "Text reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>supaṇṇa</i> (“phoenix”), but commentary reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>suvaṇṇa</i> (“golden”), explaining as “golden royal geese” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>suvaṇṇarājahaṁsa</i>). ",
  "ja77:2.3": "The verse has seven lines, with each pair of lines having a different metre: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>opacchandasaka</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vetālīya</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tuṭṭhubha</i> for the last three. ",
  "ja77:2.4": "This sentence is a prose addendum. It seems to be an affirmation for someone suffering bad dreams: they remind themselves that the perverse, upside-down things they saw in the dream are not real. "
