  "ud1.8:6.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Atthiko</i> is tricky to translate due to the vagueness of the base term. Ānandajoti has “need”, while Ṭhānissaro has “care about”. But it is usually used in the sense of “want”, as a synonym of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gavesī</i>, etc., or one who desires a kingdom. ",
  "ud1.8:6.5": "For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vippakāraṁ</i>, Ānandajoti has “bad manners”, while Ṭhānissaro has “misbehaving”. Neither of these seems justified. PTS dictionary gives only commentarial citations for this word, but it also occurs at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr15/en/brahmali#37.7'>Pvr 15:37.7</a>, where it is defined as changes in posture. It seems the Buddha merely observed that the former wife had changed her mind and gone back. Otherwise, the sutta passes no judgment on her behavior. "
