  "ud1.5:1.3": "A similar list of great disciples is found in the prelude to the Ānāpānassatisutta at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn118/en/sujato#1.3'>MN 118:1.3</a>. The only difference is that there the final person is Ānanda rather than Nanda. It is tempting to follow the BJT and PTS in reading Ānanda here as well, but the purpose of this Sutta is to extol all these monks as “brahmins”, which the Sutta itself explains as meaning “with fetters ended”, namely arahants. But at this time, Ānanda was still a stream-enterer (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.13.2'>DN 16:5.13.2</a>), and would only attain arahantship after the Buddha’s passing away (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/sujato#1.6.1'>Kd 21:1.6.1</a>). Nanda, on the other hand, was indeed an arahant (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud3.2/en/sujato#14.3'>Ud 3.2:14.3</a>). "
