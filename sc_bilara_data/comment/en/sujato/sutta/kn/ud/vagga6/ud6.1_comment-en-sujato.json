  "ud6.1:3.2": "Normally <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kappa</i> as a period of time means “eon”, but the late canonical texts Kathāvatthu (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/kv11.5'>Kv 11.5</a>) and Milindapañha (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mil5.1.10'>Mil 5.1.10</a>) argue that it means the “lifespan”, an interpretation followed by the commentaries. Support for this comes from <a href='/dn26/en/sujato#28.3'>DN 26:28.3</a>, which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kappa</i>. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years (<a href='/dn14/en/sujato#1.7.7'>DN 14:1.7.7</a>). We can resolve the problem if we read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kappa</i> here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years. ",
  "ud6.1:17.1": "For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in <em>Connected Discourses of the Buddha</em>, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sambhava</i> means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected. ",
  "ud6.1:17.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhavasaṅkhāra</i> here is equivalent to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyusaṅkhāra</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jīvitasaṅkhāra</i>. ",
  "ud6.1:17.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Attasambhava</i> here refers back to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sambhava</i> in the first line. "
