  "snp3.4:5.3": "Norman and Bodhi follow the commentary’s _manussehi_ (“humans”).

  "snp3.4:7.3": "The Buddha is demonstrating his expertise. The verse here called Sāvittī (Samskrit Sāvitrī) may be recited in Gāyatrī or Anuṣṭubh metres. The form specified here is the Gāyatrī, which is the form recommended for the initiation of a student in Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 11.5.4.13 (see also Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.14), and probably represents the lineage in which Siddhattha practiced under his former teachers. ",
  "snp3.4:11.2": "Norman and Bodhi both have “approach and ask”, but _upasaṅkamma_ is absolutive: he is already there. ",
  "snp3.4:14.2": "The line puns _jāti_ (“birth”) with _jāyati_ (“give birth”) and _jātaveda_ (“born knowledge”?), a poetic word for fire. "
