  "snp3.9:3.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vattasampanno</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vṛttasaṃpanna</i>) means “one of good conduct¸one who has fulfilled their duties” rather than having a technical sense of fulfilling religious observances or rites. For example, Manusmṛti 8.179 advises that one should deposit money with someone who is “of good conduct, knows the law, and speaks the truth” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vṛttasampanne dharmajñe satyavādini</i>.

  "snp3.9:11.1": "The Buddha as “eye” evokes the common (eg. Rig Veda 1.164.14, 5.40.8, 5.59.5, 10.10.9) Vedic image of the Sun as the “eye of all” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>viśvacakṣāḥ</i>, 7.63.1), the “eye” for “eyes to see” (10.158.4), moving as an unaging wheel through the sky (1.164.14).
