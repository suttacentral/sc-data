  "snp4.8:1.3": "Norman has “good” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subha</i>, Bodhi “excellent”, but the Niddesa shows that the sense is “illuminating, bringing wisdom”. The same phrase occurs at <a href='/snp4.13/en/sujato#16.3'>Snp 4.13:16.3</a>. Perhaps these are ascetics who rely on the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subhavimutti</i>, the “beautiful release” (of jhānas). But compare the “ultimate splendor” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paramo vaṇṇo</i>) propounded by the wanderer Sakuludāyī, which seems to have just an idea without any real basis ([mn79:9.3]). ",
  "snp4.8:1.4": "Here, as at <a href='/snp4.12/en/sujato#15.3'>Snp 4.12:15.3</a>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puthu</i> emphasizes how they all have their own distinct view. ",

It seems to be an idiom for “issuing a challenge”. In any case, it has a stronger sense than just “met, encountered”. ",

Oddly, most translators (Bodhi, Norman, Ñāṇadīpa, Ṭhānissaro) don’t catch this sense. "
