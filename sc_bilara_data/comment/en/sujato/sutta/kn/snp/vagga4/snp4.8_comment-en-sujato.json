  "snp4.8:1.3": "Norman has “good” for _subha_, Bodhi “excellent”, but the Niddesa shows that the sense is “illuminating, bringing wisdom”. Compare the same phrase at [snp4.13:16.3](), where the context shows we are speaking of those whose doctrine is derived from meditative experience. Perhaps here (as in the Pārāyanavagga) we are dealing with ascetics who rely on the _subhavimutti_, the “beautiful release” (of jhānas). ",
  "snp4.8:1.4": "Here, as at [snp4.12:15.3](), _puthu_ emphasizes how they all have their own distinct view. ",
  "snp4.8:2.2": "_Dahanti_ is to “regard” or “see”, per Niddesa and Commentary; Bodhi’s “accuse” seems hard to justify. ",
  "snp4.8:11.3": "Here, _yuga_ is connected in the Niddesa with _yugaggāha_ (“taking the reins”), which in turn is connected in [vb17:75.2]() with “causing disputes”. It seems to be an idiom for “issuing a challenge”. In any case, it has a stronger sense than just “met, encountered”. ",
  "snp4.8:11.4": "_Sakkhasi_ is 2nd future, _sampayātave_ is infinitive. _Sampāyati_ is a fairly common word, “answer a question”, usually in a negative sense, to be “stumped” by a question. Oddly, most translators (Bodhi, Norman, Ñāṇadīpa, Thanissaro) don’t catch this sense. "
