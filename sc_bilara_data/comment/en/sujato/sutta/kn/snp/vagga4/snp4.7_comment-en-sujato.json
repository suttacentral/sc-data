  "snp4.7:7.4": "Bodhi follows the commentary and Niddesa in rendering _parikissati_ as “afflicted”, as does Norman with “troubled”, both assuming a contracted _parikilissati_. But _parikissati_ here is connected with wisdom (or lack thereof), not suffering. Surely we should look to such passages as [an4.186:2.6](), where _parikassati_ is the mind that “drags” a person around. _Parikissati_ is the passive form. ",
