As Bodhi remarks, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aroga</i> (“healthy”) refers to the “self”, which is frequently described as the subtle body that survives death (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.38.3'>DN 1:2.38.3</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpī attā hoti arogo</i>). Here, however, what is “seen” is the soul as a physical body manifesting purity and wellness, as in the case of Māgaṇḍiya (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/sujato#19.15'>MN 75:19.15</a>). ",
  "snp4.4:1.3": "Here as in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp4.3/en/sujato'>Snp 4.3</a>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ñāṇa</i> is used in the sense of “notion”. Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa all follow Niddesa in taking <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhijāna</i> in its usual sense of “understanding, direct knowing”. But here the secondary sense of “recall” fits better. Someone thinking about their vision of a holy man believes that there must be an observer of such purity, i.e. a self. ",
