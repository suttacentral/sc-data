  "snp4.11:3.4": "_Samparāya_ means “in the next life”. The Niddesa’s gloss of “refuge, shelter” etc. is not meant to change this but to qualify it: people look for safety in the next life. ",
  "snp4.11:7.2": "Here _dvaya_ obviously refers back to the pair of the previous lines and should not be overinterpreted as “duality”. ",
  "snp4.11:12.1": "The past participle _sameta_ here should be read, as per Niddesa, similarly to _paṭipanna_, i.e. “engaged in the practice” rather than “completed the practice”. ",
  "snp4.11:13.1": "Following Niddesa. ",
  "snp4.11:13.2": "From the following verses we can infer that these enigmatic lines refer to an advanced state of _samādhi_, probably the formless attainments. These are not “normal” as they have no sense-perception or defilements; they are not “distorted” as they are free of hindrances; they are not the non-percipient realm; and they do not perceive what has disappeared, namely the _rūpa_ or the _sukha_ of lower absorptions. ",
  "snp4.11:13.4": "In [mn18](), we have the sequence perception, thought, proliferation, then _papañcasaññāsaṅkhā_. This suggests that _papañca_ causes _saṅkhā_, as per Bodhi. ",
  "snp4.11:14.1": "Oddly, however, the disappearance of _sukha_ and _dukkha_ is not directly answered. It is, however, implied in the surmounting of 3rd _jhāna_. ",
  "snp4.11:15.1": "Such as the Buddha’s former teachers, who aimed at rebirth in formless realms. See [an10.29:20.1](). ",
  "snp4.11:15.3": "How to distinguish this from the Buddha’s teaching? If, following Bodhi, we read _samaya_ as “attainment”, we must add in an extra layer of interpretation. If we follow Norman in accepting the (more common) sense of “time, occasion”, then the difference becomes clear: they believe that the end of things happens at some point in the future (probably at death), rather than the Buddha who spoke of realizing the truth now.
