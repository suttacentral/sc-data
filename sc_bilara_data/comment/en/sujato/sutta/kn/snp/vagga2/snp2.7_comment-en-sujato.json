  "snp2.7:16.4": "_Kiccākicca_ means “all kinds of duties, various business”, not “what is to be done and not done” (per both Norman and Bodhi). See eg. [thag16.10:20.2]().",
  "snp2.7:18.4": "A line elsewhere only used to describe hell. Perhaps the Buddha was no fan of the suburbs.",
  "snp2.7:20.1": "I’m not entirely convinced that _ganthetvā_ means “composed” here. It’s the only early usage in this sense, and the reading is derived from the highly polemical commentary. It may mean just that they “put together” i.e. “selected” favorable passages. This would be less nasty to the brahmins and more historically plausible (as we know that the Vedas are, in fact, old.)",
  "snp2.7:26.3": "No doubt an exaggeration, but [sacrifices on this scale have been performed in modern times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadhimai_festival)."
