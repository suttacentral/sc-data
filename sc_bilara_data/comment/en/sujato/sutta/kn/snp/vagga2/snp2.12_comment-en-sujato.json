  "snp2.12:10.3": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kāmakāro</i>: “wish-maker”. At [kv23.3]() <i lang='pi' translate='no'>issariyakāmakārikā</i> means a “sovereign act of will”. Commentary here says ordinary people may not simply know or say what they want.",
  "snp2.12:10.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṅkheyyakāro</i>: “comprehensibility-maker”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṅkheyya</i> is always used in the sense of “calculable, comprehensible”, not “after comprehension”. The point, in line with the previous and succeeding verses, is that the Buddha explains things in a way that makes them clear. It’s a clever pair of lines, best served by sticking close to the literal form."
