  "snp1.1:7.1": "Both Bodhi and Norman implicitly accept the commentarial reading here, i.e. that this refers to “wrong thoughts”. However the identical line at [ud6.7:4.1]() clearly refers to jhāna. Both also follow the commentary in reading _vidhūpitā_ as “burning up”, but _vidhūpa_ refers to clearing the mist, smoke, or incense. ",
  "snp1.1:9.2": "Bodhi, Norman, and Thanissaro all render _vitatha_ as “unreal”. Normally it’s used in the context of “true” speech or the “reality” or “unerringness” of say dependent origination. To say the whole world is “unreal” seems overly idealistic for early Buddhism, so I translate in accord with the apparent sense."
