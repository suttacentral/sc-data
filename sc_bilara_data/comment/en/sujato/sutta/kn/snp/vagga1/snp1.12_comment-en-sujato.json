  "snp1.12:3.1": "The commentary, followed by Norman, Bodhi, and Ñāṇadīpa, all take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pamāya</i> here in the sense of “crushed” (Sanskrit: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pramṛṇati</i>). However, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pamāya</i> occurs at [snp4.12:17.1](), where, being beside <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vinicchaye</i> (“judge, assess”), it is clearly an absolutive of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pamiṇāti</i> “having measured”. Here too it sits beside a word (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅkhāya</i>) having the sense to reckon or calculate. In the simile of rebirth and the field, the “seed” is consciousness, which belonging to the first noble truth is not “crushed” but “fully known”. If the seeds are already “crushed” then choosing not to water them (in the next line) is a tad redundant.",
  "snp1.12:3.4": "Compare the stock idiom <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Saṅkhampi na upeti upanidhimpi na upeti kalabhāgampi na upeti</i> at eg. [sn20.2:1.7](); also [snp5.7:6.3]()."
