  "snp1.8:5.3": "For “have become or will be” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhūtā va sambhavesī va</i>) I follow Norman and Bodhi in reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sambhavesī</i> as a future active participle. Compare such Sanskrit constructions as Rig Veda 1.66.8, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yamo ha jāto yamo janitvaṁ</i> (“the twin that is born and the twin about to be born”) and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.3.1.24, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhūtaṁ caiva bhaviṣyacca jātaṁ ca janiṣyamāṇaṁ</i> (“has become and will be, born and to be born”). ",
  "snp1.8:6.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Nikujjati</i> means to “turn upside down”, such as when the Sangha in extreme circumstances may “upturn the bowl” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pattaṁ nikujjati</i>). Most translators follow the commentary here (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vañceyya</i>, “trick, deceive”). However Ñāṇamoḷi has “work another’s undoing”. I think the sense is that one should not turn away from or avert one’s gaze from another. ",
  "snp1.8:10.4": "Note that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jātu</i> here is not connected to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jāti</i> “birth”. Rather, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>na hi jātu</i> is an idiom meaning “never”. Commentary: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ekaṃseneva</i>. "
