It seems he was an acolyte of the Kosalan brahmins such as Āḷāra Kālāma who taught the state of nothingsness as the highest realization, and wanted to find a secluded place to pursue his meditations (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#15.1'>MN 26:15.1</a>). The sense of “owning nothing” is also relevant. ",

  "snp5.1:2.3": "This is the only early occurrence of this famed sacred river of the south. It arises near Nashik, Maharashtra, not far from Mumbai on the west coast, and flows east for 1,465 kilometres before emptying in the Bay of Bengal. The name <i lang='pi' translate='no'>godāvarī</i> means “granter of cows” due to the abundance the river brings to the lands through which it flows. The town at its source was called Govardhana, “cow-prosperity”. Normally spelled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>godhāvarī</i> in Pali, the form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>godāvarī</i> is standard in Sanskrit, including Buddhist texts (eg. Mahāvastu 3.363) and it seems the Pali spelling is an error. ",
  "snp5.1:8.4": "The threat of losing one’s head is found at eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.8.6 and Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3.24, or at 3.9.26 when it actually did fall off. I cannot trace the detail of heads being split in seven to any early Sanskrit texts, but it is found in later texts such as Rāmāyaṇa 7.26.44c and Mahābhārata 14.7.2c. ",

  "snp5.1:15.2": "Note that, in the EBTs, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pathavimaṇḍala</i> primarily refers to the region ruled by a Wheel-Turning Monarch. Thus it doesn’t mean “circle” in the sense of “the circle of the earth” but rather a “sphere of influence”, i.e. “territory”. ",
  "snp5.1:16.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Purā</i> can be either “from the city” (Norman), or “formerly” (commentary, followed by Bodhi and Jayawickrama). I think the poet is deliberately echoing the opening line of the text, where it must mean “from the city”. ",
  "snp5.1:17.4": "“He is the one of clear eye regarding all things.” ",
  "snp5.1:21.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Mandira</i> is unusual and probably a sign of lateness. Bodhi has “realm”, Norman “city”, but the normal meaning in Sanskrit is a “dwelling place”, and in the Jātakas it is always used in the sense of a home. ",
  "snp5.1:21.3": "The commentary gives the senses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vigatadhuro</i> “free of burden” (followed by Norman) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>appaṭimo</i> “unrivalled” (followed by Bodhi), but at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.20/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 3.20:2.1</a> it has the sense “indefatigable” and there seems no reason why it shouldn’t have the same meaning here.
