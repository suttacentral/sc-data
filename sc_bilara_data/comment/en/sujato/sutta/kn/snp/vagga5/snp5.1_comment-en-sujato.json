  "snp5.1:11.2": "Her gender is indicated below. ",
  "snp5.1:15.2": "Note that, in the EBTs, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pathavimaṇḍala</i> primarily refers to the region ruled by a Wheel-Turning Monarch. Thus it doesn’t mean “circle” in the sense of “the circle of the earth” but rather a “sphere of influence”, i.e. “territory”. ",
  "snp5.1:16.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Purā</i> can be either “from the city” (Norman), or “formerly” (commentary, followed by Bodhi and Jayawickrama). I think the poet is deliberately echoing the opening line of the text, where it must mean “from the city”. ",
  "snp5.1:21.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Mandira</i> is unusual and probably a sign of lateness. Bodhi has “realm”, Norman “city”, but the normal meaning in Sanskrit is a “dwelling place”, and in the Jātakas it is always used in the sense of a home. ",
  "snp5.1:21.3": "The commentary gives the senses <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vigatadhuro</i> “free of burden” (followed by Norman) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>appaṭimo</i> “unrivalled” (followed by Bodhi), but at <a href='/an3.20/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 3.20:2.1</a> it has the sense “indefatigable” and there seems no reason why it shouldn’t have the same meaning here.

  "snp5.1:34.4": "One of the many signs of lateness in this passage. ",
  "snp5.1:36.2": "Bodhi accepts the reading “former” but, given that there seems no evidence that the name was abandoned at this time, this seems unlikely. ",
  "snp5.1:37.3": "Bodhi and Norman have Setavya, but <a href='/dn23/en/sujato'>DN 23</a> shows it is feminine. ",
  "snp5.1:37.4": "See my remarks on <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mandira</i> above. Kusinārā was famously <em>not</em> a city, contra Bodhi and Norman. "
