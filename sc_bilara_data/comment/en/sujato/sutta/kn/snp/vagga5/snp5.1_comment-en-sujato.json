  "snp5.1:1.3": "_Ākiñcaññaṁ_ could mean either “owning nothing” (per commentary, followed by Norman) or the “dimension of nothingness” (suggested by Bodhi). Given that just a little below we hear of him performing an expensive sacrifice; and further, that the dimension of nothingness is an important part of the conversation with of his students Upasīva and Posāla, the latter seems more likely. Anyway, “aspiring to own nothing” is hardly a noteworthy trait among ascetics.",
  "snp5.1:11.2": "Her gender is indicated below.",
  "snp5.1:15.2": "Note that, in the EBTs, _pathavimaṇḍala_ primarily refers to the region ruled by a Wheel-Turning Monarch. Thus it doesn’t mean “circle” in the sense of “the circle of the earth” but rather a “sphere of influence”, i.e. “territory”. ",
  "snp5.1:16.1": "_Purā_ can be either “from the city” (Norman), or “formerly” (commentary, followed by Bodhi and Jayawickrama). I think the poet is deliberately echoing the opening line of the text, where it must mean “from the city”. ",
  "snp5.1:21.1": "_Mandira_ is unusual and probably a sign of lateness. Bodhi has “realm”, Norman “city”, but the normal meaning in Sanskrit is a “dwelling place”, and in the Jātakas it is always used in the sense of a home.",
  "snp5.1:21.3": "The commentary gives the senses _vigatadhuro_ “free of burden” (followed by Norman) and _appaṭimo_ “unrivalled” (followed by Bodhi), but at an3.20:2.1 it has the sense “indefatigable” and there seems no reason why it shouldn’t have the same meaning here.",
  "snp5.1:34.3": "Bodhi omits _dhīrā_.",
  "snp5.1:34.4": "One of the many signs of lateness in this passage. ",
  "snp5.1:36.2": "Bodhi accepts the reading “former” but, given that there seems no evidence that the name was abandoned at this time, this seems unlikely.",
  "snp5.1:37.3": "Bodhi and Norman have Setavya, but dn23 shows it is feminine.",
  "snp5.1:37.4": "See my remarks on _mandira_ above. Kusinārā was famously *not* a city, contra Bodhi and Norman."
