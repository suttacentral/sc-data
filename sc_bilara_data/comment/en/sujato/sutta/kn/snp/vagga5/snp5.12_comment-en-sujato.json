  "snp5.12:1.4": "While the exact sense of the unique term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sahajanetta</i> is open to interpretation, surely Norman’s “omniscient one” (following Niddesa) is not right. ",
  "snp5.12:2.1": "The following line lacks a verb, and Norman, Bodhi, and Ñāṇadīpa all construe it with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhibhuyya</i>: the sun “overcomes” the earth. But that doesn’t make sense. Rather, the idiom <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhibhuyya iriyati</i> leans on <i lang='pi' translate='no'>irayati</i> in the sense “to keep going, to proceed”. The Buddha “proceeds” (i.e. keeps living) after mastering desires, like the sun “proceeds” shedding light on the earth. ",
  "snp5.12:3.1": "Niddesa, followed by Bodhi, Norman, and Ñāṇadīpa, takes <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vinaya</i> as optative. But where the same phrase occurs at <a href='/kp9/en/sujato#10.3'>Kp 9:10.3</a> and <a href='/snp1.8/en/sujato#10.3'>Snp 1.8:10.3</a> it is clearly absolutive. Moreover, the next includes the absolutive <i lang='pi' translate='no'>daṭṭhu</i>, which elsewhere follows a similar line with an absolutive verb: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāmesvādīnavaṁ disvā</i>. ",
  "snp5.12:3.4": "As in the Aṭṭhakavagga, it is essential that this phrase be rendered in an active present tense. It is not that nothing <em>has ever</em> been taken up or put down, but that they are no longer actively engaging in taking up and putting down. "
