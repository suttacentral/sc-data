There was a port on the Ganges extending over a league, split half and half between Magadha and Vajjī. Valuable products were sourced from a mountain and brought down for trade, but the Vajjians kept absconding with the whole lot.

More than a simple interlocutor, Ānanda shapes the story as its second lead, a relatable character with an empathetic point of view.

The Videhans of Mithilā are sometimes included, but several sources indicate that they remained an independent, if reduced, kingdom until they were conquered by Magadha some years later. The Mallas of Pāvā and Kusinārā formed a closely allied independent republic ([mn35:12.8]()). ",
  "dn16:1.4.9": "The “ancient Vajjian traditions” (_porāṇe vajjidhamme_) would have been established with the founding of the Vajjian republic some centuries earlier, which ensured that the members of the federation would have a voice in the Licchavi-dominated union. Compare with the “ancient traditions of the brahmins” (_porāṇā brāhmaṇadhammā_ at [an5.191]() and [snp2.7]()), the falling away from which is said to be the cause of Brahmanical decline.

As the city became well known and its identity as a village receded, it must have become known as the “city of the Pāṭaliputtas” and hence simply Pāṭaliputta. The commentary explains that _puṭabhedanaṁ_ refers to the “opening of packages”, signifying that it was a center of trade. ",
  "dn16:1.28.9": "Excavations reveal that Pāṭaliputta was constructed of wood, so the danger of fire was real.

Support for this comes from [dn26:28.3](), which says that “long life” for a mendicant is the four bases of psychic power which enable you to remain for the _kappa_. Here it is surely talking about a full lifespan. Underlying this is the idea that in different epochs the “proper lifespan” varies; in the Buddha’s day it was one hundred years ([dn14:1.7.7]()). We can resolve the problem if we read _kappa_ here, not as a period of time, but as “proper, fitting”, i.e. the “proper” lifespan of a hundred years. ",
  "dn16:3.4.3": "Here Ānanda’s mind is “as if” possessed (_yathā_), but in the Vinaya _yathā_ is missing: he is possessed ([Kd 21:1.10.17](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#1.10.17)). Remember, Ānanda is telling this story about himself. ",
  "dn16:3.7.1": "Māra is the Buddhist deity of death, sex, and delusion; his aim is to trap beings in transmigration. He appears in many guises, both real and metaphorical, throughout the canon, but this sequence is his only direct appearance in the Dīghanikāya. Here he feigns compassion, urging the Buddha to find his final peace; but he has an ulterior motive, for with the Buddha’s passing Māra’s job will be much easier. ",
  "dn16:3.7.2": "_Parinibbāna_ means “extinguishment, quenching” as of a flame. Here it appears as both noun (“extinguishment”) and verb (“become extinguished”). It is not a particularly difficult term to translate. Linguistically it has nothing to do with “attachment”, so renderings such as “unbinding” are untenable. It should be translated rather than just keeping “Nibbāna”, not least because English resists verbifying adopted words, resulting in such constructions as “enter Nibbāna”, which reifies it in a way that the Pali does not. ",
  "dn16:3.7.4": "Māra is citing the Buddha’s words for his own purpose. The Pali tradition does not say when this encounter took place, but the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda Catuṣparisatsūtra places it shortly after the Buddha’s awakening. ",
  "dn16:3.8.4": "This passage makes it clear that it was the Buddha’s intention from the beginning to establish an order of nuns (_bhikkhunī_). ",
  "dn16:3.9.2": "This passage is the narrative inverse of the occasion when Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach ([sn6.1:5.5](), etc.). Throughout, the sutta artfully preserves a degree of narrative ambiguity. Here it almost appears as if the Buddha assents to passing away because of Māra’s request, although his intent was clear earlier. Māra’s reasoning, moreover, is based on the Buddha’s own words. ",
  "dn16:3.9.3": "It seems that at this point, the Buddha is still spending the rains in Beluva village, from he would sometimes go to nearby Vesālī for alms, or to a local shrine for meditation. He left Vesālī only after holding a meeting for all the Saṅgha, which probably signified the completion of the rains ([dn16:4.1.2]()). If this reasoning is correct—and the text is not explicit—then he made this statement during the rains retreat. If, however, this reasoning is incorrect and we are already after the rains, it could not have been long after. Thus it is probably September/October, meaning that the final extinguishment was to take place in December/January. ",
  "dn16:3.10.1": "The Cāpāla shrine is unknown outside of this context. The Udāna commentary says that it was named after the _yakkha_ who formerly lived there. Now, _cāpalla_ means “fickleness, propensity to tremble” and is from the same root as earth-“quake” (_bhumicāla_; _capala_ = _pacala_ via metathesis). It is no great leap to _cāpāla_. If this is correct, it suggests that the shrine was dedicated to an earth spirit who commanded earthquakes; a fitting setting for the events to follow. ",
  "dn16:3.10.2": "Northern India lies in the shadow of the seismically active Alpide Belt, so the occurrence of earthquakes is realistic even if the causes are not scientific. ",
  "dn16:3.10.4": "For this difficult verse, I generally follow Bhikkhu Bodhi’s long discussion in *Connected Discourses of the Buddha*, note 255 on the Mahāvagga. _Sambhava_ means “production, creation”, and here I think it refers to the prolonging of life which the Buddha had just rejected. ",
  "dn16:3.10.5": "_Bhavasaṅkhāra_ (“life force”) here is equivalent to _āyusaṅkhāra_ and _jīvitasaṅkhāra_. ",
  "dn16:3.10.7": "_Attasambhava_ (“self-creation”) refers back to _sambhava_ in the first line. ",
  "dn16:3.13.3": "So far as it goes, this is a naturalistic explanation. The “water element” has the quality of softening, while the “air element” is traditionally understood as “movement”. Thus in modern terms this means, “When underground forces disturb a region of instability.” ",
  "dn16:3.14.1": "The might of ascetics was legendary in ancient India (eg. [mn56:14.2]()). The meditation described here might be compared with the “dimensions of mastery” below ([dn16:3.25.1]()). ",
  "dn16:3.15.1": "At [dn14:1.17.7]() and [mn123:7.6]() it is, rather, the entire galaxy that trembles, perhaps indicating that the enhanced miracle is a later development. ",

  "dn16:3.18.1": "See [sn56.11:13.2](). ",
  "dn16:3.20.1": "This refers to the Buddha’s death. The Pali here uses both _nibbāna_ and _parinibbāna_. Sometimes it is said that _nibbāna_ is the attainment of arahantship, while _parinibbāna_ is the death of an arahant, but this distinction is not consistently applied in the suttas. Regarding _nibbānadhātuyā_ (“the element of extinguishment”), in Pali the case is ambiguous. It is sometimes translated “by means of” or “through”, which assumes the instrumental; but the Sanskrit is _nirvāṇadhātau_, which must be locative. ",
  "dn16:3.21.1": "As at [an8.69](). The following series of “eight things” seems arbitrarily inserted here and breaks the flow of the narrative. They are absent from the Sanskrit Sarvāstivāda text edited by Waldschmidt, which goes directly to the conversation where Ānanda realizes that the Buddha is going to die. ",
  "dn16:3.21.3": "These “assemblies” were formal deliberative meetings, not just gatherings. Thus “householders” here does not mean “lay folk” in apposition to “ascetics”; rather it means “home owners”. Some of these assemblies are depicted or alluded to in the Dīghanikāya. At [dn6:1.3](), brahmins assemble in Vesālī; while at [dn3:1.13.3](), Ambaṭṭha speaks of an assembly of Sakyans, who were aristocrats. At [dn18:12.1](), we get a glimpse of the proceedings at a meeting of the gods of the Thirty-Three. ",
  "dn16:3.22.9": "There do not appear to be any records of this happening in the early texts, although  that is perhaps to be expected. It does feel out of character for the Buddha, as normally he is very up front. The commentary says that this ruse was adopted so the Buddha could plant subtle seeds (_vāsanā_) for the future. ",
  "dn16:3.24.1": "These are another way of describing the different experiences of _jhāna_. Also at [an8.65](), [an10.29:6.1](), [dn33:3.1.142](), [dn34:2.1.160](), and [mn77:23.1](). ",
  "dn16:3.25.1": "“Perceiving form (_rūpa_) internally” refers to someone developing meditation based on an aspect of their own body, such as the breath or the parts of the body. The “visions” (_rūpā_) seen externally are the lights or other meditation phenomena that today are usually called _nimitta_. An “ugly” form is the mental image that arises in such contemplations as the parts of the body. A “beautiful” image arises from practices such as mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "dn16:3.27.1": "“Not perceiving form internally” refers to meditations such as the external elements, or the decaying of another’s body. ",
  "dn16:3.29.1": "This is the meditation where one contemplates an external color, either a prepared disk or a natural phenomena such as the sky or a flower, which eventually gives rise to a “counterpart” image. Today such meditations are called _kasiṇa_ following the Visuddhimagga, but in the early texts _kasiṇa_ means “totality” and refers rather to the state of _samādhi_ that results. ",
  "dn16:3.33.1": "Already encountered at [dn15:35.1](). ",
  "dn16:3.40.1": "Note that this is the idiom that Ānanda uses when directly quoting the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:3.40.6": "“Misdeed” is _dukkaṭaṁ_. This term is familiar as the most minor class of offences in the Vinaya. Here we see an informal use of the term as something that has been wrongly done, rather than a legal violation. It is used in a similar way by Mākassapa at the First Council, who accuses Ānanda of several misdeeds. As a legal term, _dukkaṭa_ is late; the category of offences is not found in the Vinayas of the Mahāsaṅghika group of schools, which use _vinayatikkrama_ for a similar idea. ",
  "dn16:3.41.1": "The Buddha goes on to list multiple places where he hinted to Ānanda, but the only record of such a conversation is at the Cāpāla Shrine. ",
  "dn16:3.42.1": "Apparently mentioned only here. The following group of places are all near Rājagaha, and collectively illustrate the variety of dwellings and environs enjoyed by the mendicants practicing there. ",
  "dn16:3.42.2": "A cliff from which bandits were tossed as a means of execution. ",
  "dn16:3.42.3": "The traditional site of the First Council, although not mentioned as such in the Vinaya, which simply says it was at  Rājagaha. The cave that these days is identified as the Sattapaṇṇi seems much too small. ",
  "dn16:3.42.4": "A large open area where Jains did their penances ([mn14:15.2]()) and the Buddha taught occasionally ([sn8.10]()), but it is most famous as the place the monks Godhika ([sn4.23]()) and Vakkali took their lives ([sn22.87]()). ",
  "dn16:3.42.5": "Mentioned several times in the suttas as a pleasant place to meditate, it is notable as the site of the conversion of the Buddha’s chief layman disciple Anāthapiṇḍika ([sn10.8]()). But the most famous event there was when the Buddha moderated the monk Soṇa’s excessive striving ([an6.55](). ",
  "dn16:3.42.6": "The hot springs near Rājagaha were a popular place for monks to bathe, so much so that they prompted a rule ensuring that the monks did not monopolize the springs ([Bu Pc 57](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57/en/brahmali)). They are still in use and just as popular as ever. ",

  "dn16:3.42.9": "Mahākappina stayed here ([Kd 2:5.3.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#5.3.1)), and the Buddha rested there when his foot was first injured, apparently by Devadatta, before Jīvaka offered his mango grove ([sn1.38](), [sn4.13]()). ",
  "dn16:3.45.1": "The following group of places are all in the Vajjian country near Vesālī. Whereas the varied sites around Rājagaha reflect the rugged terrain there, at Vesālī all the sites are tree-shrines, as the surrounding land is flat. [dn24:1.11.5.]() indicates where they lay relative to Vesālī; the Udena shrine was to the east, and the next three to the south, west, and north respectively. ",
  "dn16:3.46.1": "Named after the local _yakkha_, to whom offerings would have been made. It could get cold enough to snow, prompting the Buddha to lay down a rule permitting three robes ([Kd 8:13.2.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#13.2.1)). A short but galaxy-shaking discourse was once taught there ([an3.125:0.3]()). ",
  "dn16:3.46.2": "The Pali has _amba_ (“mango”) and _ambaka_ (“maiden”) as variants. The commentary supports the latter, saying it was named for seven legendary princesses of Varanasi in the time of Buddha Kassapa, all of whom went on to become great disciples of our Buddha. By a strange coincidence, I made this translation on the small island of Qimei off the south coast of Taiwan, where there is a shrine to the “seven maidens” who gave the island its name. Stories of “seven maidens” are widespread in myth and folklore all over the world, including Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. The archetype descends from the constellation known in English as Pleiades and in Sanskrit as Kṛttikā. Since there are six main visible stars in the cluster today, the stories often tell of how the youngest of the seven sisters was lost. In the Buddhist telling this is Visākhā, the only sister not to become an arahant in this life. ",
  "dn16:3.46.3": "This was, obviously, a fertility shrine. ",
  "dn16:3.46.4": "Previously mentioned as the place where the seven principles of non-decline were taught to the Licchavis. The meaning of Sārandada is obscure, but the commentary says it was taken over from an old shrine to a _yakkha_ of that name. I suspect, however, that _sāra_ here is to be connected with Sanskrit _sarpa_ (normally _sappa_ in Pali), making this a shrine of “snake-offerings” (_sāran-dada_), a popular practice in India to this day under the name _sarpabali_. ",
  "dn16:3.48.7": "“Take back” is _paccāvamissati_, which has several variants. It occurs in [ja69]() and [ja509](), where it is the opposite of _vamati_, to “expel, vomit”. ",
  "dn16:3.48.8": "This was the major Saṅgha residence near Vesālī. The Great Wood, according to the commentary, stretched as far as the Himalayas. Later tradition says that a town should have three woods: a “great wood” for wilderness (_mahāvana_); a “prosperity wood” for resources (_sirivana_); and an “ascetic wood” for spiritual practice (_tapovana_).

  "dn16:3.50.3": "Memorization was considered an essential basis for learning. In similar passages, we also find the injunction to “recite” the teachings, thus authorizing the recitation of the Buddha’s teachings after his death, which was later formalized in the Councils (_saṅgīti_). ",
  "dn16:3.50.5": "These are the sets of practices later called the 37 _bodhiyapakkhiyā dhammā, the “wings to awakening”. Here they are presented as an essential summary of the Buddha’s teachings. They form the backbone of the final book of the Saṁyuttanikāya, the Maggavagga (or Mahāvagga). It is likely that the Buddha was referring to the earliest recension of this text. ",
  "dn16:3.51.4": "This is perhaps the briefest summary possible of the Buddha’s teaching. The world as it is, and all the beings in it, are created and sustained through conditions. Since the conditions that sustain them are finite, the conditioned phenomena are also finite and must come to an end. Reflecting on this gives rise to gratitude for the life we have and the opportunities it grants us, and determination to live and practice dedicated to the realization of the unconditioned, Nibbana.

There is a nuance in meaning here, because while _apalokana_ literally means to “look back”, it is used in the sense to “take leave” before setting out on a journey. ",
  "dn16:4.1.4": "_Bhaṇḍagāma_, where _bhaṇḍa_ means “wares”; it must have been a trading post. It seems the villages in this passage were named after their chief economic activity, so I translate them to highlight this pragmatic system. ",

They are more frequent in the Vinaya, being used as a general qualifier of a legitimate legal procedure ([Bu Pc 63:2.1.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63/en/brahmali#2.1.8)). Due to this, the fact that there are three items, and the fact that _dhamma_ and _sutta_ are different words, we should not take _dhamma_ and _vinaya_ here as equivalent to _sutta_ and _vinaya_ below. Rather, they are a general claim to authenticity and do not specify particular texts. ",

  "dn16:4.8.5": "It is tempting to assume that _sutta_ here means the Suttapiṭaka and _vinaya_ means the Vinayapiṭaka, or at least an earlier version of these texts; but this is not supported by tradition. The late canonical Netti explains _sutta_ as “the four noble truths” and _vinaya_ as “the removal of greed, hate, and delusion” ([ne6]()). The commentaries discuss many interpretations; ultimately they agree with the Netti for _vinaya_, but say _sutta_ means the entire Tipiṭaka. I think the Netti is correct: teachings should “fit in” with the four noble truths (like other footprints fit in to an elephant’s footprint, [mn28]()), and they should “be exhibited” in that the results of practice should be apparent (_sandiṭṭhika_). “Memorize” (_uggahetvā_), because in an oral tradition a text is not learned until it is known by heart; such claims must be taken seriously. For _osāreti_ read _otāreti_ per [an4.180](). ",
  "dn16:4.8.6": "The text has _ca_ (“and”) rather than _vā_ (“or”), which would be expected if they were to be found in one or other textual collection. This is urging that any teaching fits in with the fundamental principles of the four noble truths, and is effective in removing defilements. ",
  "dn16:4.8.13": "The Pali text appears to say that one should remember the _mahāpadesa_, whereas the Sanskrit clearly says one should remember the passage (_ayaṁ dharmo’yaṁ vinaya idaṁ śāstuḥ śāsanam iti viditvā dhārayitavyāḥ_). It seems as if this pattern should underlie the Pali too, for the passage is false, one “should reject it” (_chaḍḍeyyātha_). If the passage is correct we should expect a parallel injunction that one “should remember it” (_dhāreyyātha_). But if this applies to the _mahāpadesa_ there is no such injunction. Thus it seems as if the Sanskrit is correct here and the Pali corrupt. I restore it by reversing the order of the phrases. ",
  "dn16:4.9.2": "Each of the four references is a little less solid than the previous. Here one hasn’t heard from the Buddha, but from the Saṅgha. The fact that one hears it from the Saṅgha implies a kind of formal group recitation such as a _saṅgīti_ or “council”. ",

The “outlines” (_mātikā_, literally “matrix”) are the summary outlines of topics that served as seeds for the development of Abhidhamma. [dn16:3.50.5]() features one of the earliest of such lists, the 37 path factors that the Buddha “taught from his own direct knowledge”.

It was, according to Buddhist texts, the place where Mahāvīra had recently died, plunging the Jains into chaos. (The Jains, however, say this was another Pāvā, east of Nāḷandā.) Pāvā became associated with especially ascetic monks: thirty Pāvā monks became awakened on hearing a particularly strong discourse ([sn15.13]()); Mahākassapa heard the news of the Buddha’s passing at Pāvā; and monks from Pāvā allied with monks of “Avanti and the south” arguing for strict Vinaya in the Second Council ([Kd 22:1.7.11](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#1.7.11)).

At [dhp377](), flowers are described as _maddava_, meaning “overripe, withering on the vine”. It is a common practice to allow meat to sit for a while to become tender and “high” for extra flavor when cooked. But this can lead to a proliferation of dangerous bacteria unless properly cooked, and such seems to have been the case here. In any case, this disputed term is marginal in a consideration of meat-eating in early Buddhism, which is discussed more fully elsewhere. ",
  "dn16:4.18.3": "If the Buddha knew the meal was dangerous, why ask to be served it?

  "dn16:5.3.10": "This kind of narrative elevation is characteristic of the Buddha’s teaching. He did not try to deny or eliminate any belief in the miraculous, or in the power of devotion, but rather to show that such things were of limited worth compared with practice. ",
  "dn16:5.4.1": "Like Cundaka above, Upavāna shares the duties of an attendant with Ānanda. At [an5.166](), Ānanda goes to Upavāna for support when he feels he has disappointed the Buddha. ",

  "dn16:5.6.7": "These two reactions—grief and equanimity—are depicted often in Buddhist art and narrative. They stimulated the two poles of development of the Buddhist community. The devotional tradition, feeling the need for an emotional connection with the Teacher, developed art, story, and doctrines to, as it were, keep him alive, resulting in the Jātakas and the Bodhisattva doctrine. A cooler, rational tradition developed a comprehensive system analyzing the impermanence of “conditions”, leading to the Abhidhamma. ",

The site is marked with an Ashokan pillar dated perhaps 150 years after this time. On the pillar is inscribed in Brahmī characters _hida bhagavaṃ jāte ti_, which is a direct quote in Māgadhī of the Pali phrase here, _idha tathāgato jāto ti_. (_Tathāgata_ “realized one” is how the Buddha referred to himself, _bhagavā_ “blessed one” how his followers referred to him.) This is the oldest direct quote from the early canon preserved in the archaeological record. ",

  "dn16:5.9.2": "As it stands, this appears to contradict [mn152:2.10](), where the Buddha ridicules the idea that sense restraint implies not seeing. The commentary, however, explains as not looking at a woman who is standing in the doorway of a monks’ hut so as not to give rise to lust. Thus it restricts this apparently general rule to an unusually intimate encounter. ",
  "dn16:5.9.3": "The verb changes from _paṭipajjāma_ (first person plural) to _paṭipajjitabbaṁ_ (future passive participle), an unusual shift that mirrors the following passage regarding the funeral proceedings. There, the shift to future passive participle indicates that the subject is the lay folk who carry out the funeral, whereas here that shift does not apply. This suggests that this passage has been composed from that template and is therefore later. ",

  "dn16:5.12.8": "For “independent Buddha”, text has _paccekasambuddho_ rather than the usual _paccekabuddho_. These are sages who discover the Dhamma and are awakened independently, but who do not themselves go on to found a dispensation or establish a monastic order. ",

The Rāmāyaṇa also tells the story of a Kusa, son of Rāma, who ruled the city of Kusāvatī, although this city was located far to the south in the Vindhya ranges. Both stories are united by the detail that _kusa_ grass, a prominent feature of Vedic ritual, ensured the kingly lineage. ",
  "dn16:5.18.3": "A “league” (_yojana_) is usually estimated at between seven and twelve kilometers. At its greatest extent under Ashoka, Pāṭaliputta was less than a league per side, so the dimensions of Kusāvatī here are strictly legendary. ",

  "dn16:6.1.5": "This is similar to the idea of the Four Great references, and sets the scene for the First Council at which the teachings were recited. _Paññatto_ here means “pointed out” rather than “laid down”, as can be seen from [dn9:33.21](), where the same phrase refers to the four noble truths.

  "dn16:6.2.1": "_Āvuso_ is from the root _āyu_ (“age”) and thus has a respectful sense and does not mean “friend” as it is often translated. Like _bhante_, it is an indeclinable vocative of address that may be used with or without the name. ",
  "dn16:6.2.3": "I render _bhante_ as “sir” when it stands alone and “honorable” when it prefixes a a name. Unlike _bhante_, _āyasmā_ (“venerable”) is declinable, so it is used in parts of speech other than direct address.
