If this reasoning is correct—and the text is not explicit—then he made this statement during the rains retreat. If, however, this reasoning is incorrect and we are already after the rains, it could not have been long after.

  "dn16:5.8.6": "The phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbānadhātuyā parinibbuto</i>, “fully quenched in the element of extinguishment” shows how the Pali uses two roots simultaneously for Nibbana.

The past participle form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbuta</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nirvṛta</i>), from the root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>var</i> (“to check or restrain”), has the basic sense of freedom from obstacles and constrictions. Generally, the Pali treats <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbuta</i> as the past participle form of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i>, and for the most part the difference is purely verbal. Yet I believe the ambiguity is deliberate, as each captures a slightly different nuance of Nibbana. “Quenched” means both to go out like a flame and to be satisfied like a thirst. This positive feel appears in Sanskrit passages using <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nirvṛta</i>, such as Manusmṛti 1.54, where it describes the blissful absorption of all beings into the great divinity. By using “extinguishment” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i> and “quenched” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbuta</i> I hope to express this subtle distinction, or at least to alert the reader that it exists.
