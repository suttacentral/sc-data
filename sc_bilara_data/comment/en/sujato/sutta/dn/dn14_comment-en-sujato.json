This is treated as a meditative contemplation, whereas the next sutta, [dn15]() Mahānidānasutta, delves into the philosophical implications. ",
  "dn14:2.18.5": "The reflection shows how the bodhisatta is still digging into the trauma of discovering the reality of old age and death. ",
  "dn14:2.18.9": "Since there cannot be an end to the “birth” that starts this life, _jāti_ in dependent origination (as often elsewhere) means “rebirth”, the next stage in the ongoing cycle. ",

  "dn14:2.18.39": "Thus far the analysis agrees with the Upaniṣads, which say that the manifold appearances in the world arise from consciousness. ",
  "dn14:2.18.43": "Here the Buddha decisively departs from the Upaniṣadic view. Consciousness is not a fundamental property of being underlying multiplicity, but rather a conditioned phenomena that arises with multiplicity. ",
  "dn14:2.19.2": "Dependent origination normally continues with two further factors: choices and ignorance, but the sequence is sometimes concluded here, as in [sn12.65](), [sn12.67](), and [dn15](). This form emphasizes the mutuality of name and form with consciousness, but does not preclude the normal linear form. Each of the presentations of dependent origination reveals a different aspect of a complex, ramified process. ",
  "dn14:2.19.4": "Note the use of repetition to sum up the main doctrinal teachings. This serves to lock the sequence in memory and ensure no items are missing or displaced, while for one who is reciting the text from memory it provides an opportunity to reflect and apply the meaning in their own experience.

  "dn14:2.19.6": "This phrasing recalls the Buddha’s first sermon ([sn56.11:5.1]()), an insight that is said to be common to all Buddhas ([sn56.12:1.1]()). _Pubbe ananussutesu_ (“not learned before from another”) means that this is a new insight that was not passed down in an oral tradition. ",
  "dn14:2.21.2": "The PTS edition has _vipassanā-maggo_ here, despite admitting the term is found in no manuscripts and is taken from the commentary, where it is clearly an explanation not a reading (_maggoti vipassanāmaggo_).

The contemplation on the aggregates dispels the mistaken assumption of a self. Many of the theorists in [dn1]() identify the self with one or other of the aggregates. ",
  "dn14:2.22.5": "_Saṅkhāra_ in early Buddhism has three main doctrinal senses. (1) The broadest sense is “conditioned phenomena”, which we find in the Dīghanikāya at [dn16:6.10.10](), [dn17:2.16.1](), and [dn34:1.8.59](). This essentially means “everything except Nibbana”. (2) Sometimes it is a physical or mental “process” or “activity” as at [dn18:24.1](), where it refers to the gradual stilling of energies in the development of meditation. (3) In the five aggregates and dependent origination it has the sense of “morally potent volitions or choices” and is a synonym for _cetanā_ (“intention”). It is defined as good, bad, and imperturbable choices ([dn33:1.10.77]()), the latter of which refers to the kamma of the fourth _jhāna_ and above. In this sense it is the moral “choices” for good or ill that propel consciousness into a new rebirth. ",
  "dn14:2.22.6": "Again, the radical thesis of the Buddha’s teaching is the idea that consciousness is merely another empirical phenomena that comes to an end, as is also emphasized in the concluding verses of [dn11](). ",

  "dn14:3.2.9": "“Veiled” is _āvuṭā_, which is from the same root as _asaṁvutā_ in [dn14:1.17.5]() above. Both terms ultimately stem from the Vedic serpent Vṛtra (“the constrictor”) who wraps the world in darkness. ",
  "dn14:3.2.10": "Had he followed this inclination he would have been a _paccekabuddha_, a Buddha “awakened for himself”. ",

  "dn14:3.6.1": "Previously he simply reflected to himself, now he uses his psychic abilities to ascertain people’s spiritual potential. ",
  "dn14:3.6.2": "_Indriya_ (“faculty”) is an abstract noun from _indra_, the name of the potent Vedic god of war. In the Vedas, Indra manifests his _indriya_ by drinking soma. The drug enables him to release his full potential and power; originally this probably referred to drinking an amphetamine-like substance before battle. Here we see that it means something like “spiritual potential” which is unleashed by the practice of the eightfold path. ",
  "dn14:3.7.14": "_Pamuñcantu saddhaṁ_ has long troubled translators, as the basic sense of _pamuñcantu_ is “release”. The problem is a long-standing one, for Sanskrit variants include _pramodantu_ (“celebrate”) or _praṇudantu kāṅkṣāḥ_ (“dispel doubts”). I think it is a poetic variant of _adhimuñcantu_, to “decide” or “commit” to faith. Pali commonly uses a synonymous verb to reinforce the sense of the noun. In [snp5.19](), _muttasaddho_, _pamuñcassu saddhaṁ_, and _adhimuttacittaṁ_ are all used in this sense. ",
  "dn14:3.8.5": "In the account of Gotama, he first thinks to teach his former colleagues under whom he practiced the formless attainments. But Vipassī, it seems, did not have such an extended sojourn among other spiritual teachers of his time. ",

  "dn14:3.9.2": "There is a clear distinction between such managed “parks” and wilderness regions (_arañña_). ",
  "dn14:3.13.1": "In the early period, there was no distinction between “going forth” (_pabbajjā_) and “ordination” (_upasampadā_). They refer to two sides of the same coin: leaving the home life and entering the ascetic life. Ordination was originally granted with the simple call, “Come mendicant!” (_ehi bhikkhu_). ",
