  "dn3:1.1.1": "This sutta marks a turning point where the Buddha’s teachings were embraced by Pokkharasādi. The suttas that follow reverberate with the consequences of this encounter. He was one of the most influential brahmins of his time, although the Buddha elsewhere denied that he had any special knowledge ([mn99:15.5]()). Brahmanical texts confirm that he was a real person, an influential teacher around the time of the Buddha known as Pauṣkarasādi in Sanskrit. He is cited on grammar by Kātyāyana and Patañjali, and in the Taittirīya-prātiśākhya; on allowable food and theft in the Āpastamba Dharmasūtra; and on Vedic ritual in the Śāṅkhāyana-Āraṇyaka. His name identifies as descended from a man of Puṣkarāvati, a city in Gandhāra. [mn99:10.3]() clarifies that he is of the Upamañña lineage. ",
  "dn3:1.1.2": "Icchānaṅgala was a center east of Sāvatthī for the innovative brahmins of the Kosala region. ",
  "dn3:1.2.1": "Ukkaṭṭhā is mentioned only rarely, and always in the context of extraordinary teachings and events that emphasize the cosmic grandeur of the Buddha against the brahmins ([dn14:3.29.1](), [mn1:1.2](), [mn49:2.1]()). At [mn99:10.3]() Pokkharasādi is said to be “of the Subhaga Forest”. | “Royal park” is _rājadāya_ (cp. _migadāya_, “deer park”). | A _brahmadeyya_ is a gift of land by a king to a brahmin, which was an outstanding feature of Indian feudalism. ",
  "dn3:1.2.8": "Pokkharasādi does not care whether the Buddha identified as a follower of the Vedas. The wise do not concern themselves with religious identity. ",
  "dn3:1.3.1": "The three Vedas had already accrued an extensive ancillary literature. That there was an advanced science of linguistics is not in doubt, for within a century or so of the Buddha, Pāṇini created the Aṣṭādhyāyī, a work of linguistics so precise and sophisticated that its methods are still being explored today. | The “testaments” (_itihāsa_) may have been early versions of the stories found in the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa. | “Cosmology” (_lokāyata_) here is a branch of Vedic learning, not the heterodox school known by this name in later times ([an9.38](), [sn12.48]()) | For “authorized as a master” (_anuññātapaṭiññāta_) see [mn98:7.1.]() and [snp3.9:6.1.](). | For “scriptural heritage of the three Vedas” (_tevijjake pāvacane_) see [mn95:12.2.](). ",
  "dn3:1.3.2": "Almost the same words are spoken to the bodhisatta by his first teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta ([mn36:14.9]()). This connects Pokkharasādi with Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, and suggests that the anointing of a talented student in this way was a regular practice of wise brahmins. ",
  "dn3:1.4.9": "Following PTS and BJT editions of the parallel phrase at [mn91:4.9](), which read _tayā_ for _tathā_. ",
  "dn3:1.5.2": "The thirty-two marks are detailed in [dn14:1.32.7](), [dn30:1.2.4](), and [mn91:9.1](). In Buddhist texts they are presented as the fulfillment of Brahmanical prophecy, but they are not found in any Brahmanical texts of the Buddha’s time. However, later astrological texts such as the Gārgīyajyotiṣa (1st century BCE?) and Bṛhatsaṃhitā (6th century CE?) contain references to many of these marks, albeit in a different context, so it seems likely the Buddhist texts are drawing on now-lost Brahmanical scriptures. | The notion of a two-fold course for a great hero—worldly success or spiritual—can be traced back as far as the epic of Gilgamesh. ",
  "dn3:1.5.3": "The idea of the wheel-turning monarch draws from the Vedic horse sacrifice, which establishes the authority of a king from sea to sea. The Buddhist telling is divested of all coarse and violent elements. The wheeled chariot gave military supremacy to the ancient Indo-Europeans, allowing them to spread from their ancient homeland north of the Black Sea. In Buddhism, the wheel, which also has solar connotations, symbolizes unstoppable power. For a legendary account of such a king, see the Mahāsudassanasutta [dn17](). ",
  "dn3:1.5.6": "The sacrificial horse on its journey across the land is protected by a hundred sons. ",
  "dn3:1.5.9": "The relation between Pokkharasādi and Ambaṭṭha is similar to that between the Buddha and his followers. They share the same understanding, but the Buddha is distinguished as the teacher. ",
  "dn3:1.6.1": "In this sutta, _māṇava_ is always applied to Ambaṭṭha, and _māṇavaka_ to the rest. It seems that the diminutive _māṇavaka_ means “young student” or perhaps “undergrad”. | There are said to be _sambahula_ students, a word that is often translated as “many”. But later we see that they all fit inside the Buddha’s hut, so the sense must be “several”. ",
  "dn3:1.7.1": "This is the practice of walking meditation. Meditators pace mindfully up and down a smooth path, keeping attention on their body. ",
  "dn3:1.7.3": "_Bho_ is a respectful term of address used by brahmins. The forms of address used in Pali are complex, and it is rarely possible to map them to modern English with any precision. ",
  "dn3:1.7.4": "The parallel passage at [mn35:7.4]() has a different phrase here. ",
  "dn3:1.8.3": "The term _kulaputta_ (literally, “son of a family”) typically refers to someone from a well-to-do or respected family, a “gentleman”. It is a gendered term which assumes the social status of men. ",
  "dn3:1.8.5": "The introduction has told us that the Buddha was staying in a forest at this time. Nonetheless, this was not a wilderness, but was developed enough to have huts with latched doors. ",
  "dn3:1.9.5": "The Buddha draws attention to Ambaṭṭha’s rude behavior. Throughout the suttas, the manner in which people greet the Buddha gives us a hint as to their attitudes and qualities. ",
  "dn3:1.10.3": "Note the racial connotations of using _kaṇha_ (“black”) as a slur. The brahmin caste hailed from the (relatively) fair-skinned Indo-Europeans who entered India from the north and held themselves above the dark-skinned natives. ",
  "dn3:1.11.2": "Ambaṭṭha is “qualified” (_vusita_) in scripture, but far from “qualified” in spiritual development. _Vusita_ is normally an expression of arahantship: _vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ_ (“the spiritual journey has been completed”). ",
  "dn3:1.12.6": "The PTS reading _rabhasa_ means “violent, aggressive”. But the commentary reads _bhassa_, explained as “speaking much”. Moreover, the story below does not demonstrate violence. ",
  "dn3:1.12.7": "Ambaṭṭha despises the Sakyans as “primitives” (_ibbha_) who do not respect Vedic culture. The word _ibbha_ (“primitive”) stems from a non-Aryan word for “elephant” (_ibha_). It originally referred to the native inhabitants who tamed elephants; see eg. Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.10. At [snp3.1:18.4]() the Buddha describes his own people as “natives” (_niketino_), those who have a long connection with the land. ",
  "dn3:1.14.2": "The Buddha’s use of _āyasmā_ is noteworthy here: he is taking a conciliatory tone. ",
  "dn3:1.15.5": "_Kaṇhāyana_ means “descendant of Kaṇha”. ",
  "dn3:1.15.6": "Normally I take _ayyaputta_ as a simple honorific, but here the sense is not that the Sakyans were the masters, but were descended from them. ",
  "dn3:1.15.7": "Okkāka (Sanskrit Ikṣvāku) was the legendary son of the first man, Manu, and the founder of the solar dynasty of Kosala. It is a Munda name, which may be associated with the introduction of cane sugar (_ikṣuḥ_) from eastern Asia, a theory endorsed by the 9th century Jain scholar Jinasena (Natubhai Shah, *Jainism, the World of Conquerors* 2004, vol. 1, pg. 15). ",
  "dn3:1.15.10": "“Teak” is _sāka_, the first of two puns on the Sakyan name. This line identifies them with their northern home in the shadow of the Himalayas, and suggests that harvesting teak was a primary source of wealth. Compare Gilgamesh, for whom Lebanese cedar was the foundation of his royal capital. ",
  "dn3:1.15.11": "“Own” is _saka_, the second pun on the Sakyan name. Incest is, of course, common among royal families for exactly the reason stated here. For _sambheda_ in the sense of “dissolving, leaking”, see [an2.9:1.5]() = [dn26:20.2](), [an5.103:6.4](), [an10.45:4.1](). ",
  "dn3:1.15.13": "For this sense of _sammati_, see [sn11.9](), [sn11.10](). ",
  "dn3:1.15.17": "This draws on both the puns above. But the commentary also explains _sakya_ here as “capable” (_samatthā, paṭibalā_) in reference to their survival against all odds, thus connecting Sakya with _sakka_ (“able”). ",
  "dn3:1.16.1": "Vedic _dāsa_ (“slave, bondservant”) refers to the “dark-wombed” (_kṛṣṇayoni_, Rig Veda 2.20.7) foes of the Aryan peoples (Rig Veda 10.22.8) who upon defeat were enslaved (Rig Veda 10.62.10). ",
  "dn3:1.16.2": "The passage wavers between treating _kaṇha_ (Sanskrit _kṛṣṇa_, i.e. Krishna) as a personal name, a description, and a word for a goblin. I try to capture this ambiguity by using variations of “black boy”. Note that the text does not say who the father was. ",
  "dn3:1.16.4": "Like Siddhattha, he spoke as soon as he was born. The boy was no common child, but had a larger destiny. His words are a dramatic contrast with Siddhattha’s words of confident proclamation, and his birth which was devoid of filth or impurity. ",
  "dn3:1.17.2": "Lineage was important to brahmins, but the Brāhmaṇa and Upaniṣad literature shows that, as here, many were more concerned with conduct and wisdom than with birth. ",
  "dn3:1.20.3": "This is a conventional threat, inherited from Vedic texts. ",
  "dn3:1.20.5": "In his rhetorical jousting with contentious brahmins, the Buddha often displayed his detailed knowledge of their doctrines. ",
  "dn3:1.21.1": "Vajirapāṇī (“lightning-bolt in hand”) only appears here and in the parallel passage at [mn35:14.1](). The commentary identifies him with Sakka. Much later, Mahayana texts adopted the name for a fierce Bodhisattva who was protector of the Dhamma. ",
  "dn3:1.23.5": "The contemptuous senses of “black boy” represent the conservative brahmanical view, presented not as endorsement, but as a rhetorical means to undermine Ambaṭṭha’s pride. The Buddha now shows how a man of a supposedly low birth rose to great spiritual eminence. ",
  "dn3:1.23.6": "“Divine Spell” is _brahmamanta_, a term of unique occurrence in Pali. In modern Hinduism it is used for a verse of praise for Brahmā, but that is not what is meant here. Kaṇha is one of several “dark hermits” who accrued mighty and lineage-busting powers in the south. ",
  "dn3:1.23.8": "The stories of the Hindu deity Krishna and the Kaṇha of this story share some details in common, while other details differ. Most of the similarities are too generic to establish any historical connection. But Krishna won the hand of his seventh wife Lakṣmaṇā, also known as Madrī, at an archery contest. This detail is too precise to be a coincidence, and proves there must be some shared basis between the two figures. ",
  "dn3:1.23.13": "This draws on the ancient belief that the king’s acts affect the natural order of things. ",
  "dn3:1.23.16": "This sequence seems to be an etiological myth explaining certain rites of kingship and succession, providing an origin story for this prayer. ",
  "dn3:1.23.17": "National prosperity is ensured through symbolic regicide. This example was omitted from Frazer’s accounts of such substitute sacrifices. Here there is a double substitution: the prince substitutes for the king, then a threat substitutes for the act of killing. This suggests that, even from the legendary perspective of this story within a story, the rite was an ancient one that had evolved through multiple stages. ",
  "dn3:1.23.18": "The use of the bare personal name for the king is unusual. ",
  "dn3:1.23.21": "“Divine punishment” is _brahmadaṇḍa_, harking back to the Divine Spell (_brahmamantra_). The Buddha had his own version of the _brahmadaṇḍa_, which was to give the silent treatment ([dn16:6.4.1]()). ",
  "dn3:1.24.10": "In [mn56:19.2]() _āvaṭa_/_anāvaṭa_ is used in reference to Upāli “shutting his gate” against the Jains and opening it for the Buddhists. In [dn17:1.23.2]() _anāvaṭa_ means “open to the public”. ",
  "dn3:1.27.4": "",
  "dn3:1.28.1": "Sanaṅkumāra (“Everyoung”) became a Hindu deity closely associated with the worship of Krishna. He first appears in the seventh chapter of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad. There he teaches the learned Nārada what lies beyond the mere surface of words (_nāma_) by giving a progressive meditation that ultimately reveals the highest Self. Thus he is a perfect foil for Ambaṭṭha. ",
  "dn3:2.1.1": "To his credit, after that thorough humiliation, Ambaṭṭha is ready to learn. ",
  "dn3:2.1.2": "Reading _anuttarāya vijjācaraṇasampadāya_ as locative, in agreement with _yattha_ below. ",
  "dn3:2.1.7": "The Buddha emphasizes that his “knowledge and conduct” rejects the notion of birth that is so essential to Brahmanism. ",
  "dn3:2.2.7": "The Pali text abbreviates the gradual training in this sutta and those that follow. The reader is expected to understand it as in [dn2](). Note, however, that the suttas sometimes have small differences in their perspective that make reconstruction tricky. ",
  "dn3:2.3.1": "In later Theravada, _apāyamukha_ refers to deeds that cause rebirth in lower realms. However this does not apply in the early texts; the acts described here are not evil. Rather, it means an “opening” (_mukha_) for “departure” (_apāya_). ",
  "dn3:2.3.4": "A common practice of pre-Buddhist hermits, who avoided the slightest harm to plants. Buddhist mendicants may also not harm plants, but they rely on alms and only eat fallen fruit in case of famine. ",
  "dn3:2.3.5": "The Buddha inverts Ambaṭṭha’s earlier claim that the other three castes only succeed in serving brahmins ([dn3:1.14.7]()). ",
  "dn3:2.3.8": "They are less strict than the previous ascetics, for they dig the soil and harm the plants. ",
  "dn3:2.4.2": "“Tradition” renders _sācariyaka_, “that which stems from one’s own teacher”. ",
  "dn3:2.5.5": "",
  "dn3:2.6.3": "This practice is not elsewhere attested in early Pali. ",
  "dn3:2.7.2": "_Ugga_ is a rare word whose root sense is “mighty”, but here it must be a noun. Given that it is a military man who consults with the king, I translate as “warrior-chief”. | _Rājañña_ is used occasionally in the suttas; it is an archaic synonym for _khattiya_. ",
  "dn3:2.7.6": "Taking this and the next as one sentence, despite the punctuation of the Mahāsaṅgīti text. ",
  "dn3:2.8.1": "The “hymns” (_mantā_) are the verses of the Rig Veda. The ten names here all correspond with Vedic authors according to the Brahmanical tradition. Note that in Sanskrit the names of the rishis are distinguished from the lineage holders, which take the patronymic. For example, Bharadvāja is the rishi, the Bhāradvājas are his descendants; Vasiṣṭha is the rishi, the Vāsiṣṭhas are his descendants. Pali texts do not make this distinction, but use the patronymic, although the two forms are not always readily distinguishable. | “Seer” is _isi_ (Sanskrit _ṛṣi_). It is of uncertain etymology, but was taken to mean that they had “seen” the Vedas (_mantradraṣṭa_) or directly “heard” them from Brahmā through divine inspiration, rather than “composing” them like ordinary authors. Here, however, the Buddha says they were “authors” (_kattāro_). The Buddha adopted _isi_ in the sense “enlightened sage”. ",
  "dn3:2.10.5": "_Veṭhakanatapassāhi_ is otherwise unattested. At [mn55:12.4]() _veṭhaka_ evidently means “collar”. In the Lokuttaravāda Bhikṣuṇī Vinaya, the brazen nun Thullānandā gets out of the water and wraps herself in a _veṭhaka_, which here seems synonymous with _paṭṭaka_, a strip of cloth. It is allowable if used to tie a basket ([Lo Bi Pn 3](https://suttacentral.net/san-lo-bi-pn3)). _Nata_ is “curve”, _passa_ is “side, flank”. Walshe has “flounces and furbelows”, Rhys Davids has “fringes and furbelows round their loins”. These are prissy descriptions of what is evidently stripper gear. ",
  "dn3:2.10.8": "The Buddha calls back to earlier in the sutta, where Ambaṭṭha drove a mare-drawn chariot ([dn3:1.6.1]()). | The verbs here (_vitudenti vitacchenti_) are elsewhere applied to the pecking and slashing of vultures, crows, or hawks ([sn19.1:3.2](), [mn54:16.2](), etc.). The Buddha was disgusted with this maltreatment of the mares. ",
  "dn3:2.10.11": "Remembering that Pokkharasādi lived in a wealthy property that was a royal endowment. Just as today, excessive wealth breeds insecurity. ",
  "dn3:2.10.14": "The Buddha has been hard on Ambaṭṭha, but he is not unfair. He invites the same level of scrutiny for himself. ",
  "dn3:2.11.1": "This transition occurs nowhere else. ",
  "dn3:2.11.3": "Finally he remembers what his teacher Pokkharasādi told him in [dn3:1.5.2](): he will know the Buddha by his marks. ",

  "dn3:2.15.2": "The diminutive ending for _paṇḍitaka_ is the same as in _samaṇaka_, which Ambaṭṭha used of the Buddha. | For _re_ (“bloody”), compare _cara pi re_ at [Bu Pc 70:1.35](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70/en/brahmali#1.35) and _he je kāḷī_ at [mn21:9.13](). Hard as the Buddha was on Ambaṭṭha, his own teacher was harder. ",
  "dn3:2.15.3": "Pokkharasādi shows his astuteness, for in many other dialogues the Buddha engaged with brahmins perfectly politely, as he does in the next sutta ([dn4]()). ",
  "dn3:2.15.4": "Illustrating the lack of restraint of even a senior brahmin teacher. ",
  "dn3:2.16.3": "Given Pokkharasādi’s mood, this was probably a diplomatic move. ",
  "dn3:2.16.4": "_Khādanīya_ and _bhojanīya_ are food categories commonly mentioned in Pali. Etymologically they stem from “hard and soft”. _Bhojanīya_ is defined in [Bu Pc 37:2.1.10](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37/en/brahmali#2.1.10) as grain, porridge, flour products, fish, and meat, thus being foods that are typically eaten cooked and “mooshed up” in with the fingers in the bowl. _Khādanīya_ is not so readily defined, being essentially everything not included in other categories. But it would have included such “crunchy” things as fruit and vegetables, which may be eaten uncooked. ",
  "dn3:2.17.6": "Pokkharasādi makes sure he hears both sides of the story. ",
  "dn3:2.17.9": "So far has Ambaṭṭha fallen from the learned sage we were introduced to at the start of the sutta. ",
  "dn3:2.17.10": "The Buddha bears no ill will. _Sukhī hotu_ is one of the most recognizable Pali phrases, but in early texts it is spoken only a few times: by the Buddha at [dn21:1.8.8]() and [snp5.1:54.1](); by Punabbasu’s Mother at [sn10.7:10.1](); and by various women at [Bu Ss 5:1.4.8](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/brahmali#1.4.8).

  "dn3:2.21.4": "This is the briefest expression of the four noble truths. ",
  "dn3:2.21.6": "This indicates that he became a stream-enterer (_sotāpanna_), the first of four stages of Awakening. Such details of personal attainment are typically found in the narrative rather than the teaching attributed to the Buddha, and hence were added by redactors at some point. They vary considerably in different versions. In this case, the parallel at DA 20 says that he became a stream-enterer and later a non-returner. T 20 said that he understood the teaching and went for refuge, and agrees that he became a non-returner before his death. ",

  "dn3:2.22.6": "When wandering for alms, mendicants would often roam randomly through the village (_sapadānacārī_). However if an invitation such as this were issued, the mendicant may visit that place for a meal. It was considered a special ascetic practice to refuse such invitations.
