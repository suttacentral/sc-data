  "dn25:1.3": "The Buddha refers to the events of this sutta at [dn8:23.2](), but apart from that Nigrodha (“Banyan”) appears to be unknown. A “wanderer” may or may not be Brahmanical, but in DN 8 Nigrodha is called _tapabrahmacārī_, which suggests he was a celibate student of a Brahmanical teacher. | The commentary describes _udumbarikā_ (“Fig”) as _devī_ (“Queen”), while DA 8 says she is a “brahmin lady”. She too does not seem to appear elsewhere. ",
  "dn25:1.4": "Sandhāna (“Conciliation”) was recognized as an eminent lay follower at ([an6.120-139:1.14]()). ",
  "dn25:5.5": "“One-eyed cow” is _gokāṇā_. ",
  "dn25:5.10": "_Orodheyyāma_ normally means “enclose, trap” like ox in a pen ([an6.60:3.1]()), but here it is glossed in the commentary as _vinandheyyāma_ (“twist around”). ",
  "dn25:7.9": "This discourse highlights the Buddha’s method of engaging with people of other religions. He is open-hearted and interested in their views. He prefers to build on common ground, but is not afraid to criticize when it is warranted. And his aim is not to win converts, but to help people be free of suffering. ",
  "dn25:7.16": "“Higher disgust of sin” renders _adhijegucche_. The idea is that people are tainted with corruption, somewhat comparable to the notion of “original sin”, although due to their own actions in the past rather than ancestral legacy. In “disgust” at that sin, they practice forms of fervent mortification (_tapas_) to burn out the corruption. ",
  "dn25:7.17": "The phrase _kathaṁ santā_ is unique; it echoes _evaṁ sante_ below. ",
  "dn25:8.4": "See the passage at [dn8:14.3]() and notes thereto. ",
  "dn25:9.2": "The Buddha shifts attention from the external practice to the psychological state that accompanies it. ",
  "dn25:10.12": "“In expectation” (_sāpekkho_): when they give up something they cannot eat, they expect to be given more suitable food. ",
  "dn25:11.12": "“Sneaks” is _attānaṁ adassayamāno_, literally, “not showing himself”. They like to hang about with lay folk, but hide the fact that they do so. ",
  "dn25:12.12": "As here, this item typically follows “wrong view”. At [an10.78:1.9]() it is said to be a bad quality of Jain ascetics. Thus being “attached to one’s own views” refers both to the subjective clinging as well as the objective incorrectness of the views. ",
  "dn25:16.3": "These closely resemble the five “restraints” (_yāma_) of Yogasūtra 2.30 and the Jain Tattvārthasūtra 7: non-harming (_ahiṁsā_), truth (_satya_), no stealing (_asteya_), celibacy (_brahmacarya_), and non-possessiveness (_aparigrahā_). | A different “fourfold restraint” is said to be a Jain practice at [dn2:29.2](). ",
  "dn25:16.5": "This extends the basic precept. The same analysis is applied to the “ten ways of performing deeds” at [an3.163](). ",
  "dn25:16.8": "_Bhāvitamāsīsati_ is unique. In this and similar contexts, the Pali tradition says _bhāvita_ (“reward”, normally “developed”) is the “five sense pleasures” as they see it (_bhāvitaṃ nāma tesaṃ saññāya pañca kāmaguṇā_; cp. [mn56]() commentary: _ettha ca bhāvitanti pañcakāmaguṇā_), explaining that this is a usage of the sectarians (Saddanīti ch. 4: _titthiyasamaye pana bhāvitoti kāmaguṇo vuccati_). ",
  "dn25:23.4": "This passage sets a powerful template for sincere engagement. ",
