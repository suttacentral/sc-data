  "dn21:1.1.1": "This discourse is quoted by name and a passage discussed at <a href='/sn22.4/en/sujato'>SN 22.4</a>. A Sanskrit parallel published by Ernst Waldschmidt in 1979 is available on SuttaCentral as <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sf241/san/waldschmidt'>SF 241</a>. A different discourse of the same name is found at <a href='/sn35.118/en/sujato'>SN 35.118</a>. This late sutta exhibits considerable literary sophistication. The A-plot concerns Sakka’s rejection of his violent past and embrace of the Dhamma, while the B-plot concerns Pañcasikkha’s more modest growth from a libertine to a married man. ",
  "dn21:1.1.2": "Rhys Davids follows the commentary in translating this “the cave of Indra’s Sāl Tree”. However the Sanskrit  <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yāvacchailaguhāyām</i> supports “hill cave”. ",
  "dn21:1.2.1": "Introduced in a minor role in <a href='/dn18/en/sujato'>DN 18</a>, <a href='/dn19/en/sujato'>DN 19</a>, and <a href='/dn20/en/sujato'>DN 20</a>, Pañcasikha gets his moment to shine in this sutta. Outside of the Dīghanikāya, he appears only in <a href='/sn35.119/en/sujato'>SN 35.119</a>. His name means “Fivecrest”, evidently in reference to his impressive hairdo; a nymph or group of nymphs bore the synonymous name Pañcacūḍā, “Five Topknots”. The centaur (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandhabba</i>) was a wild rogue of music, dancing, and sex. He must be tamed, and here this is achieved through the power of love and filial respect. A less diplomatic approach is taken in Atharvaveda 4.37.7, where the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharva</i> with his “egg-crest” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>śikhaṇḍino</i>) is threatened with castration. ",
  "dn21:1.2.4": "The “arched harp” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vīṇa</i>) was a multi-stringed instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Gandhabbas</i> are closely associated with music. ",
  "dn21:1.2.5": "In the Buddhist hierarchy of divinity, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandhabbas</i> occupy a more humble place than the gods of the Thirty-Three, yet here Pañcasikha appears with them in a position of honor. In <a href='/dn19/en/sujato#28.3'>DN 19:28.3</a> we saw that the even more exalted Brahmā takes the form of Pañcasikha. This fluidity is characteristic of old Vedic cosmology, where there is no clear hierarchy of divinity. The formalized Buddhist hierarchy is a later conception. ",
  "dn21:1.4.2": "We will learn later of how Sakka’s appearance could be too disturbing for the Buddha while on retreat. Pañcasikha, on the other hand, would appear alone, without a retinue. ",
  "dn21:1.4.8": "The idea that the Buddha would be wooed by a love song seems like an absurd conceit, until you take into account the centaurs’ dangerous reputation as inveterate lechers. Pañcasikha wants to show that he is maturing and finally seeking a commitment in a respectable marriage. ",
  "dn21:1.5.1": "Suriyavaccasā (“Sunshine”) reflects the solar dimension of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandhabba</i> mytheme. She appears in Atharvaveda 8.10.27, which invokes the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharvas</i> with their female counterpart the “nymphs” (Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>accharā</i>, Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āpsarásā</i>). ",
  "dn21:1.5.2": "In Sanskrit literature, Timbaru (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tumburu</i>) was an elder <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharva</i> musician in the courts of Indra and Kuvera. According to Rāmāyaṇa 3.4, he was cursed with a monstrous form by Kuvera due to an inappropriate lust for the nymph Rambhā. Upon his defeat at the hands of Rāma he was restored to his former status. Pañcasikha would have wanted to avoid a similar fate. Rather than Suriyavaccasā, the Sanskrit literature mentions his daughters Manuvantī and Sukeśī (Vāyupurāṇa 69.49 = Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 2.7.13). ",
  "dn21:1.5.7": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aṅgīrasi</i> means “shining one” and is etymologically linked with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>agni</i> (“fire”). Suriyavaccasā earned the name due to both her radiant nature and her family connections: her father Timbaru was a son of Kaśyapa, who was (according to certain lineages) brother of Aṅgīras, from whom the Aṅgīrasas were descended. In the Arthavaveda—the only early non-Buddhist source for a nymph named Suriyavaccasā—<i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṅgīrasi</i> is associated with witchcraft (Atharvaveda 12.5.52). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aṅgīrasa</i> is also a patronymic of the Buddha (<a href='/dn32/en/sujato#3.14'>DN 32:3.14</a>). ",
  "dn21:1.5.8": "“Saints” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahantā</i>, which I normally translate as “perfected ones”. ",
  "dn21:1.5.11": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Parinibbāpaya</i>, “please quench me”. Pañcasikha subverts imagery employed by the Buddha—quenching thirst, cooling breezes, extinguished flames—to erotic effect. ",
  "dn21:1.5.17": "Pañcasikha is showing off his literary skill. The same image, the elephant, illustrates opposing qualities, peaceful and violent. In these two sides of sensual desire, he reveals, unconsciously perhaps, the rapacious side of his own nature. For Pañcasikha, the elephant bursting its bonds illustrates his crazed devotion, whereas later it illustrates breaking free of desire (<a href='/dn21/en/sujato#1.12.45'>DN 21:1.12.45</a>). ",
  "dn21:1.5.36": "For how a married couple may stay together in this life and the next, see <a href='/an4.55/en/sujato'>AN 4.55</a>. ",
  "dn21:1.5.43": "Pañcasikha is using the present participle <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jigīsāno</i> in the historical present. ",
  "dn21:1.5.49": "In Indian culture, a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharva</i> wedding is a pure love-match, without the blessing of parents or priests. Here, however, Pañcasikha wants to do the right thing and get the father’s blessing. ",
  "dn21:1.6.2": "If Pañcasikha was seeking the Buddha’s approval for his love-match, he was doomed to disappointment, as the Buddha and his mendicants do not involve themselves in arranging marriages. The Buddha sidesteps the issue by politely complementing Pañcasikha on his musicianship. ",
  "dn21:1.6.7": "“Sister” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhaginī</i>) is a respectful term of address, but is normally used in a chaste sense. When Raṭṭhapāla calls his wives “sister”, they faint in shock (<a href='/mn82/en/sujato#23.4'>MN 82:23.4</a>). ",
  "dn21:1.6.8": "Sikhaṇḍī (“egg-crested”) is the term for the centaur as seductive threat to women in Atharvaveda 4.37.7. It is also a poetic term for a peacock. ",
  "dn21:1.9.3": "It is rare for the Buddha to address a deity as “venerable” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyasmā</i>), a term usually reserved for monks. Moggallāna addresses Sakka as “the venerable Kosiya” at <a href='/mn37/en/sujato#10.6'>MN 37:10.6</a>; Mahākassapa calls him Kosiya without honorific at <a href='/ud3.7/en/sujato#3.12'>Ud 3.7:3.12</a>. | The word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kosiya</i> is explained by the commentaries as “owl”, which, if correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is, however, a patronymic: Rig Veda 1.10.11 has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>indra kauśika</i> which means “Indra, son of Kuśika (or Kuśa)”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kuśa</i> grass is critical to the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially implied “Brahmanized”, i.e. a king whose reign was authorized according to Vedic ritual. ",
  "dn21:1.10.1": "A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paricārikā</i> is a maid attending on a nymph (<a href='/mn37/en/sujato#8.12'>MN 37:8.12</a>). | Bhūjati (variant <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhuñjatī</i>) does not seem to appear elsewhere. ",
  "dn21:1.10.13": "Sakka pointedly ignores this, but perhaps his shame at disturbing the Buddha’s meditation explains his oblique method of gaining an audience. ",
  "dn21:1.11.5": "This implies she was a stream-enterer. ",
  "dn21:1.11.6": "In Buddhism, sex is mutable between lives and even within one life (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#10.6.1'>Bu Pj 1:10.6.1</a>). Later Buddhists sometimes held that the status of a male was preferable. Here this is not stated outright, but the narrative implies that she thought her station was improved when becoming a male. Notably, it is not the Buddha who says this, but Sakka, relaying the story of another deity. That the proponent was a woman, at least formerly, is a trope of Indian literature: a woman is the ideal misogynist (see eg. <a href='/ja61/en/sujato'>Ja 61</a> or Śivapurāna chapter 4). Here, though, the situation is nuanced, because despite her (presumed) inferior status, she has better rebirth than the monks she served. ",
  "dn21:1.11.13": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kutomukhā</i>, which occurs only in this sutta, contrasts with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sammukhā</i> (“in the presence of”, “from the mouth of”). The commentary explains it as a rhetorical question, “Were you distracted or falling asleep?” Alternatively, it might mean “From whom did you learn the Buddha’s teaching?” It recurs later in the verses. This is not the only such case: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>duddiṭṭharūpaṁ</i> and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ</i> are other examples of terms found nowhere else in the Pali canon, yet found here both in prose and in verse. Clearly one has been copied from the other; it seems to me that the rarity of these terms and the greater coherence of the verses suggests that the prose is a (somewhat altered) summary of the verses. ",
  "dn21:1.11.19": "The commentary explains the verb “gained” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṭilabhiṁsu</i>) as serving dual roles here: “gaining” of “absorption mindfulness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānasatiṁ</i>), upon which they “gain” rebirth in the Brahmā realm. However, the verses below speak of “recollecting” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>anussaraṁ</i>) the Buddha’s teachings at this juncture. Compare <a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np23/en/brahmali#1.1.20'>Bu NP 23:1.1.20</a>, where the king “remembered” his long-forgotten promise (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vissaritvā cirena satiṁ paṭilabhitvā</i>). <a href='/an4.191/en/sujato#2.24'>AN 4.191:2.24</a> speaks of the “arising of memory” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satuppādo</i>) in a deity when reminded of Dhamma passages they once recited as a monk. | The phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāyaṁ brahmapurohitaṁ</i> is syntactically incongruous; I think it was clumsily copied from the verses below, where the required verb (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ajjhagaṁsu</i>) is present. The commentary explains it as “a Minister of Brahmā’s body” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>brahmapurohitasarīraṁ</i>), but in such contexts <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāya</i> usually means “host”. ",
  "dn21:1.12.14": "When bowing, it is a special sign of devotion to touch the feet of the one revered (eg. <a href='/mn89/en/sujato#9.1'>MN 89:9.1</a>). ",
  "dn21:1.12.19": "Here Gopaka shifts from speaking about them in third person to speaking to them in second person. ",

  "dn21:1.12.35": "Up until now, the verses have been spoken by Gopaka, but here a narrator appears. ",
  "dn21:1.12.51": "Normally rebirth is described as passing away in one realm then being reborn in another. Yet here the gods of the Thirty-Three—in their traditional abode on Mount Meru—were watching them literally fly from one realm to another. ",
  "dn21:1.12.57": "The truncated <i lang='pi' translate='no'>janind’</i> is not vocative <i lang='pi' translate='no'>janinda</i> for Sakka, but nominative <i lang='pi' translate='no'>janindo</i> for the Buddha. ",
  "dn21:1.12.58": "“Sakyan Sage” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sakyamuni</i>) became a favorite epithet of the Buddha, but in early texts it appears only here and the Ratanasutta (<a href='/snp2.1/en/sujato#4.2'>Snp 2.1:4.2</a>). ",
  "dn21:1.12.59": "“Sons” in a spiritual sense. ",
  "dn21:1.12.65": "The commentary says, “In this dispensation the explanation of the teaching is such that because of it, disciples become endowed with such qualities” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ettha sāsane evarūpā dhammappakāsanā, yāya sāvakā etehi guṇehi samannāgatā honti</i>). This explains the feminine <i lang='pi' translate='no'>etādisī</i>; <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pakasanā</i>, which is normally neuter, is feminine here. This use is fairly common in later texts (it occurs at the conclusion of the Ṭīkā for this sutta). ",
  "dn21:1.12.66": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kiṅkaṅkhati</i> is a unique term for “doubt”. ",
  "dn21:1.12.72": "The end point of Gopaka’s speech is hard to determine, as there is no <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-ti</i> to mark it. Various editions and translations either ignore the issue or end it in different places. The next line marks the beginning of Sakka’s direct speech to the Buddha, and I think it makes the best sense to assume that up to here he has been relating the story he was told. ",
  "dn21:2.1.3": "This question hints at Sakka’s own evolution from the battlegod of the Vedas to an acolyte of peace. ",
  "dn21:2.1.6": "Jealousy is wanting what others have, while stinginess is not wanting to share what you have. ",

Note the constructive use of the “yes, and” method of questioning.
