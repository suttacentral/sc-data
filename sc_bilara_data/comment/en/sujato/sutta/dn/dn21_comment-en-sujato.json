  "dn21:1.1.1": "This late sutta exhibits considerable literary sophistication. The A-plot concerns Sakka’s rejection of his violent past and embrace of the Dhamma, while the B-plot concerns Pañcasikkha’s more modest growth from a libertine to a married man. This draws on such precedents as Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.2.4.4, where the centaur is urged to win his woman by seduction rather than force. | This discourse is quoted by name and a passage discussed at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.4/en/sujato'>SN 22.4</a>. In addition, the dialogue at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato'>MN 37</a> picks up directly where this leaves off and may be considered a sequel. A Sanskrit parallel published by Ernst Waldschmidt in 1979 is available on SuttaCentral as <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sf241/san/waldschmidt'>SF 241</a>.

  "dn21:1.1.2": "Rhys Davids follows the commentary in translating this “the cave of Indra’s Sāl Tree”. However the Sanskrit  <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yāvacchailaguhāyām</i> supports “hill cave”. ",

Outside of the Dīghanikāya, he appears only in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.119/en/sujato'>SN 35.119</a>. His name means “Fivecrest”, evidently in reference to his impressive hairdo; a nymph or group of nymphs bore the synonymous name Pañcacūḍā, “Five Topknots”. The centaur (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandhabba</i>) was a wild rogue of music, dancing, and sex. He must be tamed, and here this is achieved through the power of love and filial respect. A less diplomatic approach is taken in Atharvaveda 4.37.7, where the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharva</i> with his “egg-crest” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>śikhaṇḍino</i>) is threatened with castration. ",
  "dn21:1.2.4": "The “arched harp” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vīṇa</i>) was a multi-stringed instrument held in the lap, with the strings attached across a curved open arch or bow. It is not the modern Indian instrument called veena, which is a lute or stick zither. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Gandhabbas</i> are closely associated with music (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 3.2.4). Māra’s harp is described in the same way (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn4.23/en/sujato#10.7'>SN 4.23:10.7</a>), and tradition says they were in fact the same instrument. ",
  "dn21:1.2.5": "In the Buddhist hierarchy of divinity, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandhabbas</i> occupy a more humble place than the gods of the thirty-three, yet here Pañcasikha appears with them in a position of honor. In <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn19/en/sujato#28.3'>DN 19:28.3</a> we saw that the even more exalted Brahmā takes the form of Pañcasikha. This fluidity is characteristic of old Vedic cosmology, where there is no clear hierarchy of divinity. The formalized hierarchies in Buddhism and Hinduism are a later conception. ",
  "dn21:1.4.2": "We will learn later of how Sakka’s appearance could be too disturbing for the Buddha while on retreat (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.10.13'>DN 21:1.10.13</a>). Pañcasikha, on the other hand, would appear alone, without a retinue. Note, however, that on subsequent occasions Sakka showed no such reticence, either because he was already a stream-enterer or because the Buddha was not in solitary retreat. ",
  "dn21:1.4.8": "The idea that the Buddha would be wooed by a love song seems like an absurd conceit, until you take into account the centaurs’ dangerous reputation as inveterate lechers. Pañcasikha wants to show that he is maturing and finally seeking a commitment in a respectable marriage. ",
  "dn21:1.5.1": "Suriyavaccasā (“Sunshine”) accords with the Vedic conception of the wife as the Sun (Sūryā, Rig Veda 10.85) who takes as husband Soma, the moon. She appears in Atharvaveda 8.10.27, which invokes the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharvas</i> with their female counterpart the “nymphs” (Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>accharā</i>, Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>apsaras</i>). ",
  "dn21:1.5.2": "In Sanskrit literature, Timbaru (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tumburu</i>, “coriander”) was an elder <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharva</i> musician in the courts of Indra and Kuvera. According to Rāmāyaṇa 3.4, he was cursed with a monstrous form by Kuvera due to an inappropriate lust for the nymph Rambhā. Upon his defeat at the hands of Rāma he was restored to his former status. Pañcasikha would have wanted to avoid a similar fate. Rather than Suriyavaccasā, the Sanskrit literature mentions his daughters Manuvantī and Sukeśī; the latter name (“pretty-hair”) evokes the streaming rays of the sun   (Vāyupurāṇa 69.49 = Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa 2.7.13). ",
  "dn21:1.5.7": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aṅgīrasi</i> means “shining one” and is etymologically linked with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>agni</i> (“fire”). Suriyavaccasā earned the name due to both her radiant nature and her family connections: her father Timbaru was a son of Kaśyapa, who was (according to certain lineages) brother of Aṅgīras, from whom the Aṅgīrasas were descended. In the Arthavaveda—the only early non-Buddhist source for a nymph named Suriyavaccasā—<i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṅgīrasi</i> is associated with witchcraft (Atharvaveda 12.5.52). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aṅgīrasa</i> is also a patronymic of the Buddha (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#3.14'>DN 32:3.14</a>).

  "dn21:1.5.8": "“Saints” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahantā</i>, which I normally translate as “perfected ones”. ",
  "dn21:1.5.11": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Parinibbāpaya</i>, “please quench me”. Pañcasikha subverts imagery employed by the Buddha—quenching thirst, cooling breezes, extinguished flames—to erotic effect. ",
  "dn21:1.5.17": "Pañcasikha is showing off his literary skill. The same image, the elephant, illustrates opposing qualities, peaceful and violent. In these two sides of sensual desire, he reveals, unconsciously perhaps, the rapacious side of his own nature. For Pañcasikha, the elephant bursting its bonds illustrates his crazed devotion, whereas later it illustrates breaking free of desire (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.12.45'>DN 21:1.12.45</a>).

  "dn21:1.5.49": "In Indian culture, a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gandharva</i> wedding is a pure love-match, without the blessing of parents or priests. Here, however, Pañcasikha wants to do the right thing and get the father’s blessing. ",
  "dn21:1.6.2": "If Pañcasikha was seeking the Buddha’s approval for his love-match, he was doomed to disappointment, as the Buddha and his mendicants do not involve themselves in arranging marriages. The Buddha sidesteps the issue by politely complementing Pañcasikha on his musicianship. ",

  "dn21:1.6.7": "“Sister” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhaginī</i>) is a respectful term of address, but is normally used in a chaste sense. When Raṭṭhapāla calls his wives “sister”, they faint in shock (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn82/en/sujato#23.4'>MN 82:23.4</a>). ",
  "dn21:1.6.8": "Sikhaṇḍī (“egg-crested”) is the term for the centaur as seductive threat to women in Atharvaveda 4.37.7. It is also a poetic term for a peacock. ",
  "dn21:1.9.3": "It is rare for the Buddha to address a deity as “venerable” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyasmā</i>), a term usually reserved for monks. Moggallāna addresses Sakka as “the venerable Kosiya” at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#10.6'>MN 37:10.6</a>; Mahākassapa calls him Kosiya without honorific at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud3.7/en/sujato#3.12'>Ud 3.7:3.12</a>. | The word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kosiya</i> is explained by the commentaries as “owl”, which, if correct, would have been the totem for a clan of that name. It is, however, a patronymic: Rig Veda 1.10.11 has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>indra kauśika</i> which means “Indra, son of Kuśika (or Kuśa)”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kuśa</i> grass is critical to the performance of Vedic rites, and the label probably initially implied “Brahmanized”, i.e. a king whose reign was authorized according to Vedic ritual.

Later Buddhists sometimes held that the status of a male was preferable. Here this is not stated outright, but the narrative implies that she thought her station was improved when becoming a male. Notably, it is not the Buddha who says this, but Sakka, relaying the story of another deity. That the proponent was a woman, at least formerly, is a trope of Indian literature: a woman is the ideal misogynist (see eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ja61/en/sujato'>Ja 61</a> or Śivapurāna chapter 4). Here, though, the situation is nuanced, because despite her (presumed) inferior status, she has better rebirth than the monks she served. ",
