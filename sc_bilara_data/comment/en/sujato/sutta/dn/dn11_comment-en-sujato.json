  "dn11:1.3": "Kevaḍḍha is mentioned only here. Manuscripts spell his name variously as Kevaddha or Kevaṭṭa (“fisherman”). The Chinese form <span lang='lzh'>堅固</span> means “sturdy” (from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dṛḍha</i>) and thus supports Kevaḍḍha. ",

Note too that Kevaḍḍha urges the Buddha to “direct” the monks (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādisatu</i>, from the same root as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>desemi</i>). I think the tension is deliberate: Kevaḍḍha says he isn’t telling the Buddha how to teach, but he absolutely is. Other readings convey the sense “attack, insult”, but this seems out of place. ",
  "dn11:3.8": "As noted previously, the basic sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāṭihāriya</i> is “demonstration”, and as the context here shows, it may or may not involve a “demonstration of wonders” i.e. a “miracle”. ",

The commentary says it was practiced by the seers of Gandhāra (north-west Pakistan). Jain tradition also knows a Gandhārī mantra, but attribute it to certain <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vidyādhara</i> deities. Sanskrit tradition similarly knows of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vidyādevī</i> (“lore goddess”) named Gandhārī.

  "dn11:69.6": "The “thirty-three” enjoy refined sensual delights. The number is a reduplication of the trinity. In Buddhist texts they are not enumerated, but Yājñavalkya reckons them as eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, plus Indra and Prajāpati (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.2).

  "dn11:70.6": "Conventionally known as “lord of gods”, but in fact the ruler only of the relatively lowly realm of the thirty-three. He is Vedic Indra, heroic slayer of the dragon Vṛtra, and is the most personally known god in the Pali Canon. ",

  "dn11:83.1": "Rather than trying to engage with Brahmā’s agenda, he keeps restating his question. This is a skillful way of curbing narcissism. ",
  "dn11:83.6": "Brahmā is embarrassed to reveal his ignorance. Perhaps a satire of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.2.13, where Yājñavalkya takes Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga by the hand and leads him aside for a secret discussion. ",
  "dn11:83.9": "At least he is honest about his lack of knowledge, even if not publicly. ",

  "dn11:85.11": "The first pair of couplets rephrase the question about where the (absorptions based on) material form cease. This couplet is also found at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.27/en/sujato#2.1'>SN 1.27:2.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud1.10/en/sujato#14.1'>Ud 1.10:14.1</a>. | A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gādha</i> is a “ford” across a river (Rig Veda 7.60.7, 7.97.8, 10.106.9; Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 1.5.2a), a safe path on which one has a “footing” to cross the water. In this verse, the verb form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gādhati</i> means to be “established” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>patiṭṭhita</i>) like a seed in soil, or a beam of light on a floor, or consciousness in name and form. ",
  "dn11:85.12": "The verse is syntactically ambiguous, as there are three couplets, each with the question-word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kattha</i>, but only two verbs. I take the first pair of couplets as a distinct verse, with the verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gādhati</i> acting as a “lamp” illuminating both the first and second couplets. These are also unified in that they deal only with material qualities. ",
  "dn11:85.13": "A similar list of descriptors elsewhere describes things that are not stolen (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato#45.1'>Snp 3.9:45.1</a>) or the kinds of sentient beings (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.8/en/sujato#4.3'>Snp 1.8:4.3</a>).

  "dn11:85.15": "This final couplet is distinguished in having a different verb (“cease”) and in including mental qualities (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāma</i>). It therefore appears there are two questions with two answers. ",
  "dn11:85.18": "This couplet is spoken by Baka the Divinity at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato#25.1'>MN 49:25.1</a>, so it was probably a free-floating couplet illustrating the Upaniṣadic theory of the Self as infinite consciousness. I think the Buddha is quoting Brahmā here in order to contrast with his own teaching of the cessation of consciousness, to emphasize that <em>even this</em> most sublime form of consciousness will cease. | “Where no form appears” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>anidassanaṁ</i>) here is a synonym for “formless” (see eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn21/en/sujato#14.8'>MN 21:14.8</a>, “space is formless and invisible”, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ākāso arūpī anidassano</i>). Normally the colors and images seen in the “form” absorptions are described as “appearing” (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#3.29.1'>DN 16:3.29.1</a>), so this indicates a formless attainment.

  "dn11:85.19": "“Infinite” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>ananta</i>) is the direct qualifier of “consciousness”, but in the Pali it is shifted to the next line to fit the meter.

This echoes descriptions of the Divinity of consciousness as “radiant” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 5.6.1, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.2) | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sabbato pabhaṁ</i> (“luminous all-round”) is synonymous with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pariyodāta</i> (“bright”, literally “white all over”), a stock descriptor of the mind of fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, on which the formless states are based. ",
  "dn11:85.20": "The division of these ten lines is not obvious. Since the previous couplet appears to be an independent saying, I take the remaining eight lines as two four-line verses.

  "dn11:85.26": "According to dependent origination, when consciousness ceases, name and form cease, and with it the manifestation of all things desirable and undesirable in the world. ",
  "dn11:85.27": "Throughout, take the locative <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ettha</i> as locative of reference, as in similar constructions at eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.30/en/sujato'>SN 1.30</a>. The point is that when the Buddha is speaking of the cessation of consciousness, he is speaking specifically of the “infinite consciousness” of the Upaniṣads: <em>that</em> is what ceases. "
