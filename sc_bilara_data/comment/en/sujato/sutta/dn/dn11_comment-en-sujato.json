  "dn11:1.2": "This was the scene for some controversial discussions with Jains ([mn56](), [sn42.8]()), and Sāriputta’s touching declaration of faith shortly before his passing ([sn47.12](), [dn16:1.16.1](), [dn28]()). ",
  "dn11:1.3": "Kevaḍḍha is mentioned only here. Manuscripts spell his name variously as Kevaddha or Kevaṭṭa (“fisherman”). The Chinese form <span lang='lzh'>堅固</span> means “sturdy” (from _dṛḍha_) and thus supports Kevaḍḍha. ",
  "dn11:1.5": "I have been asked to do the same thing for the same reason. ",
  "dn11:1.9": "In fact it is forbidden in [Kd 15:8.2.23](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#8.2.23). ",
  "dn11:2.2": "The reading _dhaṁsemi_ is dubious. An old Burmese manuscript has the reading _dhammaṁ desemi_, which echoes the Buddha just above. Note too that Kevaḍḍha urges the Buddha to “direct” the monks (_samādisatu_, from the same root as _desemi_). I think the tension is deliberate: Kevaḍḍha says he isn’t telling the Buddha how to teach, but he absolutely is. Other readings convey the sense “attack, insult”, but this seems out of place. ",
  "dn11:3.8": "As noted previously, the basic sense of _pāṭihāriya_ is “demonstration”, and as the context here shows, it may or may not involve a “demonstration of wonders” i.e. a “miracle”. ",
  "dn11:3.10": "These three are mentioned frequently in the suttas. Only the last is endorsed by the Buddha, as it leads to genuine growth. ",
  "dn11:4.5": "Their priors have been confirmed. ",
  "dn11:5.1": "Note how a skeptical mindset sticks closer to the truth. ",
  "dn11:5.2": "“Spell” is _vijjā_ “(potent) knowledge”. Obviously this spell was associated with the land of Gandhāra  (north-west Pakistan), but otherwise nothing is known about it. ",
  "dn11:5.7": "These feats that have nothing to do with spiritual growth, hence they may be produced or perhaps faked by a variety of means. ",
  "dn11:6.1": "“Revealing” is _ādesana_, from root _dis_ “to indicate, show, or point”. ",
  "dn11:6.2": "The Pali terms here are _citta_, _cetasika_, _vitakka_, and _vicāra_. ",
  "dn11:6.3": "Here we have _mano_ (twice) and _citta_. ",
  "dn11:7.2": "From _maṇi_, “gem”. Magical gems are a common feature of Indian storytelling. Buddhist stories often feature the “wish-granting gem” (_cintāmaṇi_). ",
  "dn11:67.3": "This story is presented as an actual event, but is phrased like a fable. ",
  "dn11:67.4": "The question is about meditation, not the annihilation of the material world. The first four _jhānas_ are based on the “subtle form” (_sukhumarūpa_) that manifests as light in deep meditation. He is asking how to go beyond the to the formless attainments. ",
  "dn11:68.1": "The mendicant has already well developed the _jhānas_. “Controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm” is one of the “demonstrations of psychic power” listed above. ",
  "dn11:68.2": "The “gods of the Four Great Kings” are deities born in a realm subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings. These deities inhabit the lowest of the celestial realms. ",
  "dn11:68.7": "These are powerful spirits who guard the four quarters. In [an8.36]() it is explained that they, like the other leading gods mentioned below, achieved their station due to their greater generosity and morality. ",
  "dn11:69.6": "The “Thirty-Three” are mentioned often but not enumerated. The number arises as a reduplication of the trinity. These gods enjoy refined sensual delights. ",
  "dn11:70.6": "Conventionally known as “lord of gods”, but in fact the ruler only of the relatively lowly realm of the Thirty-Three. He is Vedic Indra, and is the most personally known god in the Pali Canon. ",
  "dn11:80.5": "The previous deities achieved their station by mere morality and generosity, not by _jhāna_. The gods of Brahmā’s Host practiced the first _jhāna_, but they do not know what lies beyond. ",
  "dn11:80.7": "The same passage appears in [dn1:2.5.2](), where it also had a satirical tone, poking fun at the pomposity of religious titles. ",
  "dn11:80.8": "Even Brahmā’s community are not confident. ",
  "dn11:80.12": "This passage may be one of the sources for the later use of _nimitta_ to mean the appearance of light that signifies the approach of _jhāna_. ",
  "dn11:81.5": "He puffs his own chest, but like the ascetic teachers of [dn2](), he does not answer the question. ",
  "dn11:82.2": "He addresses Brahmā with _āvuso_. This is often translated as “friend”, but the root is _āyu_ (“age”) and it is respectful not familiar. ",
  "dn11:83.1": "Rather than trying to engage with Brahmā’s agenda, he keeps restating his question. This is a skillful way of dealing with a narcissist. ",
  "dn11:83.6": "Brahmā is embarrassed to reveal his ignorance. This may be a satire of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.2.13, where Yājñavalkya takes Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga by the hand and leads him aside for a secret discussion. ",
  "dn11:83.9": "At least he is honest about his lack of knowledge, even if not publicly. ",
  "dn11:85.10": "The following verses are difficult because they speak of a kind of consciousness at the start and the cessation of consciousness at the end. The simplest way to resolve this is to assume there are two distinct questions. ",
  "dn11:85.11": "This is a rephrasing of the original question, asking where the four “form” _jhānas_ end. ",
  "dn11:85.12": "",
  "dn11:85.13": "Here starts the second question, asking the deeper question of how all these things end. A similar list of descriptors elsewhere describes things that are not stolen ([snp3.9:45.1]()) or the kinds of sentient beings ([snp1.8:4.3]()). These are aspects of how “form” manifests in desirable or undesirable ways. ",
  "dn11:85.18": "The adjective “infinite” is the direct qualifier of “consciousness”, but in the Pali it is shifted to the next line to fit the meter. The dimension of infinite consciousness is one of the formless realms of which Brahmā has no knowledge. ",
  "dn11:85.19": "The mind of fourth _jhāna_, on which the formless states are based, is described as _pariyodāta_ (“bright”, literally “white all over”), which is a synonym for _sabbatopabhaṁ_ (“radiant all-around”). ",
  "dn11:85.26": "According to dependent origination, when consciousness ceases, name and form cease, and with it the manifestation of all things desirable and undesirable in the world. "
