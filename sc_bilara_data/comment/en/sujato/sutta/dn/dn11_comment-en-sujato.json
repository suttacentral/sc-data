  "dn11:1.2": "This was the scene for some controversial discussions with Jains ([mn56](), [sn42.8]()), and Sāriputta’s touching declaration of faith shortly before his passing ([sn47.12](), [dn16:1.16.1](), [dn28]()). ",
  "dn11:1.3": "Kevaḍḍha is mentioned only here. Manuscripts spell his name variously as Kevaddha or Kevaṭṭa (“fisherman”). The Chinese form <span lang='lzh'>堅固</span> means “sturdy” (from _dṛḍha_) and thus supports Kevaḍḍha. ",
  "dn11:1.5": "I have been asked to do the same thing for the same reason. ",
  "dn11:1.9": "In fact it is forbidden in [Kd 15:8.2.23](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#8.2.23). ",
  "dn11:3.8": "As noted previously, the basic sense of _pāṭihāriya_ is “demonstration”, and as the context here shows, it may or may not involve a “demonstration of wonders” i.e. a “miracle”. ",
  "dn11:3.10": "These three are mentioned frequently in the suttas. Only the last is endorsed by the Buddha, as it leads to genuine growth. ",
  "dn11:4.5": "Their priors have been confirmed. ",
  "dn11:5.1": "Note how a skeptical mindset sticks closer to the truth. ",
  "dn11:5.2": "“Spell” is _vijjā_ “(potent) knowledge”. Obviously this spell was associated with the land of Gandhāra  (north-west Pakistan), but otherwise nothing is known about it. ",
  "dn11:5.7": "These feats that have nothing to do with spiritual growth, hence they may be produced or perhaps faked by a variety of means. ",
  "dn11:6.1": "“Revealing” is _ādesana_, from root _dis_ “to indicate, show, or point”. ",
  "dn11:6.2": "The Pali terms here are _citta_, _cetasika_, _vitakka_, and _vicāra_. ",
  "dn11:6.3": "Here we have _mano_ (twice) and _citta_. ",
  "dn11:7.2": "From _maṇi_, “gem”. Magical gems are a common feature of Indian storytelling. Buddhist stories often feature the “wish-granting gem” (_cintāmaṇi_). ",
  "dn11:67.3": "This story is presented as an actual event, but is phrased like a fable. ",
  "dn11:67.4": "The question is about meditation, not the annihilation of the material world. The first four _jhānas_ are based on the “subtle form” (_sukhumarūpa_) that manifests as light in deep meditation. He is asking how to go beyond to the formless attainments. ",
  "dn11:68.1": "The mendicant has already well developed the _jhānas_. “Controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm” is one of the “demonstrations of psychic power” listed above. ",
  "dn11:68.2": "The “gods of the Four Great Kings” are deities born in a realm subject to the overlords known as the Four Great Kings. These deities inhabit the lowest of the celestial realms. ",
  "dn11:68.7": "These are powerful spirits who guard the four quarters. In [an8.36]() it is explained that they, like the other leading gods mentioned below, achieved their station due to their greater generosity and morality. ",
  "dn11:69.6": "The “Thirty-Three” are mentioned often but not enumerated. The number arises as a reduplication of the trinity. These gods enjoy refined sensual delights. ",
  "dn11:70.6": "Conventionally known as “lord of gods”, but in fact the ruler only of the relatively lowly realm of the Thirty-Three. He is Vedic Indra, and is the most personally known god in the Pali Canon. ",
  "dn11:80.5": "The previous deities achieved their station by mere morality and generosity, not by _jhāna_. The gods of Brahmā’s Host practiced the first _jhāna_, but they do not know what lies beyond. ",
  "dn11:80.7": "The same passage appears in [dn1:2.5.2](), where it also had a satirical tone, poking fun at the pomposity of religious titles. ",
  "dn11:80.8": "Even Brahmā’s community are not confident. ",
  "dn11:80.12": "This passage may be one of the sources for the later use of _nimitta_ to mean the appearance of light that signifies the approach of _jhāna_. ",
  "dn11:81.5": "He puffs his own chest, but like the ascetic teachers of [dn2](), he does not answer the question. ",
  "dn11:82.2": "He addresses Brahmā with _āvuso_. This is often translated as “friend”, but the root is _āyu_ (“age”) and it is respectful not familiar. ",
  "dn11:83.1": "Rather than trying to engage with Brahmā’s agenda, he keeps restating his question. This is a skillful way of dealing with a narcissist. ",
  "dn11:83.6": "Brahmā is embarrassed to reveal his ignorance. This may be a satire of Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.2.13, where Yājñavalkya takes Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga by the hand and leads him aside for a secret discussion. ",
  "dn11:83.9": "At least he is honest about his lack of knowledge, even if not publicly. ",
  "dn11:85.10": "The following verses are difficult and any interpretation is partly conjectural. The problem is that the verses speak of a kind of consciousness at the start, and the cessation of consciousness at the end. The simplest way to resolve this is to assume there are two distinct questions. ",
  "dn11:85.11": "This is a rephrasing of the original question, asking where the four “form” _jhānas_ end. ",
  "dn11:85.12": "",
  "dn11:85.13": "This, I believe, is a second question, indicated by the second verb below (_uparujjhati_). It asks the deeper question of how all things end. A similar list of descriptors elsewhere describes things that are not stolen ([snp3.9:45.1]()) or the kinds of sentient beings ([snp1.8:4.3]()). These are aspects of how “form” manifests in desirable or undesirable ways. ",
  "dn11:85.18": "The adjective “infinite” is the direct qualifier of “consciousness”, but in the Pali is shifted to the next line *metri causa*. This is the dimension of infinite consciousness, one of the formless realms of which Brahmā has no knowledge. ",
  "dn11:85.19": "_Pabhaṁ_ has been read as a “ford” (per commentary, evidently connecting it with _gādha_; but _pabhaṁ_ is not attested in this sense elsewhere), or  as “giving up” (_pahaṁ_). Perhaps it is as a paradox: it is invisible, since it is not apparent to those of lesser attainment, yet it lights the path to Nibbana. ",
  "dn11:85.26": "According to dependent origination, when consciousness ceases, name and form cease, and with it the manifestation of all things desirable and undesirable in the world. "
