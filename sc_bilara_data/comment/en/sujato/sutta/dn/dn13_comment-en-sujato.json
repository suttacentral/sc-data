  "dn13:5.2": "In Pali we never meet Tārukkha and he is only mentioned in his absence. He evidently advocated that lineage rather than conduct made one a brahmin (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#3.4'>MN 98:3.4</a>). There is a Tārukṣya whose view was that union (with Brahmā) arose with the conjunction of speech and breath; this was discussed alongside the views of many other brahmins (Aitareya Āraṇyaka 3.1.6.1; Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 7.19). In Rig Veda 8.46.32 a certain Balbūtha Tarukṣa the Dāsa makes an offering to a sage. Sāyaṇa, the Vedic commentator, says that Balbūtha Tarukṣa was a guardian of cows, evidently alluding to the Aitareya Āraṇyaka, which describes Tārukṣya as a guardian of his teacher’s cows, thus locating Tārukṣya in the lineage of Tarukṣa. Hiraṇyakeśīgṛhyasūtra 2.8.19 also mentions him as a teacher, there spelled Tarukṣa. ",
  "dn13:10.2": "Identified by Wijesekera (<em>A Pali Reference to Brāhmaṇa-Caraṇas</em>, Adyar Library Bulletin, vol 20, 1956; reprinted in <em>Buddhist and Vedic Studies</em>) and Jayatilleke (<em>Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge</em>, p. 480). I use the familiar Sanskrit forms, as the Pali has several dubious spellings and variants. Their texts and corresponding Vedas are respectively: Adhvaryu = Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (incl. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad; White Yajur Veda); Taittirīya = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (Black Yajur Veda); Chāndogya = Chāndogya Brāhmaṇa (Sāman Veda); Cāndrāyaṇa (omitted from MS edition) = Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; spelling established by Wijesekera; see below at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#16.2'>DN 13:16.2</a>); Bahvṛca = Bahvṛca Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; incorporated in Aitareya and Kauśītaki.) This is the only time the Pali canon mentions these schools, but in some cases we can identify them with brahmins in the canon. Examples include the murmuring Chāndogya brahmin (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/ud1.4/en/sujato'>Ud 1.4</a>); or the Buddha’s former teachers, who evidently hailed from the Addhariya tradition of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#15.1'>MN 26:15.1</a>ff.). | Jayatilleke notes that the Śatapatha describes its own adherents as Adhvaryu (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>addhariyā</i>), those priests of the Yajur Veda responsible for the physical acts at the ritual. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.5.2.20 and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.5.6–10 list the Adhvaryu, Chandoga, and  Bahvṛca, thus including the same schools in the same order, except the Pali has split the Yajur and Rig followers into two.

  "dn13:10.3": "Earlier they were arguing over which one of the paths was correct, whereas now they have shifted to a more universalist “many roads up the same mountain” position. When speaking with each other they saw each others’ views as contradictory, but when speaking with an outsider they adopted a more conciliatory position. ",
  "dn13:13.1": "The ten names in Pali include the seven authors of the so-called “family books” of the Rig Veda (Maṇḍalas 2–8). As founders of poetic lineages, we often find works by their descendants, which are not always confined to their dedicated family book. Poems by the other three authors are mostly outside the family books. Thus the sages listed here cover most of the Rig Veda, although the Vedic tradition records many other authors as well. | Aṭṭhaka = Atri Bhauma (Maṇḍala 5, rather than Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra of 10.104); Vāmaka = Vamra(ka) Vaikhānasa (10.99; see 9.66); Vāmadeva = Vāmadeva Gautama (Maṇḍala 4); Vessāmitta = Viśvāmitra Gāthina (Maṇḍala 3); Yamadaggi = Jamadagni Bhārgava, a descendant of Bhṛgu (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Aṅgīrasa = Aṅgirasa, identified with Agni as the founder of a lineage of poet-singers (Maṇḍala 8); Bhāradvāja = Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya (Maṇḍala 6); Vāseṭṭha = Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (Maṇḍala 7); Kassapa = Kaśyapa Mārīca (several hymns mostly in Maṇḍalas 9 and 10); Bhagu = Bhṛgu, the bringer of fire from heaven whose adoptive descendant was Gṛtsamada Bhārgava Śaunaka (Maṇḍala 2).

  "dn13:25.1": "For the following list, compare the nine gods listed at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.11 with the eight here. Six are shared with the Pali: Brahma is first, from whom derive Indra, Varuṇa, Soma, Yama, and Īsāna. Even the names that are not in common might arise from flawed transmission: Parjanya there is perhaps Pajāpati here; Rudra (or Shiva) would be well-described by Mahiddhi (“he of great power”); Mṛtyu (death) may have merged with Yama. If this connection is admitted, it would seem the Buddha is making a sly dig. Those who proclaim themselves to be true brahmins are prostrating themselves to those powers among the gods who, with the exception of Brahma himself, are in fact aristocrats (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>khattiya</i>), not brahmins at all. The Upaniṣad draws attention to the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rājasūya</i> coronation, at which the brahmin sits beneath the aristocrat. Further, Indra, Pajāpati, Varuṇa, and Īsāna are also invoked in the martial exhortation at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.3/en/sujato'>SN 11.3</a>, cementing their status as aristocrat warriors. ",
  "dn13:25.2": "Soma is the ritual drug of exhilaration, identified with the moon. | Vedic Varuṇa was the god of command, the king of tough rule. | Īsāna (Sanskrit Īśāna) was created by Pajāpati as “president”, said to be the sun (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 6.1.3). He was also identified with Rudra and Śiva. | Pajāpati (“progenitor”) was the lonely god of creation (“Let Prajāpati generate progeny for us”, Rig Veda 10.85.3).

The BJT reads Mahinda (Sanskrit Mahendra), the “Great Indra”, said to be a title of Indra bestowed after slaying the dragon Vṛtra (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2.5.4.9). | Yama (“twin”, with his incestuous sister Yamī) was born immortal but chose mortality, becoming the god of the dead.

  "dn13:79.3": "A brahmin student who for their whole life practices harmlessness for all beings—except at holy places—attains the world of Brahmā (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.15.1). The exception for holy places is, of course, to allow for the sacrifice. ",
  "dn13:81.10": "Here the entire concluding section of the Gradual Training dealing with wisdom is omitted, as the aim is limited to teaching rebirth with Brahmā to Brahmanical laypeople, rather than teaching liberation. Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja later applied to ordain, in which time the Buddha taught the full path to Nibbana (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato#7.8'>DN 27:7.8</a>). ",
  "dn13:82.4": "They also went for refuge in similar circumstances at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn98/en/sujato#14.4'>MN 98:14.4</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato#69.3'>Snp 3.9:69.3</a>. According to the commentary, that was the first time they went for refuge, while this was the second time. This makes sense in terms of the progress of the teachings, for there they discuss what makes a brahmin, whereas here they ask the more subtle question how to achieve rebirth with Brahmā. The discussion, too, is on a more detailed level, with a more explicit criticism of the brahmins. Nonetheless, it is difficult to square the details of the narratives, for the opening of this sutta depicts Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja speaking about the Buddha by reputation rather than as devotees who have previously met him and gone for refuge.
