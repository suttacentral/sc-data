  "dn32:1.1": "This discourse bears similarities to the Mahāsamayasutta (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn20/en/sujato'>DN 20</a>). Thematically, that discourse is about the devotion of the deities, whereas this is about protection for the mendicants. | I believe this is only place in whole canon that lists the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhāṇavāra</i> at the start. ",
  "dn32:2.1": "Here Kuvera is called Vessavaṇa, which our text below explains as being derived from the name of his city. ",
  "dn32:3.1": "“Protection” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rakkhā</i>, which is a synonym of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paritta</i>. ",
  "dn32:3.2": "For these verses, I lean heavily on the translation by Ānandajoti, <em><a href='https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/Texts-and-Translations/Safeguard/03-Tatiyakabhanavaram.htm'>The Āṭānāṭiya Discourse</a></em>. They are commonly recited in Theravada countries today. The recital begins with the seven Buddhas, for which see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato'>DN 14</a>. ",
  "dn32:3.14": "Here Aṅgīrasa is used as a name rather than a descriptive epithet. Aṅgīras was one of the Vedic sages and the Aṅgīrasas are his descendants. They were priestly poets who assisted Indra in freeing the cows from the Vala cave, thus ushering in the dawn. Aṅgīras is regarded as the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pravara</i> or revered ancestor of the Gotama clan. Both names are associated with light: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṅgīrasa</i> shares a root and is often synonymous with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>agni</i> (“fire”), while <i lang='pi' translate='no'>gotama</i> means “light dispelling dark”. ",
  "dn32:4.1": "Here begins a series of verses dedicated to the divinities in each of the four quarters, proceeding in the standard way: east, south, west, north. ",
  "dn32:4.9": "This is according to the commentary (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>taṁ rahadaṁ tattha evaṁ jānanti</i>). ",
  "dn32:4.29": "This relates back to the basic problem facing the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yakkhas</i>: shame. They know what they do is wrong, but they like it and hence feel shame when hearing the Dhamma. But the Buddha treats them with respect, without shaming or bias, and thus is able to lead them to the good. The commentary implicitly connects this line with <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato#2.1.2'>DN 30:2.1.2</a>, where the Buddha “examines” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>samekkhati</i>) the population for their individual and shared traits. ",
  "dn32:5.1": "The south has the shortest and least auspicious description. To the extent that it relates to physical geography, this echoes the perception of northerners at the time that the south of India lay outside the “civilized” realms (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>āryāvarta</i>). ",
  "dn32:6.1": "The description of the west mirrors the east. ",
  "dn32:7.1": "The description of the north is by far the most elaborate. | The “land north of Kuru” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>uttarakuru</i>) is mentioned in Sanskrit and Greek literature, where it sometimes appears as an actual country and other times as a place of fantasy. Attempts to locate it in a specific region in or beyond the Himalayas have proven inconclusive. ",
  "dn32:7.2": "Meru is another place that appears sometimes as a physical mountain and other times purely mystical. As home of the gods (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.11/en/sujato#4.3'>Snp 3.11:4.3</a>), its peak is accessible only by psychic powers (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig14.1/en/sujato#19.3'>Thig 14.1:19.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/sujato#30.1'>MN 50:30.1</a>).

  "dn32:7.11": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Tuṇḍikīre</i> is explained by the commentary as “firestone”. In the notes to his translation, Walshe suggests a relation with tandoor, which has been found as far back as the Indus Valley Civilization, a millennium before the Buddha. ",
  "dn32:7.13": "Cloven and uncloven was an important classification of animals in the Dharmaśāstras. ",
  "dn32:7.17": "The commentary says they were mostly carried on the backs of pregnant women(!). But the verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anuyanti</i> indicates, rather, that they were “drawn along after”, which suggests a rickshaw. ",
  "dn32:7.34": "The discourse is named after the first of these cities. The name is hard to explain, but all the names in this series have the element <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāṭa</i>, which is probably the name of the people. One meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāṭa</i> is “dance”, and one of the unique features of this discourse is that each of the Four Great Kings is said to delight in song and dance. There is a long history of dancing divinities in India, and images of dancers go back as far as the Indus Valley Civilization. If we take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāṭa</i> in the sense “the people of the dance”, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kusināṭā</i> would therefore be “dancers of the grass” after the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kusa</i> grass essential to the Vedic rites of kingship. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Parakusināṭā</i> is the “further dancers of the grass”, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>parakusiṭanāṭā</i> is probably a variation on that. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Nāṭapuriyā</i> is the “citadel of the dancers”. Each of these associates the people of the dance with the idea of protection or authority, agreeing with the context, where the cities are said to belong to a great king. Thus the prefix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āṭā-</i> probably stems from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tāṇa</i> (“shelter, refuge”; the same root as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paritta</i>), in the sense of the “refuge of the dancers”.

  "dn32:7.46": "These names suggest a connection with sustenance: “Nutritive”, “Powerful”, “Nourished by That”. ",
  "dn32:7.47": "These are a set of associated solar names. Ariṭṭha and Nemi appear compounded in Sanskrit, Ariṣṭanemi, which evokes the powerful chariot of a conqueror (“indestructible rim”, Rig Veda 1.89.6, 1.180.10, 3.53.17, 10.178.1). It was the name of the 22nd Jain <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tīrthaṅkara</i>, and in Brahmanical texts of several figures, including a dragon (Mahābhārata 1.59.39a, 1114.62a, etc.) and an Asura king (Bhāgavatapurāṇa 8.6.31, 8.10.10). Along with the divine steed Tārkṣya, he is associated with Garuḍa, and was probably originally an epithet for the unstoppable wheel of the Sun, Sūra. This line, then, while a simple list of four names in Pali, appears to be a fragmented memory of a Vedic conception which might be translated: “King Sun, (the wheel) of indestructible rim”. ",
