  "dn2:83.4": "This distinction should not be mistaken for mind-body dualism. These are not fundamental substances but experiences of a meditator. ",
  "dn2:84.2": "Strung gems were loved in India from the time in the Harappan civilization, millennia before the Buddha. ",
  "dn2:84.6": "This form of “knowledge and vision” is rarely mentioned, being found only here, at <a href='/dn10/en/sujato#2.21.3'>DN 10:2.21.3</a>, and at <a href='/mn77/en/sujato#29.2'>MN 77:29.2</a>. The next realization, the “mind-made body” is also only found in these three suttas. Note that the Mahāsaṅgīti edition adds the spurious title <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vipassanāñāṇa</i> (“insight knowledge”) to this section. This term does not appear anywhere in the Pali canon. ",
  "dn2:85.1": "The “mind-made body” is the interior mental representation of the physical body. In ordinary consciousness it is proprioception, which here is enhanced by the power of meditation. The higher powers in Buddhism are regarded as extensions and evolutions of aspects of ordinary experience, not as metaphysical realities separate from the world of mundane experience. ",
  "dn2:85.2": "This is similar to the experience of the “astral body” described by modern spiritualists. Note that it is still “physical” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpī</i>) even though it is mind-made. This is the subtle (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhuma</i>) body, which is an energetic experience of physical properties by the mind. ",
  "dn2:87.1": "Here begin the “six direct knowledges” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>chaḷabhiññā</i>), which are found commonly throughout the early texts. | “Psychic powers” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>iddhi</i>) were much cultivated in the Buddha’s day, but the means to acquire them varied: devotion to a god, brutal penances, or magic rituals. The Buddha taught that the mind developed in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādhi</i> was capable of things that are normally incomprehensible. ",
  "dn2:87.2": "Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts. The most common is the ability to disappear and reappear, exhibited by the Buddha (<a href='/an8.30/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 8.30:2.1</a>), some disciples (<a href='/mn37/en/sujato#6.1'>MN 37:6.1</a>), and deities (<a href='/mn67/en/sujato#8.1'>MN 67:8.1</a>). ",
  "dn2:88.1": "These similes hark back to the descriptions of the purified mind as pliable and workable. ",
  "dn2:88.3": "This simile is extended in detail at <a href='/an3.101/en/sujato'>AN 3.101</a>. ",
  "dn2:89.1": "“Clairaudience” is a literal rendition of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dibbasota</i>. The root sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dibba</i> is to “shine” like the bright sky or a divine being. The senses of clarity and divinity are both present. ",
  "dn2:89.2": "The Buddha occasionally used this ability for teaching, as at <a href='/mn75/en/sujato#6.1'>MN 75:6.1</a>. ",
  "dn2:90.1": "The simile emphasizes the clarity and distinctness of the sounds. Compare <a href='/an4.114/en/sujato'>AN 4.114</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bheripaṇavasaṅkhatiṇavaninnādasaddānaṁ</i>. ",
  "dn2:91.1": "Note that the Indic idiom is not the “reading” of minds, which suggests hearing the words spoken in inner dialogue. While this is exhibited by the Buddha (eg. <a href='/an8.30/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 8.30:2.1</a>), the main emphasis is on the comprehension of the overall state of mind. ",
  "dn2:92.1": "Again the simile emphasizes how clear and direct the experience is. Without deep meditation, we have some intuitive sense for the minds of others, but it is far from clear. ",
  "dn2:93.1": "Here begins the “three knowledges” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tevijjā</i>), a subset of the six direct knowledges. The first two of these play an important role in deepening understanding of the nature of suffering in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁsāra</i>. While they are not necessary for those whose wisdom is keen, they are helpful. ",
  "dn2:93.2": "Empowered by the fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. ",
  "dn2:94.1": "The word for “past life” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pubbanivāsa</i>, literally “former home”, and the imagery of houses is found in the second of the three knowledges as well. Recollection of past lives is as fresh and clear as the memory of a recent journey. ",
  "dn2:95.2": "Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; <em>why</em> rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in <a href='/dn1/en/sujato#2.5.3'>DN 1:2.5.3</a> and <a href='/mn136/en/sujato'>MN 136</a>. The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience. ",
  "dn2:96.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pāsāda</i> is often translated as “palace’ or “mansion”, but in early Pali it meant a “stilt longhouse”. As here, it is an elevated place from which one can observe the street below. ",
  "dn2:97.1": "This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>. Here they are eliminated forever. ",
  "dn2:97.2": "These are the four noble truths, which form the main content of the Buddha’s first sermon. They are the overarching principle into which all other teachings fall. The initial realization of the four noble truths indicates the first stage of awakening, stream-entry. ",
  "dn2:97.3": "The application of the four noble truths to defilements indicates that this is the final stage of awakening, perfection (or “arahantship”, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahatta</i>). | Many translators use “defilement” to render <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kilesa</i>, but since <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kilesa</i> appears only rarely in the early texts, I use “defilement” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āsava</i>. Both terms refer to a stain, corruption, or pollution in the mind. ",
  "dn2:97.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhavāsava</i> is the defilement that craves to continue life in a new birth. ",
  "dn2:97.5": "This is a reflective awareness of the fact of awakening. The meditator reviews their mind and sees that it is free from all forces that lead to suffering. ",
  "dn2:97.6": "For “state of existence” (literally “thusness”, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>itthatta</i>), see <a href='/dn15/en/sujato#21.4'>DN 15:21.4</a>. ",
  "dn2:98.1": "Once again the pool of water represents the mind, but now the meditator is not immersed in the experience, but looks back and reviews it objectively. ",
  "dn2:98.9": "The Buddha roars his lion’s roar. His teaching leads not just to some benefits, but to the highest benefits that are possible. ",
  "dn2:99.2": "The king’s distress has been alleviated by the Buddha’s uplifting words. ",
  "dn2:99.4": "This is the standard form in which lay people went for refuge. It is not something that the Buddha required, but a spontaneous act of inspiration. Conventionally, it indicates that someone is a “Buddhist”. Today Theravadins recite the going for refuge thrice, but in the early texts this is found only as the ordination for novices (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#12.4.1'>Kd 1:12.4.1</a>). ",
  "dn2:99.6": "The king, unprompted, makes an astonishing confession. To say it in such a public forum, before a spiritual community and his own retinue, displays courage and integrity. ",
  "dn2:99.7": "The Buddha hears his confession, but it is Ajātasattu’s responsibility to do better. ",
  "dn2:100.1": "Even before such a dangerous and emotionally volatile king, the Buddha does not mince words. When someone genuinely confesses, it is important to acknowledge them and not to minimize their deeds. ",
  "dn2:100.3": "Confession does not erase the past, but it does set a better course for the future. This confession is similar to that done by monastics when they have broken Vinaya rules. ",
  "dn2:102.2": "These terms are commonly used in the context of keeping precepts (eg. <a href='/an3.50/en/sujato#4.1'>AN 3.50:4.1</a>). The Buddha is supportive when he speaks with Ajātasattu, but does not hide the severity of his crime. ",
  "dn2:102.4": "The killing of one’s father is one of five “incurable” acts that doom a person to hell in the next life (<a href='/an5.129/en/sujato#1.3'>AN 5.129:1.3</a>). If he had not done so, he would have become a stream-enterer. "
