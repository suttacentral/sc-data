Late canonical Pali explains <i lang='pi' translate='no'>parimukha</i> as “the tip of the nose or the reflection of the face (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mukhanimitta</i>)”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Parimukha</i> in Sanskrit is rare, but it appears in Pāṇini 4.4.29, which the commentary illustrates with the example of a servant “in the presence” of their master (cp. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8/en/sujato'>SN 47.8</a>). So it seems the sense is “before the face” or more generally “in the presence”. | To “establish mindfulness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā</i>) is literally to “do satipaṭṭhāna”. ",
  "dn2:68.1": "Covetousness (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhijjha</i>) has been curbed by sense restraint, and now is fully abandoned. ",
  "dn2:68.2": "Likewise ill will (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>byāpādapadosa</i>), which was called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>domanassa</i> in the formula for sense restraint. ",
  "dn2:68.3": "“Mindfulness and situational awareness” has a prominent role in abandoning dullness. ",
  "dn2:68.4": "Restlessness hankers for the future and is countered by contentment. Remorse digs up the past and is countered by ethical purity. ",
  "dn2:68.5": "The meditator set out on their path after gaining faith in the Buddha. ",
  "dn2:69.1": "The happiness of meditation is hard to understand without practicing, so the Buddha gives a series of five similes to illustrate in terms Ajātasattu would understand. ",
  "dn2:74.1": "The five hindrances remain a pillar of meditation teaching. The root sense means to “obstruct” but also to “obscure, darken, veil”. ",
  "dn2:74.2": "Each simile illustrates not the happiness of acquisition, but of letting go. ",
  "dn2:74.4": "The Buddha did not emphasize technical details of technique, but the emotional wholeness and joy that leads to deep meditation. ",
  "dn2:75.1": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Jhāna</i> is a state of “elevated consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhicitta</i>), so all the terms have an elevated sense. | The plural form indicates that “sensual pleasures” includes sense experience, which the meditator can turn away from since they no longer have any desire for it. | The “unskillful qualities” are the five hindrances. | The “rapture and bliss born of seclusion” is the happiness of abandoning the hindrances and freedom from sense impingement. | “Placing the mind and keeping it connected” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vitakka</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vicāra</i>) uses terms that mean “thought” in coarse consciousness, but which in “elevated consciousness” refer to the subtle function of applying the mind to the meditation.

  "dn2:75.2": "As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>phoṭṭhabba</i>), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>manomayakāya</i>), to the direct personal realization of highest truth (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn70/en/sujato#23.2'>MN 70:23.2</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti</i>).

  "dn2:76.1": "The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience. | Here as elsewhere, water is used as a metaphor for the mind in absorption. Compare Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.32: “He becomes like water, one, the seer without duality; this is the world of Brahmā.” ",
  "dn2:76.3": "The Buddha has answered Ajātasattu’s question. But he is far from finished. ",
  "dn2:77.1": "Each <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> begins as the least refined aspect of the previous <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> ends. This is not consciously directed, but describes the natural process of settling. The meditator is now fully confident and no longer needs to apply their mind: it is simply still and fully unified. ",
  "dn2:78.1": "The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. ",
  "dn2:78.2": "The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss. ",
  "dn2:79.1": "The emotional response to bliss matures from the subtle thrill of rapture to the poise of equanimity. Mindfulness is present in all states of deep meditation, but with equanimity it becomes prominent. ",
  "dn2:80.1": "The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss. ",
  "dn2:81.1": "The emotional poise of equanimity leads to the feeling of pleasure settling into the more subtle neutral feeling. Pain and sadness have been abandoned long before, but are emphasized here as they are subtle counterpart of pleasure. ",
  "dn2:81.2": "The equanimity of the fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> is not dullness and indifference, but a brilliant and radiant awareness. ",
  "dn2:82.1": "The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content. ",
  "dn2:83.1": "Of the eight kinds of knowledge and vision, only the last is considered indispensable. The fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> is the ideal basis for developing higher knowledges, although elsewhere the canon shows that even the first <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i> can be a basis for liberating insight. Without <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, however, the eightfold path is incomplete and liberating insight is impossible. | The verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhininnāmeti</i> (“extend”) indicates that the meditator comes out of full immersion like a tortoise sticking out its limbs (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240/en/sujato#1.7'>SN 35.240:1.7</a>). ",
  "dn2:83.3": "This is the “coarse” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>olārika</i>) body. Note that its generation by mother and father contradicts the doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala. The obvious impermanence of the body invites the tempting but fallacious notion that the mind or soul is permanent, which is dispelled by deeper insight. ",
  "dn2:83.4": "This distinction should not be mistaken for mind-body dualism. These are not fundamental substances but experiences of a meditator. ",
  "dn2:84.2": "Strung gems were loved in India from the time in the Harappan civilization, millennia before the Buddha. ",
  "dn2:84.6": "This form of “knowledge and vision” is rarely mentioned, being found only here, at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn10/en/sujato#2.21.3'>DN 10:2.21.3</a>, and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn77/en/sujato#29.2'>MN 77:29.2</a>. The next realization, the “mind-made body” is also only found in these three suttas. | The Mahāsaṅgīti edition adds the spurious title <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vipassanāñāṇa</i> (“insight knowledge”) to this section. This term does not appear anywhere in the Pali canon. ",
  "dn2:85.1": "The “mind-made body” is the interior mental representation of the physical body. In ordinary consciousness it is proprioception, which here is enhanced by the power of meditation. The higher powers in Buddhism are regarded as extensions and evolutions of aspects of ordinary experience, not as metaphysical realities separate from the world of mundane experience. ",
  "dn2:85.2": "This is similar to the experience of the “astral body” described by modern spiritualists. Note that it is still “physical” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpī</i>) even though it is mind-made. This is the subtle (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sukhuma</i>) body, which is an energetic experience of physical properties by the mind. ",
  "dn2:87.1": "Here begin the “six direct knowledges” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>chaḷabhiññā</i>), which are found commonly throughout the early texts. | “Psychic powers” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>iddhi</i>) were much cultivated in the Buddha’s day, but the means to acquire them varied: devotion to a god, brutal penances, or magic rituals. The Buddha taught that the mind developed in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samādhi</i> was capable of things that are normally incomprehensible. ",
  "dn2:87.2": "Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts. The most common is the ability to “materialize and dematerialize”, exhibited by the Buddha (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.30/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 8.30:2.1</a>), some disciples (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#6.1'>MN 37:6.1</a>), and deities (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn67/en/sujato#8.1'>MN 67:8.1</a>).

  "dn2:88.1": "These similes hark back to the descriptions of the purified mind as pliable and workable. ",
  "dn2:88.3": "This simile is extended in detail at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.101/en/sujato'>AN 3.101</a>. ",
  "dn2:89.1": "“Clairaudience” is a literal rendition of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dibbasota</i>. The root sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dibba</i> is to “shine” like the bright sky or a divine being. The senses of clarity and divinity are both present. ",
  "dn2:89.2": "The Buddha occasionally used this ability for teaching, as at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/sujato#6.1'>MN 75:6.1</a>. ",
  "dn2:90.1": "The simile emphasizes the clarity and distinctness of the sounds. Compare <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.114/en/sujato'>AN 4.114</a>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bheripaṇavasaṅkhatiṇavaninnādasaddānaṁ</i>. ",
  "dn2:91.1": "Note that the Indic idiom is not the “reading” of minds, which suggests hearing the words spoken in inner dialogue. While this is exhibited by the Buddha (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.30/en/sujato#2.1'>AN 8.30:2.1</a>), the main emphasis is on the comprehension of the overall state of mind. ",
  "dn2:92.1": "Again the simile emphasizes how clear and direct the experience is. Without deep meditation, we have some intuitive sense for the minds of others, but it is far from clear. ",
  "dn2:93.1": "Here begins the “three knowledges” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>tevijjā</i>), a subset of the six direct knowledges. The first two of these play an important role in deepening understanding of the nature of suffering in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁsāra</i>. While they are not necessary for those whose wisdom is keen, they are helpful. ",
  "dn2:93.2": "Empowered by the fourth <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. The knowledge of these events is not hazy or murky, but clear and precise, illuminated by the brilliance of purified consciousness. ",
  "dn2:94.1": "The word for “past life” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pubbenivāsa</i>, literally “former home”, and the imagery of houses is found in the second of the three knowledges as well. Recollection of past lives is as fresh and clear as the memory of a recent journey. ",
  "dn2:95.2": "Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; <em>why</em> rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2.5.3'>DN 1:2.5.3</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn136/en/sujato'>MN 136</a>. The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience. | “Clairvoyance” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dibbacakkhu</i> (“celestial eye”), for which see Chāndogya Upaniṣad 8.12.5, “the mind is (the self’s) celestial eye” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mano’sya daivaṁ cakṣuḥ</i>).

As here, it is an elevated place from which one can observe the street below. ",
  "dn2:97.1": "This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhāna</i>. Here they are eliminated forever. ",
  "dn2:97.2": "These are the four noble truths, which form the main content of the Buddha’s first sermon. They are the overarching principle into which all other teachings fall. The initial realization of the four noble truths indicates the first stage of awakening, stream-entry. ",
  "dn2:97.3": "The application of the four noble truths to defilements indicates that this is the final stage of awakening, perfection (or “arahantship”, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>arahatta</i>). | Many translators use “defilement” to render <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kilesa</i>, but since <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kilesa</i> appears only rarely in the early texts, I use “defilement” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āsava</i>. Both terms refer to a stain, corruption, or pollution in the mind. ",
  "dn2:97.4": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhavāsava</i> is the defilement that craves to continue life in a new birth. ",
  "dn2:97.5": "This is a reflective awareness of the fact of awakening. The meditator reviews their mind and sees that it is free from all forces that lead to suffering. ",
  "dn2:97.6": "This is a standard declaration of full awakening in the suttas, said both of the Buddha and of any arahant (“perfected one”). Each of the four phrases illustrates a cardinal principle of awakening. (1) Further transmigration through rebirths has come to an end due to the exhaustion (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>khīṇa</i>) of that which propels rebirth, namely deeds motivated by craving. (2) The eightfold path has been developed fully in all respects. (3) All functions relating to the four noble truths have been completed, namely: understanding suffering, letting go craving, witnessing extinguishment, and developing the path.

  "dn2:99.4": "This is the standard form in which lay people went for refuge. It is not something that the Buddha required, but a spontaneous act of inspiration. Conventionally, it indicates that someone is a “Buddhist”.

  "dn2:100.1": "Even before such a dangerous and emotionally volatile king, the Buddha does not mince words. The Buddha makes a point to acknowledge what the king had done, without dismissing it and thereby discounting the inner work he had achieved to get to this point. ",
  "dn2:100.3": "Confession does not erase the past, but it does set a better course for the future. This confession is similar to that done by monastics when they have broken Vinaya rules. ",
