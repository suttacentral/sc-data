  "dn2:1.3": "The Komudī was an especially celebrated full moon on the last month of the rainy season (_kattikā_, October/November), when the skies were clear, the lotuses (_kumudā_) were in bloom, and the moon was in conjunction with the Pleiades, which gave the month its name. ",
  "dn2:1.4": "_Ajātasattu_ means “one against whom no foe is born”. He was son of Bimbisāra and heir to the Haryaṅka dynasty of Magadha. Jain tradition holds that his mother was Cellaṇā daughter of Ceṭaka, a Licchavī ruler from Vesālī. This begs the question as to why Cellaṇā was said to be “of Videha”; perhaps he married a Videhan princess to forge an alliance with the Licchavī’s northern neighbors. In any case, this is more plausible than the Buddhist tradition that his mother was Kosalan. ",
  "dn2:1.5": "_Pāsādikā_ here does not mean “tranquil”; it is part of a stock list of terms meaning “beautiful, attractive” (eg. [dn4:13.7]()). | _Lakkhaññā_ is unique in early Pali. It is probably a synonym in the sense of “possessing remarkable features, striking”, rather than “auspicious”. ",
  "dn2:1.6": "The king seeks redemption through his own actions; it is not that the ascetic has any special power to bring peace to his mind. | The sutta is deliberately holding back the reason for the king’s distress. Compare [an5.50](), where the reason for King Muṇḍa seeking solace is stated up front. ",
  "dn2:2.1": "Though the king mentioned “ascetics and brahmins”, his advisers only recommend famous teachers of the ascetics (_samaṇa_). For a shorter survey of their doctrines, see [sn2.30](). ",
  "dn2:2.2": "A little-known teacher of the inefficacy of action and consequence, Pūraṇa was poorly regarded even by his own students ([mn77:6.19]()). He is said to have advocated a doctrine of six classes of rebirth ([an6.57](); the same text reverentially mentions Makkhali Gosāla). | _Pūraṇa_ means “filling” (not _purāṇa_, “ancient”). ",

None of their texts survive, but their teachings can be partially reconstructed from Buddhist and Jain sources. He practiced with Mahāvīra for six years before an acrimonious split, following which he developed his doctrine of hard determinism. _Makkhali_ denotes a kind of ascetic bearing a bamboo staff, so (like the similar appellations _nigaṇṭha_ and _samaṇa_) it indicates his affiliation. This being so, and noting that Buddhist Sanskrit texts spell his name as _gośālīputra_ etc., the second name (like _nātaputta_ and _gotama_) might indicate his clan. However, I can find no trace of such a clan, and both Jain and Buddhist tradition, albeit unreliably, say the name arose because he was born in a cowshed. ",
  "dn2:4.2": "A materialist, he was an early proponent of the ideas later known as Cārvāka. _Kesakambala_ means “hair-blanket”, which was worn as an ascetic practice ([an3.137]()). ",

His name is obscure. Sanskrit spells it _vairaṭṭīputra_, with several variations, but always with _ṭi_. The commentary says he was the “son of Belaṭṭha”; a Belaṭṭha Kaccāna is found selling sugar at [Kd 6:26.1.2](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#26.1.2), supporting the idea that Belaṭṭha was a personal rather than clan name.

He is regarded as the 24th supreme leader of the Jains, although only he and his predecessor Pārśvanātha (not mentioned in the Pali) are historical. _Nigaṇṭha_ means “knotless” (i.e. without attachments); it is a term for a Jain ascetic. Nātaputta indicates his clan the Ñātikas (Sanskrit _jñātiputra_; Prākrit _nāyaputta_). The Pali tradition has confused _ñāti_  (“family”) with _nāṭa_ (“dancer”). Thus Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta means “the Jain monk of the Ñātika clan”. | Jainism and Buddhism are the only ancient _samaṇa_ movements to survive to the present day. The primary Jain teaching is the practice of non-violence while burning off past kamma by fervent austerities in order to reach omniscient liberation. ",

  "dn2:8.4": "According to the Vinaya, a monastery is normally offered to the “Saṅgha of the four quarters” and becomes their inalienable property.

  "dn2:10.12": "This is a double pun. _Dīpa_ means “lamp” or “island, refuge”, while _jhāyati_ means “burning” or “meditating”.

  "dn2:15.1": "The term “Great King” (_mahārāja_) identifies Ajātasattu as the hereditary monarch of a large realm, in contrast with the multiple elected “rulers” of the aristocratic republics such as Vajji and Sakya. ",
  "dn2:15.3": "As in [dn1:1.4.2](), the Buddha begins by asking to hear what others have said. ",
  "dn2:16.2": "As with his meeting with the Buddha, Ajātasattu is respectful but not reverential. ",
  "dn2:17.2": "This is a denial of the doctrine of kamma. While his doctrine appears to be morally nihilistic, it seems unlikely this was Pūraṇa Kassapa’s full teaching. He may have subscribed to hard determinism, so that we have no choice in what we do. He may also have believed that we should keep moral rules as a social contract, but that this had no effect on the afterlife. ",

  "dn2:18.7": "The commentary takes _uggahita_ and _nikkujjita_ as synonyms. Elsewhere, however, _nikkujjati_ always means “overturns”. ",
  "dn2:20.2": "This denies the principle of causality and the efficacy of action. The fatalistic teachings of the Ājīvikas led to them becoming popular as prognosticators. ",
  "dn2:20.5": "The first three phrases, with the Magadhan nominative singular in _-e_, are unique to this passage. In [an6.38:1.4]() we find the regular nominative form in _-o_. ",

  "dn2:20.7": "This strange cosmology lays out the course through which souls must proceed before their final liberation. | Since _nāgāvāsa_ (“abode of dragons”) occurs in a list of kinds of ascetics, I think it is a corruption of _naggāvāsa_ (“abode of naked ascetics”) and translate accordingly. Each of these refers to the number of times one will be reborn in each of these states. | _Nigaṇṭhigabbha_ could mean “rebirth as a Jain ascetic” but here we have moved on from listing ascetics, and I think it refers to one who is born free of attachments. Compare the Buddhist idea of “four kinds of conception” ([dn33:1.11.175]()). | _Pavuṭā_ is explained by the commentary as _gaṇṭhikā_ (“knot”). However, Rig Veda 9.54.2 mentions “seven rivers” (_sapta pravata_) that flow from heaven, preceded in the same verse by the mention of _sarā_ (“lakes”). This detail suggests a Vedic influence. The “seven rivers” are normally called _sapta sindhu_ (Rig Veda 1.35.8) in reference to the river systems of north-west India and Pakistan (cf. Punjab, “five rivers”). ",
  "dn2:20.8": "To “force unripened deeds to bear their fruit” by means of “fervent austerity” (_tapas_) is a Jain practice, whereas to “eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little” is distinguished from the Jain view at [an3.74](). ",
  "dn2:21.1": "“Purification through transmigration” is _saṁsārasuddhi_. ",
  "dn2:23.2": "The denial of “mother and father” is usually interpreted as the denial of moral duty towards ones’ parents. However, I think it is a doctrine of conception which denies that a child is created by the mother and father. Rather, the child is produced by the four elements, with parents as mere instigators and incubators. ",
  "dn2:23.3": "This is a materialist analysis of the person. ",
  "dn2:26.2": "This is a reductive atomism. It argues that since all things are made of the seven fundamental substances, higher-order entities have no significance. ",
  "dn2:26.5": "Unlike the materialism of Ajita Kesakambala, one of the basic substances is the soul. He uses _jīva_, the same term used by the Jains, rather than _attā_ as preferred by the brahmins. ",
  "dn2:29.2": "While restraint is an important aspect of Jain practice, the “fourfold restraint” has not been traced to Jain scriptures. It is also found at [mn56:1.2](), which offers a more detailed refutation of the doctrine. At [dn25:16.4]() the Buddha reinterprets the “fourfold restraint” as keeping precepts, while at [mn12:44.1]() the Buddha says he used to practice a “four-factored spiritual path” that consisted of Jain-like austerities.

  "dn2:29.4": "Jains regarded water as both a living thing and full of living things.

  "dn2:37.5": "_Karakārako rāsivaḍḍhako_ is a unique phrase. For _karakāraka_, compare [mn57:2.3](), where a naked ascetic “does a hard thing”. _Rāsi_ means “heap” (of grain or wealth according to the commentary). ",

The plural form indicates that “sensual pleasures” includes sense experience, which the meditator can turn away from since they no longer have any desire for it. The “unskillful qualities” are the five hindrances. The “rapture and bliss born of seclusion” is the happiness of abandoning the hindrances and freedom from sense impingement. “Placing the mind and keeping it connected” (_vitakka_, _vicāra_) uses terms that mean “thought” in coarse consciousness, but which in “elevated consciousness” refer to the subtle function of applying the mind to the meditation.

  "dn2:75.2": "As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (_phoṭṭhabba_), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (_manomayakāya_), to the direct personal realization of highest truth ([mn70:23.2](): _kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti_).

  "dn2:85.1": "The “mind-made body” is the interior mental representation of the physical body. In ordinary consciousness it is proprioception, which here is enhanced by the power of meditation.

  "dn2:85.2": "This is similar to the experience of the “astral body” described by modern spiritualists. Note that it is still “physical” (_rūpī_) even though it is mind-made. This is the subtle (_sukhuma_) body, which is an energetic experience of physical properties by the mind. ",
  "dn2:87.1": "Here begin the “six direct knowledges” (_chaḷabhiññā_), which are found commonly throughout the early texts. | “Psychic powers” (_iddhi_) were much cultivated in the Buddha’s day, but the means to acquire them varied: devotion to a god, brutal penances, or magic rituals. The Buddha taught that the mind developed in _samādhi_ was capable of things that are normally incomprehensible. ",
  "dn2:87.2": "Only a few of these are attested as events in the early texts. The most common is the ability to disappear and reappear, exhibited by the Buddha ([an8.30:2.1]()), some disciples ([mn37:6.1]()), and deities ([mn67:8.1]()). ",
  "dn2:88.1": "These similes hark back to the descriptions of the purified mind as pliable and workable. ",
  "dn2:88.3": "This simile is extended in detail at [an3.101](). ",
  "dn2:89.1": "“Clairaudience” is a literal rendition of _dibbasota_. The root sense of _dibba_ is to “shine” like the bright sky or a divine being. The senses of clarity and divinity are both present. ",
  "dn2:89.2": "The Buddha occasionally used this ability for teaching, as at [mn75:6.1](). ",
  "dn2:90.1": "The simile emphasizes the clarity and distinctness of the sounds. Compare [an4.114](): _bheripaṇavasaṅkhatiṇavaninnādasaddānaṁ_. ",
  "dn2:91.1": "Note that the Indic idiom is not the “reading” of minds, which suggests hearing the words spoken in inner dialogue. While this is exhibited by the Buddha (eg. [an8.30:2.1]()), the main emphasis is on the comprehension of the overall state of mind. ",
  "dn2:92.1": "Again the simile emphasizes how clear and direct the experience is. Without deep meditation, we have some intuitive sense for the minds of others, but it is far from clear. ",
  "dn2:93.1": "Here begins the “three knowledges” (_tevijjā_), a subset of the six direct knowledges. The first two of these play an important role in deepening understanding of the nature of suffering in _saṁsāra_. While they are not necessary for those whose wisdom is keen, they are helpful. ",
  "dn2:93.2": "Empowered by the fourth _jhāna_, memory breaks through the veil of birth and death, revealing the vast expanse of time and dispelling the illusion that there is any place of eternal rest or sanctuary in the cycle of transmigration. The knowledge of these events is not hazy or murky, but clear and precise, illuminated by the brilliance of purified consciousness. ",
  "dn2:94.1": "The word for “past life” is _pubbanivāsa_, literally “former home”, and the imagery of houses is found in the second of the three knowledges as well. Recollection of past lives is as fresh and clear as the memory of a recent journey. ",
  "dn2:95.2": "Here knowledge extends to the rebirths of others as well as oneself. Even more significant, it brings in the understanding of cause and effect; *why* rebirth happens the way it does. Such knowledge, however, is not infallible, as the Buddha warns in [dn1:2.5.3]() and [mn136](). The experience is one thing; the inferences drawn from it are another. One should draw conclusions only tentatively, after long experience. ",
  "dn2:96.1": "_Pāsāda_ is often translated as “palace’ or “mansion”, but in early Pali it meant a “stilt longhouse”. As here, it is an elevated place from which one can observe the street below. ",
  "dn2:97.1": "This is the experience of awakening that is the true goal of the Buddhist path. The defilements—properties of the mind that create suffering—have been curbed by the practice of ethics and suppressed by the power of _jhāna_. Here they are eliminated forever. ",
  "dn2:97.2": "These are the four noble truths, which form the main content of the Buddha’s first sermon. They are the overarching principle into which all other teachings fall. The initial realization of the four noble truths indicates the first stage of awakening, stream-entry. ",
  "dn2:97.3": "The application of the four noble truths to defilements indicates that this is the final stage of awakening, perfection (or “arahantship”, _arahatta_). | Many translators use “defilement” to render _kilesa_, but since _kilesa_ appears only rarely in the early texts, I use “defilement” for _āsava_. Both terms refer to a stain, corruption, or pollution in the mind. ",
  "dn2:97.4": "_Bhavāsava_ is the defilement that craves to continue life in a new birth. ",
  "dn2:97.5": "This is a reflective awareness of the fact of awakening. The meditator reviews their mind and sees that it is free from all forces that lead to suffering. ",
  "dn2:97.6": "This is a standard declaration of full awakening in the suttas, said both of the Buddha and of any arahant (“perfected one”). Each of the four phrases illustrates a cardinal principle of awakening. (1) Further transmigration through rebirths has come to an end due to the exhaustion (_khīṇa_) of that which propels rebirth, namely deeds motivated by craving. (2) The eightfold path has been developed fully in all respects. (3) All functions relating to the four noble truths have been completed, namely: understanding suffering, letting go craving, witnessing extinguishment, and developing the path. (4) Extinguishment is final, with no falling back to this or any other state of existence. | For “state of existence” (literally “thusness”, _itthatta_), see [dn15:21.4](). ",
  "dn2:98.1": "Once again the pool of water represents the mind, but now the meditator is not immersed in the experience, but looks back and reviews it objectively. ",
  "dn2:98.9": "The Buddha roars his lion’s roar. His teaching leads not just to some benefits, but to the highest benefits that are possible. ",
  "dn2:99.2": "The king’s distress has been alleviated by the Buddha’s uplifting words. ",
  "dn2:99.4": "This is the standard form in which lay people went for refuge. It is not something that the Buddha required, but a spontaneous act of inspiration. Conventionally, it indicates that someone is a “Buddhist”. Today Theravadins recite the going for refuge thrice, but in the early texts this is found only as the ordination for novices ([Kd 1:12.4.1](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#12.4.1)). ",
  "dn2:99.6": "The king, unprompted, makes an astonishing confession. To say it in such a public forum, before a spiritual community and his own retinue, displays courage and integrity. ",
  "dn2:99.7": "The Buddha hears his confession, but it is Ajātasattu’s responsibility to do better. ",
  "dn2:100.1": "Even before such a dangerous and emotionally volatile king, the Buddha does not mince words. When someone genuinely confesses, it is important to acknowledge them and not to minimize their deeds. ",
  "dn2:100.3": "Confession does not erase the past, but it does set a better course for the future. This confession is similar to that done by monastics when they have broken Vinaya rules. ",
  "dn2:102.2": "These terms are commonly used in the context of keeping precepts (eg. [an3.50:4.1]()). The Buddha is supportive when he speaks with Ajātasattu, but does not hide the severity of his crime. ",
  "dn2:102.4": "The killing of one’s father is one of five “incurable” acts that doom a person to hell in the next life ([an5.129:1.3]()). If he had not done so, he would have become a stream-enterer. "
