Some of these details are shared with <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.96/en/sujato'>SN 22.96</a>, which however does not mention the name Mahāsudassana. ",
  "dn17:1.5.3": "Readings vary. The Sanskrit text has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saptapauruṣā ardhacaturthapauruṣāś ca nikhātā</i>. ",
  "dn17:1.6.13": "I think the point is that they listened to the music rather than doing bad things. ",
  "dn17:1.7.3": "This is specific instance, so I use past tense. Where it is an abstract description of a legendary past, I use the present tense to denote an eternal or mythic present. ",
  "dn17:1.7.4": "The wheel is firstly the sun and secondly the wheel of the chariots that drove the Indo-Europeans in their conquests. It is the manifestation of unstoppable power. The solar imagery is reflected in the name Mahāsudassana (“Great Splendor”). The whole story reflects the Indo-European dream of universal domination. ",
  "dn17:1.8.1": "Many of the details in this myth echo the Brahmanical horse sacrifice. Since the horse was the primary source of Indo-European dominion, its sacrifice served to authorize the power of a king. It was a costly and dangerous rite that was attempted only by the greatest of sovereigns. | <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhiṅkāra</i> (“ceremonial vase”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>abbhukkirati</i> (“besprinkled”) are elevated terms.

  "dn17:1.8.3": "In the horse sacrifice, the horse is released for a year, while the king follows it with his army, claiming any land that it wanders on as his. ",

These have sometimes been rendered “eat”, “enjoy”, or “govern”. But compare the archaic English “use” meaning “the benefit or profit of lands”. Thus <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yathābhuttañca bhuñjatha</i> means “use as has been used”, i.e. “maintain the current level of taxation”. ",
  "dn17:1.10.1": "The Wheel plunges into the seas, while the sacrificial horse is born in the western and eastern seas. ",
  "dn17:1.10.9": "Historically, India has usually been divided into squabbling realms, but from an early age there was a dream of a unified and peaceful continent. ",
  "dn17:1.11.1": "“At the High Court” is uncertain. Read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍa</i> (variants <i lang='pi' translate='no'>attha</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṭṭa</i>) which in Sanskrit has the senses “solve, infer, argue, discern”. The commentary interprets <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍakaraṇa</i> as the “place of judgement” i.e. the court, which is clearly the case here (see also <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.7/en/sujato#1.5'>SN 3.7:1.5</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn89/en/sujato#13.3'>MN 89:13.3</a>). The affix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-pamukha</i> here does not mean “entrance”. Rather, it describes the attributes of a wheel-turning monarch in the sense of “finest” (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.5.1'>DN 17:2.5.1</a>). ",
  "dn17:1.12.2": "The white elephant is a symbol of royalty to this day. The description anticipates the elephant Indra acquired in later legends, Airāvata the “cloudy”, white and huge and moving through the sky. | For <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattappatiṭṭho</i>, the commentary has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>susaṇṭhitaaṅgapaccaṅga</i> (“well-grounded on each and every limb”), a sense confirmed by the Mūlasarvāstivāda Bhaiṣajyavastu which has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saptāṅgaḥ supratiṣṭhito</i> (“well-established on seven limbs”). The subcommentary lists the four feet, trunk, tail, and penis (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>varaṅga</i>). ",
  "dn17:1.13.2": "The sacrificial horse is likewise white with black head or forequarters. It is identified with the sun, thus being a “sky-walker”. “Thundercloud” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>valāhaka</i>; Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>balāhaka</i>) is the name of one of the four horses of Kṛṣṇa’s chariot in the Mahābharata. The description here also recalls the Vedic sacred horse Uccaiḥśravas. ",
  "dn17:1.18.2": "The “commander” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pariṇāyaka</i>) is mostly found in Buddhist texts of this context, and is not a regular term of governance. This passage shows that he was responsible for management of the realm, while below he appears as commander of the army (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#2.8.2'>DN 17:2.8.2</a>). Elsewhere he is said to excel in strategy (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.134/en/sujato#2.5'>AN 5.134:2.5</a>). ",
  "dn17:1.23.9": "The jarring inclusion of “women” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>itthī</i>) in this list probably refers to state-sponsored prostitution. ",

  "dn17:1.25.2": "The palace is named “Principle” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhamma</i>) in recognition of the king being subject to a higher law. Normally I translate <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> as “stilt longhouse” but here something grander is meant. ",

  "dn17:2.1.4": "Thus denying the doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#17.5'>DN 2:17.5</a>. This is the recognition, at least partially, of right view. ",

  "dn17:2.5.2": "“Palace” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i>, literally “stilt longhouse”. ",
  "dn17:2.5.3": "“Chamber” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kūṭāgāra</i>, literally “building with peaked roof”. Normally this means “bungalow”, but in a similar description at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#8.9'>MN 37:8.9</a> we hear of a “palace” with a hundred “towers” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>niyyūha</i>), each of which has seven hundred “chambers”. Thus the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kūṭāgāra</i> must be a structure many of which can belong to a palace, namely “chamber”, while <i lang='pi' translate='no'>viyūha</i> (spelled <i lang='pi' translate='no'>byūha</i> at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.96/en/sujato#3.4'>SN 22.96:3.4</a>) must have the same meaning as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>niyyūha</i>, i.e. “tower”.
