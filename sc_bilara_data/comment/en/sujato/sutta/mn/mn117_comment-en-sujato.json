  "mn117:3.4": "While it is possible to obtain immersion outside the context of the noble eightfold path, without all the factors of the path working together it does not result in liberation and hence is not “right” immersion. | This became known in the Abhidhamma as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lokuttara jhāna</i>, where it is used in the same sense as the sutta: a meditative absorption which, empowered by all the path factors in concert, leads to the realization of the Dhamma. This is contrasted with the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>lokiya jhāna</i> that leads only to rebirth in the Brahmā realm; see comment on <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn7/en/sujato#19.6'>MN 7:19.6</a>.

A similar distinction, however, is made in the Chinese translation of the Saṁyukta Āgama of the (Mūla)-Sarvāstivāda at SA 785 and SA 789, which contains analyses of the transcendent factors that are similar to those in Pali. | “Transcendent” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>lokuttara</i>) means “leading beyond the world (of transmigration)”.
