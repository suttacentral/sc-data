  "mn56:2.1": "Jain tradition holds that Mahāvīra passed at a Pāvā near Nāḷandā. Buddhist texts know only the Pāvā of the Mallians to the north. Evidently there has been some confusion, and perhaps “Pāvārika’s mango grove”, the site of discussions with Jains here and at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn42.8/en/sujato'>SN 42.8</a>, is the Pāvā known to the Jains. Note, however, that the earliest Jain source for Mahāvīra’s passing, the Kalpasutra, does not say where Pāvā is. But it does say the events were commemorated by the rulers of Kāsī and Kosala, and the Mallians and the Licchavīs. The absence of Magadha and the presence of Malla sit better with the location of Pāvā in Malla rather than Magadha. ",

  "mn56:3.12": "In Jainism, all three “rods” create <i lang='pi' translate='no'>karma</i>, which in Jainism is a kind of subtle matter (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pudgala</i>) that adheres to and obscures the soul ( Tattvārthasūtra 6.1–2). Thus all <i lang='pi' translate='no'>karma</i> is material. Nonetheless, according to Dr. Hiralal Jain, <em>Jainism in Buddhist Literature</em>, the Jain position is not that physical actions are more important, since all three kinds of action must be intentional. Rather, it is that intentional actions performed through the body have a greater weight than those performed by speech or by thought alone. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Karma</i> in the Jain system is the result of such intentional action, which clings to the soul as a form of matter.
