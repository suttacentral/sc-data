  "mn90:1.1": "The whole narrative of this sutta is entertainingly chaotic, with characters appearing and disappearing at random, many of whom are unknown or little-known elsewhere. This is a lifelike impression of how hard it is to maintain a rational dialogue among the comings and goings. Historically it gives a brief but telling character portrait of Viḍūḍabha, the ill-starred prince of Kosala. ",

  "mn90:5.3": "The Buddha was well aware of the fact that people did, in fact, make such claims, as he discussed them several times (eg. <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn76/en/sujato#21.1'>MN 76:21.1</a>). He just thought the claims were wrong. One unique detail of the phrasing here is that it is in future tense (also used below at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn90/en/sujato#8.5'>MN 90:8.5</a>). The implication seems to be that not only is it the case that no-one currently makes such claims, but that no-one ever will in the future. | Compare with other statements on omniscience at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn14/en/sujato#17.3'>MN 14:17.3</a> and <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn71/en/sujato#5.2'>MN 71:5.2</a>.

At <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn76/en/sujato#52.5'>MN 76:52.5</a> the Buddha discusses the related point of whether knowledge is continuous, illustrating it with a simile of an amputee. ",

In such cases the verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi</i> implies continued existence in a future life. We find a similar usage in Kaṭha Upaniṣad 1.20, where Naciketa wonders what happens to a man after he dies, as “some say he survives, while others say he does not survive” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>astīty eke nāyam astīti caike</i>).
