  "mn5:2.3": "“Blemish” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>aṅgaṇa</i>) is used literally as a mark or discoloration on the face (<a href='/mn15/en/sujato#8.3'>MN 15:8.3</a>), and metaphorically in the sense of a psychological defect. It stems from the root √<i lang='pi' translate='no'>añj</i> in the sense of something smeared on the skin such as ointment (<a href='/mn75/en/sujato#23.13'>MN 75:23.13</a>) or eyeshadow (<a href='/mn82/en/sujato#25.14'>MN 82:25.14</a>).

  "mn5:6.1": "“Feature of beauty” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>subhanimitta</i>. In early Pali, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nimitta</i> is used for a feature or quality of the mind that, when focused on, promotes the growth of similar or related qualities.

  "mn5:11.2": "Many Vinaya offences can be cleared by a simple confession to a single fellow monastic. In more serious cases, however, the entire resident Saṅgha must be involved in the rehabilitation process. In such cases, a sense of collective shame is essential to motivate the offender to change their ways. ",
  "mn5:12.2": "“Counterpart” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṭipuggala</i>) is elsewhere used of the Buddha, where it is paired with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sama</i> in a negative sense, “without equal or rival” (eg. <a href='/mn56/en/sujato#29.54'>MN 56:29.54</a>).

In the Buddha’s time, however, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anumodana</i> was not an incomprehensible chant in an ancient language believed to confer a special “blessing”.
