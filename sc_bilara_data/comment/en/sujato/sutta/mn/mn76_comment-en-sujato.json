However, I think it is a doctrine of conception which denies that a child is created by the mother and father. Rather, the child is produced by the four elements, with parents as mere instigators and incubators. ",

While his doctrine appears to be morally nihilistic, it seems unlikely this was Pūraṇa Kassapa’s full teaching. He may have subscribed to hard determinism, so that we have no choice in what we do. He may also have believed that we should keep moral rules as a social contract, but that this had no effect on the afterlife. | In such contexts, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kar-</i> means “punish, inflict” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn129/en/sujato#29.2'>MN 129:29.2</a>).
