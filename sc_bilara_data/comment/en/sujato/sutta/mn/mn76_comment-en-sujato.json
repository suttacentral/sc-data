  "mn76:3.2": "Evidently an excursion for sightseeing was popular. As well as simply enjoying nature, such trips give the mendicants a chance to check out possible places to stay for meditation. ",
  "mn76:4.7": "This sentence is redundant as it stands. But wherever this idiom occurs elsewhere, it specifies that the person is a lay disciple (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn25/en/sujato#3.5'>DN 25:3.5</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn78/en/sujato#3.7'>MN 78:3.7</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.93/en/sujato#2.7'>AN 10.93:2.7</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.94/en/sujato#3.4'>AN 10.94:3.4</a>).

However, I think it is a doctrine of conception which denies that a child is created by the mother and father. Rather, the child is produced by the four elements, with parents as mere instigators and incubators. ",
  "mn76:7.3": "This is a materialist analysis of the person. | The word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāya</i> (“substance”) is central to Jainism. Ācārāṅgasūtra 8.1.11 speaks of the “substances” of earth, water, fire, and air as being imbued with life so one should avoid damaging them. ",

While his doctrine appears to be morally nihilistic, it seems unlikely this was Pūraṇa Kassapa’s full teaching. He may have subscribed to hard determinism, so that we have no choice in what we do. He may also have believed that we should keep moral rules as a social contract, but that this had no effect on the afterlife. | In such contexts, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kar-</i> means “punish, inflict” (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn129/en/sujato#29.2'>MN 129:29.2</a>).

There are several inconsistencies in the presentation of these views in Pali, and still more when parallels are considered.

Perhaps, however, “she whose sons are dead” is an allusion to a child-killing <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yakkhinī</i> such as Hārītī of Madhurā or Kālī in the commentary to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp5/en/sujato'>Dhp 5</a>, thus having the force, “sons of a she-devil”. Either way this is unsatisfactory, a curse or slur intruding into a passage whose intent is to highlight the Buddha’s fair-minded treatment of others. Nonetheless, lacking a compelling alternative I follow the commentary. "
