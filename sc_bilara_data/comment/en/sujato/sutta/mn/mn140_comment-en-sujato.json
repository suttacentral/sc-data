  "mn140:1.3": "The Bhaggava clan was descended from the ancient sage Bhagu (Sanskrit Bhṛgu). They received the gift of fire conveyed by Mātariśvan the wind from the god Agni (eg. Rig Veda 1.60.1). In Pali they appear as potters (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn81/en/sujato#19.3'>MN 81:19.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.50/en/sujato#11.2'>SN 1.50:11.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn2.24/en/sujato#12.2'>SN 2.24:12.2</a>), unless they have gone forth (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#1.1.6'>DN 24:1.1.6</a>). Archaeologists refer to the strata around the Buddha’s time as the Northern Black Polished Ware culture on account of the distinctive highly glazed polish that was achieved on the pottery of the time. This, together with the production of iron, marked a significant advance in the mastery of fire. Thus potters were no mere humble craftsmen, but leading technological innovators. ",
  "mn140:3.1": "Buddhist texts of the middle period—starting a few centuries after the Buddha—share the story that Pukkusāti had been the king of Taxila in Gandhāra, who went forth out of faith upon reading texts of the Dhamma sent by his friend and ally, Bimbisāra. This story is found in detail in the Pali commentary to this sutta, and more briefly in several canonical texts of the northern traditions (T 211 at T iv 580c19; T 511 at T xiv 779a; Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya 3.2.26, which spells his name <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puṣkarasāri</i>, the same name as the brahmin known in Pali as Pokkharasāti). Texts of this period also know of a script called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puṣkarasāri</i> (Lalitavistara 10, Vaidya 87; Mahāvastu 14, Senart 1.135). This would presumably have been the writing system in the city of Puṣkarāvati, another city in Gandhāra, the region where the oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts have been found. The details of the Pukkusāti legend are improbable and it is mostly likely an origin myth suggested by the similarity of his name with Puṣkarāvati, authorizing the establishment of the Dhamma in Gandhāra in the post-Ashokan period, as well as offering a precedent for the writing down of the Dhamma. ",
  "mn140:3.4": "The Buddha addresses Pukkusāti as “mendicant” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu</i>), implicitly recognizing him as a Buddhist monk (compare <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#24.5'>MN 26:24.5</a> = <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#48.5'>MN 85:48.5</a>), while Pukkusāti uses the respectful familiar form “reverend” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>āvuso</i>).

  "mn140:8.4": "First the Buddha establishes the fundamental scope of his teaching. The elements describe the world as it is, and on them the course of meditation is based. The extension of the four elements to six hints at the practice of formless attainments. ",
  "mn140:10.1": "The “fields of contact” are the scope within which experience occurs, in response to which one becomes “preoccupied” due to the power of feeling. See note on <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn137/en/sujato#8.1'>MN 137:8.1</a>. ",
  "mn140:11.1": "Thus far we have dealt with what is in the world (the elements), how we experience the world (contact), and how we react to that experience (preoccupation with feeling).

  "mn140:11.3": "“Foundation” is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhiṭṭhāna</i>, one meaning of which is the “plinth” or “base” on which a building rests; the commentary glosses with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>patiṭṭhā</i>.
