While this is correct, the early Pali contexts are more warmly emotional than the rather austere “association”, connecting it with words such as “faith” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saddhā</i>) and ‘fondness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pema</i>) ((<a href='https://suttacentral.net/thag5.12/en/sujato#1.3'>Thag 5.12:1.3</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/thig15.1/en/sujato#14.1'>Thig 15.1:14.1</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.141/en/sujato#5.2'>AN 5.141:5.2</a>)).
