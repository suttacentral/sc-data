The commentary says he was the son of Jain parents. From the ending of this sutta, where he makes an offering of food, we can see he was not an ascetic, and from <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn36/en/sujato#48.11'>MN 36:48.11</a> it is clear he was not a Jain. | This sutta includes a number of images, phrases, and allusions that appear reminiscent of the Brahmanical teacher Uddālaka Āruṇi, although none of the references are definitive. The bulk of Uddālaka’s teachings were to his son Śvetaketu, who became arrogant due to his learning (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.1.2), paralleling Saccaka’s arrogance. ",

Shortly afterwards he inspired Sāriputta with a classic epitome of the teaching (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato#23.2.1'>Kd 1:23.2.1</a>). Note that Sāriputta waited politely until almsround was complete before approaching, whereas Saccaka just goes right ahead. We hear of a grave illness Assaji suffered later (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.88/en/sujato'>SN 22.88</a>). | Another Assaji, who is always paired with his friend Punabbasuka, was a lazy and indulgent monk (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn70/en/sujato#4.1'>MN 70:4.1</a>).

The literal sense is “with what portion”, and given the answer I think Saccaka is asking for a list of topics. ",
  "mn35:4.2": "Saccaka is addressed with the Bramanical clan name Aggivessana, probably after the lineage of his clan’s <i lang='pi' translate='no'>purohita</i>, just as the Sakyans are called Gotama and the Mallas Vāseṭṭha.

  "mn35:4.6": "Despite this, this teaching that omits “suffering” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkha</i>) is not taught by the Buddha at all. It only appears in one other sutta, where it is spoken by the mendicants after the Buddha’s passing (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato#2.2'>SN 22.90:2.2</a>; but see below at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#9.5'>MN 35:9.5</a>). Strikingly, both the current sutta and SN 22.90 share a common narrative pattern. In both cases, an interlocuter (Saccaka or Channa, both known for their conceit) asks for teaching from a lesser teacher (Assaji or unnamed mendicants). Their reply omits suffering, but this fails. So they seek a better teacher (the Buddha, Ānanda) who not only includes suffering, but specially emphasizes it (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#21.2'>MN 35:21.2</a>, <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.90/en/sujato#9.7'>SN 22.90:9.7</a>). This teaching is successful. This narrative journey mirrors that of Śvetaketu, who studied with others for twelve years before being shown true wisdom by his father Uddālaka. If we are on the right track, the point of the narrative is that it is essential to include suffering. This suggests that the Chinese parallels (SA 110 at T ii 35b4 and EA 37.10 at T ii 715b4), which do include the characteristic of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkha</i> here, would be a product of later expansion and normalization.

  "mn35:9.5": "If, as I have argued, Assaji’s presentation is meant to be inadequate, why does the Buddha endorse it here? The Buddha commonly endorses answers given by disciples, and this could have been a product of editorial standardization. After all, it remains the fact that it simply is not true that the Buddha normally teaches in this way. ",
  "mn35:10.3": "Saccaka argues by naturalistic analogy from singularity to plurality. Likewise Uddālaka, observing the natural world, pointed to the way that multiplicity emerges from singleness. When asked who he worships as self, Uddālaka answers the “earth”, which is said to be the “ground” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pratiṣṭhā</i>, Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.17); due to this worship he enjoys food and offspring. However, he points to water rather than earth as the origin of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anna</i>, which is (plant) food but also stands for solidity in general (6.2.4; see too 6.11.1–2). ",

And indeed elsewhere, such as <a href='https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato'>DN 1</a>, we find various theorists describe the self as “form”, experiencing “feelings”, being “percipient”, etc. In identifying each of the five aggregates as self, Saccaka follows the method of “affirmation” whereby multiple phenomena are affirmed to be the self at deeper and deeper levels, in contrast with the method of “negation” where potential candidates for the self are denied until the final self is revealed. Uddālaka also preferred the method of affirmation, arguing that existence comes first and that the divinity pours itself in all the manifold forms of the world (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.2.2 ff.).| Note Saccaka’s use of the term “individual person” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>purisapuggala</i>), for which see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.22/en/sujato'>SN 22.22</a> and notes.

But this would imply that the Buddha endorsed capital punishment, which is unsupported elsewhere and contradicts his ethical principles. Rather, read in its weaker literal sense, “execute those to be executed”, i.e. those who have been found guilty of a crime incurring capital punishment. It is an acknowledgment of the king’s powers, not an endorsement of them. ",
