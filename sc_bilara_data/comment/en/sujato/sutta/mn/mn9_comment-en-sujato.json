The sutta proceeds by starting with a simple analysis of right view, gradually stepping into deeper waters. Much of the discourse is framed in terms of dependent origination, but it focuses on the dependently originated phenomena, rather than the process of causality (see <a href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.20/en/sujato'>SN 12.20</a> for this distinction).

  "mn9:3.1": "That is, the deed and the motivating force behind the deed. ",
  "mn9:3.2": "Sāriputta had a deliberate, systematic, and unhurried approach to teaching. First he introduces a fundamental question, in this case stream-entry. Then he gives a simple and practical answer. Then he goes on to draw out implications both broad and deep. ",

  "mn9:8.1": "This passage, which is repeated throughout the sutta, indicates the arahant. The phrasing is problematic, as it suggests that one has right view (stream-entry) only after fully relinquishing all defilements (arahantship). The commentary records a discussion of this problem, but in fact it is probably due to a textual corruption in the Pali text, as the parallels at MA 29 and SA 344 lack this passage. This shows how difficulties in the Pali text can sometimes lead to fruitless discussions in the absence of the broader context offered by parallels. ",
  "mn9:9.2": "By giving a brief and simple answer to a profound question, Sāriputta leaves room for the audience to request further explanation. This teaching method ensures audience engagement and conveys information in digestible doses. ",

Its use as a philosophical term appears to be an innovation by the Buddha, replacing the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>anna</i> so dear to Vedic seers. ",

  "mn9:11.5": "The word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āhāra</i> (“fuel”, “food”, “nutriment”) means literally “intake”, and is etymologically parallel to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādāna</i>, “grasping”, “uptake”.

Second, rebirth is not a tangential part of the Buddha’s teachings, uncritically inherited from cultural suppositions; it is baked into the fundamental meaning of the four noble truths. | The idiom <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tatratatra</i> (literally “there, there”) is not selective (“here and there”) but distributive (“everywhere”). By taking pleasure in sense experience, the mind binds itself to the need for continued stimulation in future lives. The distancing sense “there” is important, for craving does not merely satisfy itself with what it currently experiences, but must always seek out renewed gratification. For an Upaniṣadic precursor, see the note to the same idiom at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn2/en/sujato#8.8'>MN 2:8.8</a>. ",

  "mn9:21.2": "This is a nice example of Sāriputta’s analytical genius. He picks up “old age and death” from the explanation of “suffering” and treats it within the framework of the four noble truths. This creates continuity with the previous sections, as well as situating it within the Buddha’s teachings as a whole, since all footprints fit in an elephant’s footprint (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn28/en/sujato#2.1'>MN 28:2.1</a>). Further, he <em>deepens</em> understanding by applying the four noble truths recursively, bringing small details into close focus.

Thus he simultaneously <em>broadens</em> the scope by linking the four noble truths with dependent origination. ",
  "mn9:22.2": "<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Jarā</i> is neither the process of getting old (“ageing”), nor a psychological metaphor, but the physical state of being old (“old age”). The same applies to the definitions of “death” and “rebirth”. ",

First there is the spark of an idea, a vague impression of a “park” in the mind, which solidifies into an intention. Acting on it, one goes to the park, where it becomes ones’ reality, the “world” one inhabits.
