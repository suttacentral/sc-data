  "mn119:1.1": "This discourse features the same meditation practices found under the “observation of the body” in the Satipaṭṭhānasutta ([mn10]()). ",
  "mn119:2.4": "",
  "mn119:4.7": "For “memories and thoughts tied to lay life” (_gehasitā sarasaṅkappā_) see [mn125:23.5]() and [sn54.8:5.2](). | _Sarasaṅkappā_ may be translated in two ways. Bodhi reads it as a _dvanda_ compound (“memories and thoughts”), which takes _sara_ as “memory” (Sanskrit _smara_ or _smṛti_). The commentary, followed by Ānandajoti, explains it as _dhāvanasaṅkappā_ (“rushing thoughts”), which assumes the sense “flow” (Sanskrit _saras_). Support for the _dvanda_ interpretation comes from Sanskrit texts, where we frequently find _smṛtisaṁkalpa_ as either two words (eg. Aitareya Upaniṣad 3.2) or a compound (Nyāyasūtra 4.2.34). ",
  "mn119:4.8": "Each practice leads directly to immersion, reminding us that mindfulness meditation is “the basis of immersion” (_samādhinimitta_, [mn44:12.3]()). ",
  "mn119:6.1": "Obviously this passage is not suggesting that one enters deep meditation while going to the toilet. As per the Gradual Training, such practices form a foundation that prepares the mind for meditation. ",
  "mn119:7.7": "Such meditations, as also the contemplation on death that follow, lead to immersion by ridding the mind of desire. While the subject of meditation is perceived as unpleasant, when the mind is free of desire it gives rise to a pleasure imbued with lightness and freedom, and it is that pleasure that leads to immersion. ",
  "mn119:18.1": "In the Satipaṭṭhānasutta, the practice of absorption is implicit in the contemplation of feelings (as spiritual pleasure), mind (as immersed mind, etc.), and principles (as the awakening factor of immersion), while the four absorptions are mentioned explicitly in the expanded version ([dn22:21.32]()). Here they take an even more central role. ",
  "mn119:18.2": "As a meditator proceeds, their subjective experience of the “body” evolves from tactile sense impressions (_phoṭṭhabba_), to the interior mental experience of bliss and light (_manomayakāya_), to the direct personal realization of highest truth ([mn70:23.2](): _kāyena ceva paramasaccaṁ sacchikaroti_). ",
  "mn119:18.3": "The kneading is the “placing the mind and keeping it connected”, the water is bliss, while the lack of leaking speaks to the contained interiority of the experience. ",
  "mn119:19.3": "The simile emphasizes the water as bliss, while the lack of inflow expresses containment and unification. The water welling up is the rapture, which is the uplifting emotional response to the experience of bliss. These similes are also at [dn2:78.1](), [dn10:2.16.1](), [mn39.16](), [mn77:26.3](), and [an5.28:3.4](). ",
  "mn119:20.3": "The meditator is utterly immersed in stillness and bliss. ",
  "mn119:21.3": "The white cloth is the purity and brightness of equanimity. The commentary explains this as a person who has just got out of a bath and sits perfectly dry and content. ",
  "mn119:22.1": "By this, the Buddha is asserting that mindfulness of the body is not just the first of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, but encompasses all of them. The body is the arena within which feelings, mind, and principles become apparent. (Also at [an1.575]().) | The things that “play a part in realization” are enumerated as two at [an2.31](): serenity and discernment. Another group of six at [sn55.3:4.1]() and [an6.35]() focus on the discernment side (observing impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving up, fading away, and cessation). ",
  "mn119:22.2": "A simile of the rivers becoming united in the ocean is also found at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.11, Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 3.2.8, and Praśna Upaniṣad 6.5. ",
  "mn119:24.1": "Compare [mn36:19.2]() = [mn85:19.2]() = [mn100:16.2](). ",
  "mn119:26.2": "Compare the simile at Chāndogya Upaniṣad 1.2.7, where the titans meet their end in the breath, just like being thrown against solid rock. ",
  "mn119:28.1": "These similes recall the absorption similes above. ",
  "mn119:29.5": "The phrase _sati sati āyatane_ is tricky. Syntactically, it is a locative absolute construction, which Bodhi treats as conditional: “there being a suitable basis”. However this does not readily account for the repeated _sati_, which he takes as the locative present participle from the verb _atthi_ (“being”). Ānandajoti, by contrast, takes the first _sati_ as “being” and the second as “mindfulness”, and treats the absolute construction as temporal: “while there is a basis for mindfulness”. Further, both accept the commentary’s gloss of _āyatana_ as _kāraṇa_ (“reason, basis”), although this sense of _āyatana_ is rare in the suttas (but see [sn12.25:14.3]() = [an4.171:5.3]()). These readings of the absolute construction give it a limiting sense; the benefits apply only insofar as there is a “suitable basis” or a “basis for mindfulness”. But the expression is used by the Buddha of himself ([an5.68:1.9]()), so it seems odd that it would be limiting. Indeed, the tenor of the whole sentence is not limiting but expansive, as emphasized by the repeated reduplications: _yassa yassa … tatra tatreva … sati sati_, which have a distributive sense. I therefore take _sati_ as “being” in both cases; the reduplication of _sati_ as aligned with the preceding pronouns, emphasizing universality; the locative absolute as causal; and _āyatana_  in its normal sense of “scope, range”.
