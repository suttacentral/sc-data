  "mn129:1.1": "This discourse is a fundamental statement on the role of kamma. It identifies a fool with one who acts badly, and describes the suffering that awaits them in this life and the next. An astute person who acts well, by contrast, will experience countless joys. ",

  "mn129:10.1": "The Buddhist traditions were uncomfortable with the idea that the “wardens of hell” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nirayapāla</i>) are sentient beings, since this would imply that they are not merely working off the results of their own bad deeds, but actively creating new bad kamma by tormenting others. The commentary cites “certain elders” who argue that there are no wardens of hell because kamma works “like a machine” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>yantarūpaṁ viya</i>). These elders are probably the Mahāsaṅghikas of Andhra who, according to the commentary on <a href='https://suttacentral.net/kv20.3/en/sujato'>Kv 20.3</a>, say the torments are inflicted by the deeds themselves in the form of wardens of hell. The Theravadin commentator responds by analogy, since there are those who inflict punishment in the human realm. The situation was comparable in northern Indian Buddhism, for Vasubandhu at Abhidharmakośabhāṣya 3.59a–c cites a number of opinions on both sides. In his Viṁśikā vv. 4–7 and commentary he makes his own position clear, arguing that the wardens are mental projections, not sentient beings. ",
