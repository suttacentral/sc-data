  "mn46:20.1": "Rancid urine was the worst of medicines, used when nothing better was available. Specifically, the Vinaya allows it as a purgative in the case of snakebite (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#14.6.4'>Kd 6:14.6.4</a>), and gives chebulic myrobalan soaked in cattle urine as a remedy for jaundice (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/sujato#14.7.9'>Kd 6:14.7.9</a>). Modern research has shown that urine, far from being a sterile cure-all, contains <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3032614/'>dangerous</a> levels of <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957746/'>bacterial pathogens</a>, and has <a href='https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/03/29/fact-check-drinking-urine-carries-health-risks-no-sight-benefits/11561019002/'>no  medicinal value</a>.

  "mn46:22.2": "This text as well as <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn45/en/sujato#7.9'>MN 45:7.9</a> answer the question of what practice results in future happiness, and so do not consider awakening. It is surprising to see such bold praise for such a modest teaching. The Chinese parallels to these suttas have the inverse situation, as they describe a practice leading to non-return (MA 174 at T i 712b27) or Nibbana (MA 175 at T i 712c25, T 83 at T i 902c10), yet do not have this passage of praise.
