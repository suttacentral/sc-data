  "mn42:1.1": "This discourse is identical with the previous except for the location, and a very slight difference in phrasing at <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn42/en/sujato#7.1'>MN 42:7.1</a> compared to <a href='https://suttacentral.net/mn41/en/sujato#7.1'>MN 41:7.1</a>. The Chinese parallels (SA 1042 and SA 1043 at T ii 272c-273b) are also nearly identical to each other, sharing the same location (Sāvatthī), and varying only in the names of the brahmins and their manner of approaching the Buddha.

  "mn42:2.1": "Verañjā has not been conclusively identified, but it lay between Madhurā (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.53/en/sujato#1.1'>AN 4.53:1.1</a>) and Soreyya (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#4.18'>Bu Pj 1:4.18</a>). If modern Soron is Soreyya, it is tempting to accept Dhammika’s identification of Verañjā with Atranjikhera (<a href='https://suttacentral.net/note to [pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/sujato#4.18'>NOTE TO [Bu Pj 1:4.18</a>) just north of Etah in Uttar Pradesh. Atranjikhera is a huge mound whose excavation revealed four layers of occupation, the latest of which was the Northern Black Polished Ware culture of the Buddha’s day. It was a staging ground for horse traders from Kasmir along the northern route from Kashmir, which more or less followed the course of the Ganges. ",
