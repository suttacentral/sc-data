  "mn17:2.1": "This sutta acts as a counterbalance to the many places where the Buddha encourages living secluded in the forest. The purpose of the life of solitude is to develop meditation and find freedom. But life is complicated and people are complicated, and sometimes what we think will support us becomes a hindrance.

  "mn17:7-10.1": "In the remaining cases I translate <i lang='pi' translate='no'>upanissaya</i> as “supported by”. ",
