  "mn60:1.1": "This sutta subverts the imagery of gambling by reasoning towards logical certitude in a world of apparently random chances. Gambling was a major feature of Vedic culture, with the moving confession of Rig Veda 10.34 recounting the thrill and loss of the game. The gods were invoked to ensure success (Atharvaveda 7.109). Even kings bowed to the dice (Rig Veda 10.34.8), so that the Rājasūya consecration ceremony is secured with a (loaded) game of dice (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6, 23). Numerous tales of kings losing their realms at dice, most notably Yudhiṣṭhira in the Mahābhārata, show that the power and danger of gambling was not merely symbolic. ",

  "mn60:4.1": "The Brahmanical community was in a period of questioning and transition, with multiple different perspectives offered by both Brahmins and ascetics. ",
  "mn60:4.3": "While the contextual sense of the key term <i lang='pi' translate='no'>apaṇṇaka</i> (“unfailing”) is clear, the etymology has proven a puzzle. I propose that it is a gambling term, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paṇṇa</i> appears as a form of the number five. While a set of four dice was “perfect”, the fifth “losing” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>kali</i>) die was all-powerful, since just one extra die meant you lose everything (Rig Veda 10.34.2, Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 5.4.4.6). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Apaṇṇaka</i> is therefore literally a “set without a fifth” and metaphorically “without fail”.

  "mn60:9.2": "Given that they no longer exist, how are they safe? Bodhi’s “will have made himself safe” is unlikely, as it is future perfect, a rare sense that requires the past participle. Anyway he hasn’t “made himself” anything, he just happen to live in a world without moral consequences. Horner notes the problem without offering a solution, there are no parallels, and commentaries are silent. I think the text is corrupt. ",
  "mn60:9.4": "The syntax of this sentence is tricky. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kāmaṁ</i> is “willingly”, which together with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hotu</i> conveys the sense “let us grant …”. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Māhu</i> resolves to <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mā ahu</i>, a simple negation rather than a prohibition.
