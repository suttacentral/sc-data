  "mn36:3.1": "This discourse appears to be set after the previous. In both suttas, while Saccaka is impressed by the Buddha, he does not go for refuge or indicate that he has been persuaded by his teachings. ",
  "mn36:4.1": "“Physical endurance” is _kāyabhāvanā_, which is not a normal Buddhist term. It is introduced by Saccaka here and collected in [dn33:1.10.117](). ",
  "mn36:4.3": "",
  "mn36:4.4": "",
  "mn36:5.3": "Described as prominent sages of the Ājīvakas at [mn76:53.6]() and [an6.57:7.1](). Gosāla was one of the oft-mentioned six ascetic teachers (see below [mn36:48.7]()), while the other two are unknown outside of these passing mentions. But the phrasing of this passage suggests that they too, like Gosāla, were contemporaries of the Buddha. ",
  "mn36:6.1": "",
  "mn36:6.4": "",
  "mn36:6.7": "While pre-Buddhist texts describe a contemplative and reflective culture, they do not contain clear instructions for meditation. It seems that the practice of explicitly teaching meditation methods was an innovation of the Buddha. ",
  "mn36:10.3": "This is a standard response to someone making unwarranted assumptions about personal spiritual development ([an3.60:18.1](), [an4.35:5.1](), [mn127:17.8]()). ",
  "mn36:10.5": "The Buddha is not speaking about enlightenment, but about his determination to persevere. ",
  "mn36:11.1": "For the idiom _na hi nūna_, compare [an8.86:5.3]() and [an4.67:2.1](). ",

  "mn36:17.1": "Also at [mn85:15.1]() and [mn100:14.1](). These similes, which illustrate the importance of detachment from sensual pleasures and the uselessness of fervent austerities, would fit better below, after the austerities and before _jhāna_ ([mn36:30.1]()). A parallel to this passage preserved in a fragmentary Sanskrit manuscript of the Dīrgha Āgama does indeed place these similes there, while other parallels vary the content or position of the similes to a degree. ",
  "mn36:17.5": "",
  "mn36:17.6": "_Abhimanthento_ must be “drilling” rather than “rubbing”, which does not produce fire. See too the simile of the man “drilling” into the head below ([mn36:22.5]()). ",
  "mn36:20.2": "This, the most gentle of the austere practices, was occasionally recommended by the Buddha as a last resort ([mn20:7.2]()). ",
  "mn36:20.7": "",
  "mn36:31.2": "The gentle and pleasant practice of _jhāna_ is contrasted with the fiery austerities. The Bodhisatta had previously developed meditation under his former teachers, which included the practice of _jhāna_. But there the practice was embedded in theory, since he first memorized scripture, which would have taught him that such states were a revelation of the true self as the cosmic divinity of sheer consciousness. Thus what he rejected was “that teaching”, i.e. the system of philosophy and practice as a whole, which leads only to rebirth in a refined realm. Now he recalls entering deep meditation with the innocence of youth, following no system or philosophy. This showed him that peace of mind is a natural process of letting go, not dependent on (Upaniṣadic) metaphysics. ",
  "mn36:31.5": "Compare [dhp274:1](). ",
  "mn36:33.2": "The dependence of the mind on food was proven by Uddālaka when he asked Śvetaketu to go without food for fifteen days, after which he could not recall any of the hymns (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.7). ",

  "mn36:45.8": "Here Saccaka reveals his bad faith; he is more interested in trapping the Buddha than in learning. ",
  "mn36:46.2": "He deflects to others, as he also did at [mn35:11.4](). ",
  "mn36:48.11": "This shows that despite his Jain parentage, and despite his citation of Ājīvakas above, Saccaka was no adherent of these philosophies. It seems that he was a contrarian at heart. "
