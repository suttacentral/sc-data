His name is obscure; spelled _caṅgī_ in Sanskrit, it is perhaps related to the _gatāgate caṅgimā_ of Mahā-subhāṣita-Saṁgraha 7235-1, where it refers to the sensual walk of a young woman; dictionaries record the sense “beautiful” for Kannada _caṁgi_ and Sanskrit _caṅgiman_. | “Royal park” is _rājadāya_ (cp. _migadāya_, “deer park”). | A _brahmadeyya_ is a gift of land by a king to a brahmin, which was an outstanding feature of Indian feudalism.

  "mn95:11.2": "This student’s education is like that of Assalāyana ([mn93:3.1]()), but his character could not be more different. His name has a variety of spellings in Pali and Sanskrit, but the correct form is _kāpaṭika_ from _kapaṭa_, “fraud”. Kauṭilya explains that fraudulent students (_chātraḥ kāpaṭikaḥ_) were spies installed by kings to test the loyalty of subjects (Arthaśāstra 1.10.11, 1.11.1–2), for which they were paid handsomely (5.3.22). Note that the Buddha calls him Bhāradvāja; this follows the convention in Pali that brahmins of that name are distinguished by epithets, often unflattering: Bhāradvāja the Farmer ([snp1.4:1.3]()), Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper ([snp1.7:1.4]()), Bhāradvāja the Alms-Gatherer ([sn35.127:1.1]()), Bhāradvāja the Builder ([sn7.17:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Rude ([sn7.2:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Fiend ([sn7.3:1.2]()), Bhāradvāja the Bitter ([sn7.4:1.2]()), and so on. Thus Kāpaṭika would have been an epithet recognizing that he was the king’s spy, a practice to which Pasenadi openly admits ([sn3.11:7.1](), [ud6.2:8.1]()). This was the downside of building a religious institution on the king’s largess. Whether he was recognized as a spy at the time, or the epithet was applied later, is uncertain, but at some point it seems the meaning was forgotten and the epithet was taken to be his proper name.
