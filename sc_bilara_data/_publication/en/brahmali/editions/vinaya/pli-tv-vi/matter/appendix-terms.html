<h1>Appendix I: Technical Terms</h1>
<p>The discussion in this appendix focuses on words that in previous Vinaya translations have not been properly understood or only understood in part. As such, I do not give all relevant meanings of a particular word, but focus on those aspects where I propose a new, improved, or additional understanding. In some cases, I also discuss historical developments and try to discern to what extent the meaning of certain words has changed over time. The focus is on core Vinaya terminology.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Akuppa</i>: “irreversible”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aggaḷa</i>: “door”</h3>
<p>I. B. Horner translates <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> as “bolt”,<sup><a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-1' id='introduction-noteref-1' role='doc-noteref'>1</a></sup> as does Bhikkhu Bodhi in the “Numerical Discourses of the Buddha”, yet it is far from clear that this is the correct rendering. In several places, the Vinaya Piṭaka has a list of door appurtenances. This list includes a detailed description of things that pertain to doors: a door panel (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>kavāṭa</i>), a lintel (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭṭha</i>),<sup><a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-2' id='introduction-noteref-2' role='doc-noteref'>2</a></sup> door posts (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭa</i>), a lower hinge (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>udukkhalika</i>), an upper hinge (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>uttarapāsaka</i>), a door jamb (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷavaṭṭi</i>), a bolt eye (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>kapisīsaka</i>), a bolt (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>sūcika</i>), a lockable bolt (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>ghaṭika</i>), a keyhole (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>tāḷacchidda</i>), a door-pulling hole (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>āviñchanacchidda</i>), and a door-pulling rope (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>āviñchanarajju</i>). <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aggaḷa</i>, however, is conspicuously absent. This makes it unlikely that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> should simply be equated with “bolt” or any other basic part of a door, especially since the above list contains two words that specifically mean bolt, namely, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sūcika</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ghaṭika</i>.</p>
<p>Another possible meaning for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> is “door”, as suggested by DOP. Let us have a look at some relevant contexts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Monks, imagine a light ball of thread placed on an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i>-plank made entirely of heartwood.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn119/en/sujato#26.2">MN 119:26.2</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is hard to imagine that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> could have anything to do with a bolt. That it should refer to a door, however, makes good sense, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷaphalake</i> would then mean something like a “door-panel.”</p>
<p>At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc19/en/brahmali#2.1.9">Bu Pc 19</a> <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷaṭṭhapanāya</i> is glossed as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dvāraṭṭhapanāya</i>. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dvāra</i> unambiguously means “gate” or “door”, and so that must be the meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> too, at least in this context.</p>
<p>Then we have the fairly common expression <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷaṁ ākoteti</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having entered the porch, having coughed, he knocked the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i>. The Buddha opened the door. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#1.9.1">DN 3:1.9.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To translate this as “knocking (on) the door-bolt,” as I. B. Horner does, is not meaningful. “Knocking on the door/door-panel”, however, is straightforward.</p>
<p>The commentaries support this understanding of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷaṁ ākoṭesi</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> is the door in the doorway.<sup><a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-3' id='introduction-noteref-3' role='doc-noteref'>3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Knocking on the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> means apply a sign on the door with the tip of the nails.<sup><a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-4' id='introduction-noteref-4' role='doc-noteref'>4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Knocking on the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> means knocking on the door-panel with the tip of the nails.<sup><a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-5' id='introduction-noteref-5' role='doc-noteref'>5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At MN 21 we have the compound <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷasūci</i>, translated by Ñāṇamoli and Bodhi in the “Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha” as “rolling-pin,” but it is hard to see how they might justify this. We have seen above that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sūci</i>, when used in conjunction with doors, means “bolt”. If <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> too means “bolt”, the compound would not make sense. If <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> means door, then an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷasūci</i> would be a “door-bolt.” This fits with the story in MN 21, where Mistress Vedehikā hits her servant Kālī on the head and causes her to bleed.</p>
<p>If we take <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> to mean a door or a door-panel, this also makes sense in the use of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> as a patch of cloth, as found in the non-offense clause to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc58/en/brahmali#2.3.6">Bu Pc 58</a> and in the Chapter on Robes at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#14.1.9">Kd 8:14.1.9</a>. A patch and a panel have much in common, in that they both cover a hole. This explains the shared name. On the other hand, there is no obvious reason a patch and a bolt would share a name.</p>
<p>I conclude from the above that “door” or “door-panel” is the main meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> in the Vinaya Piṭaka. There are a few more references to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> that I have not mentioned, but they do not add much to the above. The only exception is the compound <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷaguttivihāro</i>, “a dwelling kept safe by an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i>.” In this case the obvious meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> is “bolt” or “lock.” But even here it could refer to a door, with the existence of a bolt/lock being implied.</p>
<p>It is this last usage of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> which perhaps gives us the final clue to its meaning. I would suggest the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> is a complete door, including all the parts that go into a door. This is why <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> does not appear as a separate part in the list quoted above. This is also why there is no need to mention the lock when a hut is said to be guarded by an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i>—the lock is implied. In contrast, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kavāṭa</i> refers to a door-panel, and as such it is included in the door-part list. And a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dvāra</i> is a door in the sense of a door-way. It includes grand “doors” such as gates and gateways found at the entry points to villages and towns.</p>
<p>So <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggaḷa</i> means “door.” If it ever means “bolt,” this is no more than an extended meaning. It makes sense that this fairly rare word should only have a single overarching meaning rather than two quite distinct ones.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aggisālā</i>: “water-boiling shed”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aggisālā</i> literally means “a fire shed”. The nature of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggisālā</i> is not clear from the Canonical texts, the term being found almost exclusively in lists of buildings and stock passages. We need to turn to the commentaries to get a clearer view.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After boiling dye outside, the dye-vessel, the dye-ladle, and the dye-trough should all be put away in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggisālā</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-6' id='introduction-noteref-6' role='doc-noteref'>6</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aggisālā</i>: the shed for boiling with a fire.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-7' id='introduction-noteref-7' role='doc-noteref'>7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests that the purpose of this building was to boil water, for instance to dye cloth. Occasionally <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggisālā</i> can also refer to a “fire hut”, as used by ascetics who tended the sacred fire, as in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#15.6.4">Kd 1:15.5.4</a>.</p>
<p>See also entry on <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aṅgula</i>: “fingerbreadth”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Ajjhokāsa/abbhokāsa</i>: “out in the open”, “outside”</h3>
<p>Both DOP and CPD give “the open air” for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ajjhokāsa</i>, which suggests it just means outdoors. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Ajjhokāsa</i>, however, is regularly contrasted with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>rukkhamūla</i>, “the foot of a tree”. A particularly telling juxtaposition is found in the Chapter on Entering the Rainy-season Residence (Kd 3):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At one time monks entered the rains residence <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ajjhokāsa</i>. When it was raining, they ran for cover under trees (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>rukkhamūla</i>) and eaves. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#12.5.1">Kd 3:12.5.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from this that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ajjhokāsa</i> is opposed to “under cover” and must therefore mean “out in the open”. In some contexts, however, “outside” seems to be a better rendering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, after spending much of the night <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ajjhokāsa</i>, the Buddha entered the dwelling … (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali#13.9.1">Kd 5:13.9.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I vary my translation accordingly.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aḍḍhayoga:</i> “stilt house”</h3>
<p>In the Vinaya Piṭaka, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aḍḍhayoga</i> is normally grouped with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hammiya</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>. According to the commentaries, all three buildings are different kinds of “stilt houses”. Rather than try to differentiate between them, which is not necessary from a practical perspective, I have grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“An <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aḍḍhayoga</i> is a house bent like a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>supaṇṇa</i>.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-8' id='introduction-noteref-8' role='doc-noteref'>8</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A house bent like a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>supaṇṇa</i>: a house made in the shape of the wings of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garuḷa</i>.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-9' id='introduction-noteref-9' role='doc-noteref'>9</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garuḷa</i>, better known in its Sanskrit form <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garuḍa</i>, is a mythological bird. The commentary continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> is a long stilt house. A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hammiya</i> is just a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-10' id='introduction-noteref-10' role='doc-noteref'>10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Sp-ṭ 3.74 we find slightly different explanations. It is clear, however, that all three are stilt houses that are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. See also <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> in this same Appendix.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Anujānāti</i>: “should”, “to instruct”</h3>
<p>This verb ranges in meaning from “allowing” to “requiring”. Here are a couple of examples to illustrate this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We allow Sudinna to go forth from home to homelessness.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#5.4.8">Bu Pj 1:5.4.8</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The context—parents allowing a young man to go forth—makes it clear that this must be an allowance. With the following example, however, it is equally clearly a requirement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Monks, you should recite the Monastic Code.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#3.2.4">Kd 2:3.2.4</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no clear cut-off point between the two meanings, one tending to segue into the other. The only aid to decide which meaning is appropriate is context. I vary my translation from “to allow” to “to instruct”, but often I just use “should” plus a main verb. The “should” represents <i translate='no' lang='pli'>anujānāti</i>, whereas the main verb represents the action that is either prescribed or proscribed.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Antepura/rājantepura</i>: “royal compound”</h3>
<p>Some of the best evidence for the meaning of this word comes from <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83/en/brahmali#0.5">Bu Pc 83</a>. According to the origin story to this rule, the following things relate to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>rājantepura</i>: a harem, secret deliberations, a father longing for his son, someone being promoted/demoted, the army being dispatched, and the trampling of elephants, horses, and chariots. This is more than a mere royal residence. It seems to suggest the seat of government and perhaps a little town in its own right.</p>
<p>This picture is supported by evidence from other passages. Criminals are sentenced in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i>, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#43.1.2">Kd 1:43.1.2</a>); the king’s home is only one building among many inside the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i>, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#1.13.15">Kd 8:1.13.15</a>); a carriage reaches the gate of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i>, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn24/en/sujato#14.11">MN 24:14.11</a>); the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i> seems to be a place within a town, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#1.6.8">Kd 17:1.6.8</a>); the King’s assembly is seated in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i>, (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.60/en/sujato#7.5">AN 3.60:7.5</a>).</p>
<p>Then there is the compound <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uparipāsādavaragata</i>, “ascended (his) finest stilt house”, normally referring to kings. If the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i> is a whole compound, then presumably it included a number of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i>, “stilt houses”, one of which may have been the best one, perhaps the king’s favorite.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fact that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i> had a gate would seem to mean that it was a clearly defined area, perhaps surrounded by walls or at least a fence. According to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83/en/brahmali#1.2.11,%20monastics%20would%20not%20normally%20go%20for%20alms%20to%20the%20%3Ci%20translate='no'%20lang='pli'%3Eantepura%3C/i%3E">Bu Pc 83:1.2.11</a>, yet they would go for alms in Sāvatthī. From this it would again appear that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i> was a compound within a city, which fits the literal meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antepura</i>, “within the city”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Abbhantara</i></h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Amagga</i>: “mouth”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Āpadā</i>: “emergency”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Āpadā</i> is essentially the opposite of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sampadā</i>, “success”, “accomplishment”, “good fortune”, etc., and as such it might be rendered as “misfortune”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āpadā</i> points to external dangers and stressful situations. Possible renderings are “times of distress” or “difficult circumstance”. In the non-offense clauses of the Sutta-vibhaṅga, however, which is where this word is most commonly found, the meaning is closer to an immediate danger that stops you from taking a normally required action. Examples include a monastic who is unable to put away furniture before departing because of an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āpadā</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc14/en/brahmali#2.3.7">Bu Pc 14:2.3.7</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15/en/brahmali#2.3.8">Bu Pc 15:2.3.8</a>), and 73 out of the 75 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sekhiya</i> rules on proper behaviors, which need not be adhered to when there is an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āpadā</i>. The idea of an immediate danger is best captured by “emergency”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Ārāma: “</i>a park”, “a monastery”</h3>
<p>“Park” is the more fundamental meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ārāma</i>. However, since such parks were sometimes given to the Sangha to serve as monasteries, the monasteries, too, became known by the same name. It is the latter meaning which predominates in the Vinaya Piṭaka.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Upacāra</i>: “access”, “vicinity”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Upacāra</i>, which is composed of the root <i translate='no' lang='pli'>car</i>, “move”, and the prefix <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upa</i>, “toward”, can perhaps most comprehensively be rendered as “approach”. The word “approach” has the benefit of encompassing two common translations of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i>, “vicinity” and “access”. Ideally, we would use “approach” for all contexts of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i>. For practical application, however, “approach” may not be precise enough to convey the contextual meaning in any given Pali passage.</p>
<p>In the Vinaya Piṭaka, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> is mostly used in conjunction with physical spaces. As a matter of common sense, “vicinity” fits better whenever <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> relates to an “unenclosed” space, whereas “access” fits better with “enclosed” spaces. The Canonical text aligns well with this understanding, with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> as “access” referring specifically to the entryway through an enclosure. This is the word definition at Bu Pj 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> to an inhabited area: of an enclosed inhabited area: the stone-throw of a man of average height standing at the threshold of the gateway to the inhabited area; of an unenclosed inhabited area: the stone-throw of a man of average height standing at the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> to a house. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#3.7">Bu Pj 2:3.7</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is what the commentary says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enclosed: … It is to this extent that the state of having a single <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> for a one-clan village is shown. … Unenclosed: with this the state of having many <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāras</i> for that same village is shown.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-11' id='introduction-noteref-11' role='doc-noteref'>11</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary is here making the case that an unenclosed inhabited area has as many <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāras</i> as there are houses. However, there are rules such as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np29/en/brahmali#2.9">Bu NP 29</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15/en/brahmali#2.1.19">Bu Pc 15</a> where a village or monastery is said to have one <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> (singular). To serve us better in such rules, it seems reasonable to regard the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> of an unenclosed inhabited area as the sum of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāras</i> to the individual houses, that is, as the “vicinity” of the inhabited area. Given that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> spans the meanings “access” and “vicinity”, we are probably justified in using both terms, choosing the appropriate one according to context.</p>
<p>There are a few contexts where neither of the above two renderings is satisfactory, for instance in the cases of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dassan’ūpacāra</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>savan’ūpacāra</i>., e.g. in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc42/en/brahmali#2.1.15">Bu Pc 42</a>. In these cases, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upacāra</i> refers to what is accessible by sight or by hearing, literally, “seeing access” and “hearing access”. To bring out this meaning in idiomatic English, I render these as “within (the range of) sight/hearing”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Uposatha</i>: “observance-day ceremony”</h3>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> is the day of religious observance. On this day the monastic community meets to recite the monastic rules, whereas lay Buddhists often go to a monastery to keep the eight precepts and to listen to teachings. This ancient practice is described both in the Suttas and the Vinaya Piṭaka. My most general rendering of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> is therefore “observance day”.</p>
<p>“To do the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposathaṁ karoti</i>, refers the act of reciting the monastic rules. Although the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, together with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> (“invitation”) ceremony, has historically been considered a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, a monastic legal procedure, this may not have been the case when it was first instituted, as can be seen from the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’re excluded from the observance-day ceremony, from the invitation ceremony, and from the legal procedures of the Sangha.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8/en/brahmali#3.1.4">Bu Ss 8:3.1.4</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar distinction between the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is found here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“From today on, Ānanda, I’ll do the observance-day ceremony and the legal procedures of the Sangha separate from the Buddha and the Sangha of monks.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#3.17.4">Kd 17:3.17.4</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both these cases, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> is placed side-by-side with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, suggesting that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> was not regarded as a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, or at least as a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> with special significance. Moreover, according to the Chapter on the Observance Day, even groups of less than four monastics, down to a single monk or nun, are said to do the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#26.2.5">Kd 2:26.2.5</a>–26.9.4). This cannot refer to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> proper since legal procedures require a minimum of four monastics. For these reasons I do not render the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> proceedings as “observance-day (legal) procedure”, but rather as “observance-day ceremony”. Only when <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> are used together in the single compound <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposathakamma</i>, which may well be a later development, do I render the combination as “observance-day procedure”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Ubhatobyañjanaka</i>: “hermaphrodite”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Ubhatobyañjanaka</i>, literally, “one who has both characteristics”, is a reference to a person who has both male and female genitalia. Exactly what is meant by this in a Vinaya context is debatable. It does not seem to be equivalent to what we now term an intersex person.</p>
<p>The term is not found in Sutta Piṭaka and only rarely in the Vinaya Piṭaka. Almost all references are found in contexts that are likely to be relatively late, especially passages that set out elaborate permutation series, such as in Bu Pj 1 or in Kd 9.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-12' id='introduction-noteref-12' role='doc-noteref'>12</a> Bhikkhu*nī Vimala, in the essay Yellow Gate, judges the term to be a relatively late addition to the Vinaya Piṭaka, possibly added at the second Council, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅgīti</i>. It seems unlikely that the Buddha himself used the term.</p>
<p>For an explanation of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> we need to turn to the commentaries. The main explanation is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘<i translate='no' lang='pli'>Ubhatobyañjanaka</i>’ means: because of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> giving rise to female characteristics and because of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> giving rise to male characteristics, they have the characteristics of both. ‘Had sex’ means: with the male characteristic they act to transgress through sexual intercourse with women. ‘Made others have it’ means: having encouraged another, they cause action in their own female characteristic.</p>
<p>They are twofold: the female <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> and the male <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i>. In regard to this, the female characteristic of the female <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> is apparent, but the male characteristic is hidden. The male characteristic of the male <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> is apparent, but the female characteristic is hidden.</p>
<p>When the female <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> is acting with manliness among women, the female characteristic is hidden, whereas the male characteristic is apparent. When the male <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> takes on the state of a woman for the sake of men, the male characteristic is hidden, whereas the female characteristic is apparent. The female <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> both becomes pregnant and causes others to become pregnant. The male <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> does not become pregnant, but causes others to become pregnant. This is the difference between them.</p>
<p>But in the Kurundi it is said: ‘If male characteristics should occur in the rebirth-link, then female characteristics appear at rebirth, and if female characteristics should occur in the rebirth-link, then male characteristics appear at rebirth.’ In regard to this, as to the details, it is to be understood according to the Atthasālinī, the commentary on the Dhammasaṅgaṇī. And for this twofold <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> there is no going forth, nor full ordination. This is to be understood here.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-13' id='introduction-noteref-13' role='doc-noteref'>13</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which the sub-commentary adds the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For both <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanakas</i>, when lust for a woman arises, then the male characteristic is apparent, whereas the other is hidden, and when lust for a man arises, then the female characteristic is apparent, whereas the other is hidden.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-14' id='introduction-noteref-14' role='doc-noteref'>14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems clear from this explanation that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> is a mythological rather than real person. People such as the ones described above are not found in nature. It is impossible for a single person to both impregnate and be impregnated.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-15' id='introduction-noteref-15' role='doc-noteref'>15</a> Moreover, the idea that the sexual characteristics of the person change dependent on who they lust for is hard to make sense of.</p>
<p>Bhikkhu*nī Vimala argues persuasively that the Buddhist texts inherited the idea of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> (but not the word) from the contemporary Indian culture, especially the Vedas. In this culture the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> was mythological rather than real. The Buddhists, as can be seen from the commentarial extracts above, inherited this mythological understanding. For this reason, it is difficult to see how the rule prohibiting <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanakas</i> from the full ordination could ever be applied to real candidates.</p>
<p>In sum, I render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> as “hermaphrodite”, a term that is now considered archaic in describing humans. I use this term to give an approximation of the meaning, while suggesting that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanaka</i> does not actually exist.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kathina</i>: “a (robe-making) frame”, “the robe-making ceremony”, “the robe season”</h3>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> is a frame that was used for sewing robes at the time of the Buddha. Rules relating to this frame are found in Kd 15, the Khuddakavatthu-kkhandhaka, the Chapter on Minor Topics. I render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> as “frame” only in the context of this chapter.</p>
<p>In other contexts, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> is used largely metaphorically. Rather than rendering <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> as “frame” in these instances—since the metaphor would normally be lost on a modern audience—I translate according to the verb it is associated with. When <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> is used with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>attharati</i>—literally, “to cover the (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i>) frame”—the implied meaning is to do the robe-making ceremony, commonly referred to as the “kathina ceremony”, whereby the robe season is extended. I then translate it as “(to perform/to participate in) the robe-making ceremony”. And when <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> is used with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddharati</i> or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubbharati</i>—literally, “to remove the (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i>) frame”—the implied meaning is to end the robe season, and I translate accordingly.</p>
<p>This rendering of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> + <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddharati/ubbharati</i> needs a bit more explanation. The robe season, properly known as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvarakālasamaya</i>, begins when the rainy season retreat finishes, and ends either one month later or, if one participates in the robe-making ceremony, at the end of the cold season, four months later. The purpose of the so-called “removal of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> frame” is in fact to end the robe season. Again, since the literal expression is now largely meaningless, I translate according to the purpose.</p>
<p>Although the robe-making ceremony includes a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, a monastic legal procedure, this is no more than the initial step of an extended process. The purpose of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is to formally bestow a cloth given by lay supporters on an individual monk or nun. The next step in the ceremony is the sewing of the robe from that cloth, upon the completion of which the recipient declares that the ceremony has been done. Finally, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> participants individually express their appreciation for the properly performed ceremony. This is the process in outline. Because the ceremony has so many steps, it would be inaccurate to render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> + <i translate='no' lang='pli'>attharati</i> as “(to do) the robe-making legal procedure”. A broader expression such as “robe-making ceremony” is required.</p>
<p>There are two additional complications. First, because of the slightly different roles, as seen above, played by those involved in the ceremony, I render the various forms of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> + <i translate='no' lang='pli'>attharati</i> a little differently depending on the context. The person who is chosen to receive the robe “performs the robe-making ceremony”, whereas all the other monastics who take part in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> and the expression of appreciation “participate in the robe-making ceremony”. In the Parivāra the performance and the participation are sometimes grouped together, in which case I still use the expression “to participate in the robe-making ceremony”.</p>
<p>Second, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> is also used apart from the three verbs mentioned above (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>attharati</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uddharati</i>, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubbharati</i>), sometimes compounded with another word, for instance, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathinānujānanā</i>, “the allowance for a robe-making ceremony”. The meaning of the word in these instances is generally as if it was used in conjunction with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>attharati</i>. I translate accordingly.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kilāsa</i>: “mild leprosy”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kilāsa</i> is closely related to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuṭṭha</i> (leprosy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kilāsa</i> is leprosy without lesions, without discharge, and with the color of red and white lotuses.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-16' id='introduction-noteref-16' role='doc-noteref'>16</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems modern medical science distinguishes between <em>tuberculoid leprosy</em>, which is mild and has few lesions, and <em>lepromatous leprosy</em>, which is severe and has widespread lesions. It seems plausible to identify <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kilāsa</i> with the former and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuṭṭha</i> with the latter. But to avoid the technical Latinate medical vocabulary, I render them respectively as “mild leprosy” and “leprosy”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kuṭṭha</i>: “leprosy”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kilāsa</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kuppa</i>: “reversible”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kuppa</i> is a future passive participle derived from the verb <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppati</i>, “is disturbed”. The participle means something like “can be disturbed” or “disturbable”. The meaning of the negative participle <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akuppa</i> is well established, since it occurs in a common <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sutta</i> context: <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akuppa me vimutti</i>, often translated as “my liberation is unshakeable”. In this context <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akuppa</i> means that the liberation is firm and irreversible. There seems to be no reason why <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akuppa</i> should not mean the same in the Vinaya Piṭaka, that is, an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akuppa saṅghakamma</i> is a legal procedure of the Sangha that cannot be disturbed. In other words, it is valid and irreversible.</p>
<p>While the meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akuppa</i> is straightforward, the same is not true of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i>. Being the antonym of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akuppa</i>, it would seem that “reversible” would be a suitable rendering. Yet there is a good reason to question this, namely that the general Vinaya context suggests otherwise.</p>
<p>According to the Vinaya, a legal procedure, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, is either valid or invalid, depending on whether a certain number of technical conditions has been fulfilled. If it is valid, the procedure stands and is therefore “irreversible”. If it is invalid, then it is as if the procedure was never done. There is no need to reverse it or undo it, because by definition an invalid procedure is equivalent to a procedure that has not been performed at all. Thus, to translate <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i> as “reversible” is misleading, because the invalidity or otherwise is already established. When all the facts of a legal procedure are known and undisputed, there can never be any reversibility.</p>
<p>So perhaps it would be better to render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i> as “invalid”, as suggested in DOP. This would fit perfectly with how the validity of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is normally understood and would leave out the awkward “reversible”, which does not fit the broader Vinaya context.</p>
<p>Yet, there are at least two serious problems with this. The first is that there is no evidence that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i>, or the related verb <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppati</i>, ever means “invalid”. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kuppati</i> means “to disturb” or “to shake”, for which “reversible” is a good fit. “Disturbable” sends a different message from “invalid”. Unless absolutely demanded by the context, we need to be careful not to impose artificial meanings on words.</p>
<p>The second problem is that although the broader Vinaya context does not seem to allow for the meaning “reversible”, in a narrower context this meaning may in fact be quite apt. In the context of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i> is almost always used together with the synonym <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṭṭhān’āraha</i>. This latter word means “not worthy of remaining” or “not fit to stand”. Rather than referring to “invalidity”, the implication of this word is that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> actually is valid, but that it should be objected to and annulled. Another important synonym for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i> is <i translate='no' lang='pli'>adhammika/adhammattā</i>, “illegitimate”. This word, too, is short of saying the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is invalid. Since these are the closest synonyms of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i>, it seems likely that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i> should be understood in a similar way.</p>
<p>Given the above, we must question whether the prevailing and contemporary understanding of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is correct. Is it really the case that the validity of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> depends purely on technical issues, thus making the word “reversible” ill-suited as a translation of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i>? Or could it be that our understanding of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is a product of evolution and that in the earliest stages there actually was such a thing as the reversing of the Sangha’s legal procedures?</p>
<p>The idea that a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> that has been improperly performed is inherently invalid is quite likely rooted in the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>akamma</i>, which is sometimes used in the canonical Vinaya to qualify an improperly performed <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Akamma</i> means “non-action”, implying that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> has not actually been performed at all. Although the word is found a number of times in the Vinaya, it is restricted to the highly technical expositions found in Kd 9 and in Kd 12.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-17' id='introduction-noteref-17' role='doc-noteref'>17</a> The more technical and impersonal the exposition, the more likely it is to be relatively late.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-18' id='introduction-noteref-18' role='doc-noteref'>18</a> Moreover, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṭṭhān’āraha</i> are only found twice in these chapters. Apart from this, it seems that it is only in the commentaries that this technical and absolute distinction between a valid and an invalid <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> is established once and for all.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to suppose, then, that the Vinaya Piṭaka may have gone through an evolution in how the validity of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> was understood. I am suggesting that in the earliest stages a legal procedure of the Sangha needed to be successfully challenged before it was considered invalid. The implication of this is that even if a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> has been improperly performed it stands as valid if no-one is aware of the problem or no-one brings attention to it.</p>
<p>This view is supported by a passage in Kd 2 that seems to say that perception is a factor in deciding whether the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> procedure has been performed correctly or not. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the observance day, four or more resident monks may have gathered together in a certain monastery. They don’t know there are other resident monks who haven’t arrived. Perceiving that they’re acting according to the Teaching and the Monastic Law, perceiving that the assembly is complete although it’s not, they do the observance-day ceremony and recite the Monastic Code. When they’ve just finished, and the entire gathering has left, a smaller number of resident monks arrive. In such a case, what has been recited is valid, and the late arrivals should announce their purity in the presence of the others. There’s no offense for the reciters. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#28.7.15">Kd 2:28.7.15</a>–28.7.21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the word “valid”—here <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sūddiṭṭhaṁ</i>, literally, “well-recited”—in the second last sentence. This passage is clear that an improperly performed <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>—in this case the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> procedure<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-19' id='introduction-noteref-19' role='doc-noteref'>19</a>—is valid so long as that is one’s perception. The fact that it was technically invalid, because not all the monks were present, is irrelevant.</p>
<p>This understanding of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i> has several benefits. One of these is that the obsession with purity of lineage, which is common in Theravada countries, is misplaced. It does not matter if an ordination procedure—taking one of the most obvious examples of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>—is wrongly performed. As long as the procedure is not challenged, it remains valid. According to this argument, the common practice among monastics of doubting the validity of one’s own or another’s ordination is misguided. Once again, we see evidence that the Buddha was more pragmatic than later generations of Buddhists.</p>
<p>So, despite my initial misgivings, I choose to translate <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kuppa</i> as “reversible” after all.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Koṭṭhaka</i>: “gatehouse”</h3>
<p>I. B. Horner renders <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i> as “store-room”, which is not specific enough.</p>
<p>In Kd 15, which among other things discusses allowable buildings and other structures, we find several allowances for encircling walls (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pākāra</i>), especially in cases where privacy was important, such as with saunas, places for bathing, or restrooms.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-20' id='introduction-noteref-20' role='doc-noteref'>20</a> In many of the cases where the Buddha gives an allowance for such a wall, he afterwards gives an allowance for a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i>, which in the context means an access point through the encircling wall. But since the word for “gateway” is <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dvāra</i>, it is not immediately obvious what <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i> refers to. Still, we find the compound <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dvārakoṭṭhaka</i>, “the gateway <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i>” in a number of places, which shows that although the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i> was not the gateway itself, it was closely associated with it.</p>
<p>In fact, we know from Kd 15 that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhakas</i> were rooms or houses, because it is said that grass and dust fell into them (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#14.4.15">Kd 15:14.4.15</a>). This would make no sense if it was merely an open area with a gate. Indeed, all instances where grass and dust fall into something, it refers to an enclosed space, usually a building of some kind. It is then said that it may be plastered inside and outside, again suggesting an enclosed space. We also know that this “gatehouse” would have often been small. For instance, we see all sorts of buildings, including saunas, having encircling walls and therefore also a gatehouse. But since the gatehouse is merely a subsidiary building to the main building, and the main building in this case is in itself quite humble, we can infer that the gatehouse would in all likelihood have been tiny.</p>
<p>What was the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i> used for? In the Suttas we find references to a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dovārika</i>, a “doorkeeper” or “gatekeeper”. They would inform the householders of any guest arriving at the gateway/gatehouse (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>bahidvārakoṭṭhaka</i>). It seems reasonable, then, to think the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i> was a room or house for the gatekeeper, where he either lived or stayed during his working hours. In many instances, however, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhaka</i> would have been no more than a storeroom, that is, a place to put aside shoes, sunshades, or other equipment one did not wish to bring into the main building. This might have been the function of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhakas</i> built in connection with saunas, for instance.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Khādanīya</i>: “fresh food”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya.</i></p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gaṇḍa</i>: “abscess”</h3>
<p>The basic meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> is “swelling”, but only occasionally does it appear in the Canonical texts with this meaning, as in the case of stuffing one’s cheeks while eating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a monk, out of disrespect, eats making a swelling on one or both sides, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk46/en/brahmali#1.5">Sk 46</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> is more specific than the generic term “swelling”. To start with, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> is one of the five common diseases found in ancient India:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that time a monk had the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> illness. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#14.4.13">Kd 6:14.4.13</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At that time in Magadha, there were five common diseases: leprosy, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i>, mild leprosy, tuberculosis, and epilepsy. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#39.1.1">Kd 1:39.1.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i>, you should not be ordained. Since a swelling is not always an illness—certainly not a serious one that would bar you from ordination—it must have a narrower meaning in the context of illness, which is what we are considering here.</p>
<p>One common rendering of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> is “boil”. A boil, however, is usually a superficial skin disease that often does not need much treatment, if any. A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i>, on the other hand, was often treated, even at the time of the Buddha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a nun … has a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> or a wound … ruptured, or split open, washed, anointed, bandaged, or unwrapped …” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc60/en/brahmali#1.16.1">Bi Pc 60:1.16.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> appears to be a skin disease that requires a significant amount of attention. “A boil” does not seem quite right, whereas “an abscess” or perhaps “a cyst” seems appropriate.</p>
<p>Another passage that sheds light on the meaning on this word is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Monks, suppose there was a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> that was many years old. And that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> had nine continually open wounds. Whatever oozed out of them would be filthy, stinking, and disgusting.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an9.15/en/sujato#1.1">AN 9.15</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage suggests that “ulcer” may be the appropriate rendering.</p>
<p>It may be that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> does not have an exact equivalent in modern medical terminology. It seems, in fact, that it covers a number of related skin diseases, especially abscesses and ulcers. Given that the clearest description of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gaṇḍa</i> in the Vinaya concerns its rupturing and splitting open, I have settled on “abscess” as the closest equivalent.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gāma</i>: “inhabited area”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gāma</i> is usually rendered as “village”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka, however, this is often too narrow. For instance, we often find <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gāma</i> used in contrast to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>arañña</i>, “wilderness”. In these cases, it clearly means any kind of inhabited area, not just the more restrictive sense of “village”. Moreover, according to the word commentary,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-21' id='introduction-noteref-21' role='doc-noteref'>21</a> even a single house or a caravan stationary for an extended period can be regarded as a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gāma</i>. Again, “inhabited area” is a better fit than “village”. Unless the context or the narrative flow requires otherwise, I have given preference to the more general and technical meaning of “inhabited area”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gihigata</i>: “married girl”</h3>
<p>Occasionally <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gihigata</i> is a generic term for “householder” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali#1.9.22">Kd 21:1.9.22</a>). Normally, however, it refers to a female, presumably a female householder. The definition from the Vinaya Piṭaka is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A woman who has gone to the place of a man is called a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gihigata</i>. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc65/en/brahmali#2.1.7">Bi Pc 65:2.1.7</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentaries elaborate as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gihigata</i>: who has gone to the place of a man; the meaning is “one who has attained cohabitation with a man”.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-22' id='introduction-noteref-22' role='doc-noteref'>22</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gihigatāya</i>: here a woman who has gone to the place of a man is called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gihigata</i>. She is called a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gihigata</i> because, on account of sex, she has gone to a householder considered a man or he has gone to her.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-23' id='introduction-noteref-23' role='doc-noteref'>23</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although the above would clearly include marriage, it is impossible to know whether it is restricted to this. Less formal kinds of relationship might also be implied. Given the conservative nature of ancient Indian society, however, it seems reasonable to think that it refers, in the main, to marriage.</p>
<p>The evidence from the Vinayas of other schools also suggest that a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gihigata</i> is a married girl. I have received the following information from Ven. Vimalañāṇī (private communication):</p>
<ul>

<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Guhā</i>: “cave”</h3>
<p>The term <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guhā</i> does not have a precise equivalent in English. The general meaning seems to be “enclosed place” or “hiding place”, derived from the root <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guh</i>, meaning “to cover” or “to hide”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka such places are either naturally occurring, as in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>giriguhā</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd16/en/brahmali#1.1.4">Kd 16:1.1.4</a>), or man-made (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#5.6.4">Kd 3:5.6.4</a>). In all cases a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guhā</i> was used to shelter or cover something, for instance, to shelter food from rain (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#33.2.1">Kd 6:33.2.1</a>), to store robes away from destruction by insects (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#7.1.3">Kd 8:7.1.3</a>), and to shelter monastics while they do the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i> procedure (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#8.1.7">Kd 2:8.1.7</a>).</p>
<p>The commentaries add the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Guhā</i>: a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guhā</i> made of bricks, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guhā</i> made of rocks, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guhā</i> made of wood, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guhā</i> made of dirt.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-24' id='introduction-noteref-24' role='doc-noteref'>24</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Giriguha</i>: in the middle of two hills or a great opening like a tunnel in just one (of them).<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-25' id='introduction-noteref-25' role='doc-noteref'>25</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In sum, it is likely that “cave” does not properly capture all the nuances of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>guhā</i>, but in the absence of a more fitting term, it is perhaps satisfactory.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Cīvara</i>: “robe”, “robe-cloth”</h3>
<p>This word has two fairly distinct meanings: “a (finished) robe” and “robe-cloth”. Often the context makes it clear which one is meant, but sometimes it does not. We need a rule to decide how to translate in ambiguous cases.</p>
<p>I will argue here that the meaning “robe” is primary, whereas “robe-cloth” is secondary. This follows from several different lines of reasoning. First, the meaning “robe” is by far the most common one. The word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> is found approximately 630 times in the main four Nikāyas. A simple search and perusal of the material is enough to make it clear that the vast majority of these refer to “robe”. There are a few indeterminate uses of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>, but as far as I am aware none that unambiguously means “robe-cloth”. Second, and connected to the previous reason, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> is the normal word for a “(monastic) robe” in Pali literature. For a monastic, the concept of a “robe” is far more significant than the idea of “robe-cloth”. Because of the importance of the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> in the meaning of “robe” and its frequent usage in this meaning, it is natural to read it as “robe”, unless “robe-cloth” is specifically required by the context. Third, “robe-cloth” is a derived meaning that only makes sense in the context of robes, whereas the reverse is not true. It follows that the meaning “robe” is more fundamental and therefore more likely to be intended in ambiguous cases. Fourth, in the Sutta-vibhaṅga we often find <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> used as “robe” in the origin stories. It is then natural to read <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> as “robe” also in the rule. Only in the word analysis is <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> then interpreted as “robe-cloth”. This pattern is found in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np1/en/brahmali#3.1.9">Bu NP 1</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np5/en/brahmali#3.1.9">5</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np6/en/brahmali#3.1.11">6</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np25/en/brahmali#2.9">25</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np27/en/brahmali#2.11">27</a>, and in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc59/en/brahmali#2.1.17">Bu Pc 59</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc60/en/brahmali#2.1.9">60</a>. This suggests that “robe-cloth” in many cases is a secondary derivation that emerged as the evolving Vinaya strove for clear definitions.</p>
<p>Based on the above considerations, my default translation of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> is “robe”. I render it as “robe-cloth” only when required by the context, of which there are three in particular.</p>
<p>The first is where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> is specifically interpreted as any cloth that is larger than the smallest cloth that can be assigned to another (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappita</i>), meaning larger than 8 by 4 standard fingerbreadths. In these cases, while not excluding the meaning “robe”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> clearly includes “robe-cloth”. In any rule where this definition is found, I render all subsequent occurrences of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> in that rule as “robe-cloth”.</p>
<p>The second context is the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathina</i> ceremony and the robe season, which are closely linked. This was a time when the Sangha collected cloth for distribution to its members. In a number of instances, it is stated that a monk did not have enough cloth for a robe and was awaiting further gifts. The implication is that the cloth he had was robe-cloth, not a complete robe. So, in the context of the robe season, I always render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> as “robe-cloth”.</p>
<p>The third context is where lay people give <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> to the monastics. Going by the description in the Chapter on Robes, lay people would normally (but not always, it seems) give cloth that the monastics would then make into finished robes (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#9.2.4">Kd 8:9.2.4</a>). So, unless the context requires otherwise, whenever a lay person is giving <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> to monastics, including the time it is stored in a monastery, I render it as “robe-cloth”.</p>
<p>Finally, the texts also distinguish between the singular <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bahuṁ cīvaraṁ</i> and the plural (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>bahūni</i>) <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvarāni</i>, where the former most naturally refers to “much robe-cloth”, whereas the latter usually refers to “many robes”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Cuṇṇa</i>: “bath powder”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mattika</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Codeti</i>: “to accuse”, “to prompt”, “to confront”</h3>
<p>The semantic range of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>codeti</i> is similar to that of “to admonish”. In particular, it covers both the meaning of “to urge” and “to reprimand”. In <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10/en/brahmali#1.3.13">Bu NP 10</a> <i translate='no' lang='pli'>codeti</i> means to urge or prompt someone to offer a robe, that is, a robe that has already been promised. In one passage in the Great Chapter, the lay people <i translate='no' lang='pli'>codeti</i> the monks, here meaning “to confront” them or “to reprimand” them (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#24.5.5">Kd 1:24.5.5</a>). In both of these instances “admonish” would work well. In most other contexts <i translate='no' lang='pli'>codeti</i> means “to confront” or “to accuse” someone of a wrongdoing. In these cases, too, “admonish” would fit. However, since “admonish” is perhaps a slightly old-fashioned and increasingly uncommon word, I have instead rendered <i translate='no' lang='pli'>codeti</i> according to context, using “to prompt” at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10),%20%E2%80%9Cto%20confront%E2%80%9D%20at%20[Kd%C2%A01/en/brahmali#24.5.5](pli-tv-kd1:24.5.5">Bu NP 10</a>, and “to accuse” elsewhere.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Chakaṇa</i>: “detergent”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mattika</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Jantāghara</i>: “sauna”</h3>
<p>The Buddha’s personal physician, Jīvaka, recommended a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>janṭāghara</i> for the Sangha to keep the monastics healthy (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#14.1.8">Kd 15:14.1.8</a>). The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jantāghara</i> was a room with a fireplace and a flue (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#14.3.16">Kd 15:14.3.16</a>). It was used to make one sweat (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#14.3.31">Kd 15:14.3.31</a>) and was also a place for cleaning oneself (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#25.12.4">Kd 1:25.12.4</a>). Moreover, the verb for what one does in a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jantāghara</i> is “bathe”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nahāyati</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#27.4.15">Kd 20:27.4.15</a>). All in all it comes close to what we now call a sauna.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Jātarūparajata</i>: “gold, silver, and money”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Jātarūparajata</i> literally means “gold and silver”. Yet, as can be seen from other passages, this includes gold and silver coins, that is, money. For instance, at <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu nissaggiya pācittiya</i> 18 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>rajata</i> is defined as money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silver: a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kahāpaṇa</i> coin, a copper <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māsaka</i> coin, a wooden <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māsaka</i> coin, a resin <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māsaka</i> coin—whatever is used in commerce. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np18/en/brahmali#2.7">Bu NP 18:2.7</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, the context in Kd 22 makes it clear that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jātarūparajata</i> refers to money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t give a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kahāpaṇa</i> to the Sangha, or half a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kahāpaṇa</i>, or a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāda</i>, or a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māsaka</i>. Gold, silver, and money aren’t allowable for the Sakyan monastics.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali#1.1.9">Kd 22:1.19</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also separate entry for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i>, where I make the case that this word means “gold coins”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dūseti</i>/<i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūsaka</i>: “to rape”/“rapist”</h3>
<p>The basic meaning of this word—the two words in the heading being respectively the verbal form and the noun form of the same root—is “to spoil” something or someone. One way “to spoil” a person is through sex, especially forced sex. This is what one of the sub-commentaries has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He is called a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūsaka</i> of a nun: having had sexual intercourse with an ordinary <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>, because of “spoiling” her, he has “spoiled” a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-26' id='introduction-noteref-26' role='doc-noteref'>26</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming that the nun did not consent, the meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> must be “to rape”. This meaning is even more explicit in several Canonical passages, for instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A monk rapes a sleeping monk: if he wakes up and consents, both should be expelled. If he wakes up but does not consent, then the “spoiler” should be expelled. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.7.11">Bu Pj 1:9.7.11</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the action results in expulsion, it must refer to sexual intercourse, in which case the lack of consent means that “rapist” is the appropriate translation of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūsaka</i>. The same is true for the story of the rape of the nun Uppalavaṇṇā, told in the same rule. Here, too, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> must refer to rape, since she is “grabbed hold of” and the potential offense for the nun is a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>. Also, in the origin story to Bu Ss 8, where Dabba the Mallian is accused of having <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūsita</i> a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>, the most likely meaning is “rape” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8/en/brahmali#1.8.19">Bu Ss 8:1.8.19</a>). The context makes it clear that it refers to sexual intercourse, and the nature of the accusation suggests rape. There are also a number of cases where various kinds of people are said to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> women who are alone (see <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc27/en/brahmali#2.8">Bu Pc 27:2.8</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28/en/brahmali#2.9">Bu Pc 28:2.9</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4/en/brahmali#1.8">Bu Pd 4:1.8</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali#2.7">Bi Ss 3:2.7</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali#4.3">Bi Ss 3:4.3</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc37/en/brahmali#1.3">Bi Pc 37:1.3</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc38/en/brahmali#1.3">38:1.3</a>, and two instances in the Khandhakas at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#23.1.1">Kd 20:23.1.1</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#27.4.23">Kd 20:27.4.23</a>). The most obvious meaning of the word in these cases is “rape”. From these examples it seems the dominant meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> in the Canonical Vinaya is “rape”.</p>
<p>Still, there are several contexts where the word “rape” is too strong. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali#1.14">Bi Pj 5:1.14</a> a layman is said to desire to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>. Eventually, when they find themselves in a private place, they touch each other lustfully. A similar situation is found in the origin story at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/brahmali#1.1.29">Bu Ss 2:1.1.29</a>. In the former case “to be intimate with” seems an appropriate rendering, whereas in the latter “to molest” is more to the point. In Kd 1 we find a few cases where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> seems to refer to consensual sex, such as the case of two novices who <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> each other (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#52.1.3">Kd 1:52.1.3</a>).</p>
<p>In still other contexts the meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i> is not related to sexuality. In these cases, the usual meaning is “to spoil”. For instance, in one case the faith of the laypeople is said to be <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i>, “spoiled” or “corrupted” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13/en/brahmali#2.8">Bu Ss 13:2.8</a>). In other contexts, fields are said to be <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i>, “spoiled”, when someone stands in them or someone discards waste there (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc19/en/brahmali#1.5">Bu Pc 19:1.5</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc9/en/brahmali#1.5">Bi Pc 9:1.5</a>). In the Khandhakas the word of the Buddha is said to be <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dūseti</i>, “spoiled” or “corrupted”, by those who teach the Dhamma using their own expressions (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#33.1.5">Kd 15:33.1.5</a>).</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhanu</i>: “bow-length”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhammavinaya</i>: “spiritual path”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhammavinaya</i> is the compounded form of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhamma</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i>. In this context <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhamma</i> must mean “teaching”, whether that of the Buddha or some other teaching, whereas <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> seems to mean “training”, see the separate entry for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i>. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhammavinaya</i> is often used to refer to the Buddha’s system of teaching and training, thus referring to his religion or spiritual path. It is close in meaning to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sāsana</i> (“(spiritual) instruction” or “Buddhism”) and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>brahmacariya</i> (“spiritual life”). It is interesting, however, that in the Chapter on Nuns we find <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhammavinaya</i> apparently used to refer to all religions or spiritual paths that existed in ancient India (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#1.6.8">Kd 20:1.6.8</a>). The same is true of the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, where the Buddha explains to the wanderer Subhadda that awakening can be achieved in whatever <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhammavinaya</i> there is the noble eightfold path (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.27.2">DN 16:5.27.2</a>). And so, in the broadest sense <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhammavinaya</i> is a reference to any “spiritual path”, and I render it as such.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nānāsaṁvāsa/nānāsaṁvāsako: “</i>who belongs to a different community” "one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nānāsaṁvāsaka</i> (and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>samānasaṁvāsaka</i>) need to be carefully distinguished from <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nānāsaṁvāsa</i> (and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>samānasaṁvāsa</i>). Only the former means “one belonging to a different Buddhist sect”. The latter means “belonging to a different community”, as decided by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmās</i>, “monastic zones”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nāseti</i>: “to expel”</h3>
<p>I render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> as “offense entailing expulsion” and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nāseti</i> as “expulsion”. I use the same rendering for the two words because they are closely related in the Vinaya Piṭaka. At Bu Pj 1, we find the following use of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nāseti</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A monk rapes a sleeping monk: if he wakes up and consents, both should be expelled. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.7.11">Bu Pj 1:9.7.11</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both monks have committed a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense, and the consequence is that they are <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nāseti</i>, which here, then, must mean “expelled”. Since there is no verbal form of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>, it seems <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nāseti</i> takes on that function. Moreover, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nāseti</i> is a less technical term than <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i>, which only applies to fully ordained monastics. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nāseti</i>, on the other hand, is used more broadly, including for novices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A novice rapes a sleeping novice: if he wakes up and consents, both should be expelled. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.7.20">Bu Pj 1:9.7.20</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Niyassa</i>: “demotion”</h3>
<p>The literal meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>niyassa</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ni + yasa</i>, is something like “disrepute”. The only use of this word in the Vinaya, however, is in connection with the eponymous legal procedure, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>niyassakamma</i>. The main characteristic that distinguishes this procedure from other <i translate='no' lang='pli'>daṇḍakammas</i>, “punishment procedures”, is that the person against whom it is done must live with formal support, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaya</i>. In effect they are treated like a junior monastic. For this reason “demotion” seems like an appropriate rendering.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nisīdana</i>: “sitting mat”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nisīdana</i> is usually rendered as “sitting cloth”. This translation seems to be a result of the current practice of using the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdana</i> wherever one sits down, especially in public. For most monastics, this means it is used almost exclusively indoors, where a sitting cloth is not really required. In effect, it ends up having more of a ceremonial value than any real purpose. The evidence from the Suttas, however, shows that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdana</i> was used outdoors as an underlay when sitting on the ground, presumably to protect the robes.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-27' id='introduction-noteref-27' role='doc-noteref'>27</a> <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np15/en/brahmali#1.3.10.1">Bu NP 15</a>, which concerns the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdanasanthata</i>, the “sitting blanket”, points to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdanas</i> being made of extra thick material, which again fits with outdoor usage. For this reason, I have opted to render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisīdana</i> as “sitting mat”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nissaya/nissāya</i>: “formal support”, “support”</h3>
<p>“Formal support” renders <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaya</i>, often translated as “dependence”. Yet “dependence” only gives one nuance of this word. Just as common in the Canonical texts, perhaps more common, is the idea of “support”. “Support” gives a different psychological perspective on <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaya</i>, one that is perhaps more positive. Here are a couple of instances where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaya</i> is closer in meaning to “support” than “dependence”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Sudinna was eating the previous evening’s porridge, supported by the base of a certain wall … (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#5.6.9">Bu Pj 1:5.6.9</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“But since we’re staying here, we look to you for support.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np30/en/brahmali#1.10">Bu NP 30:1.10</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Nissaya</i> as a technical term of the Vinaya Piṭaka does not just mean any kind of support. Rather, it refers to the institutionalized relationship between teacher and student. This is a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>formal</i> relationship, and thus my rendering.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Paṇḍaka</i>: “<i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>”</h3>
<p>I have left the term <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> untranslated. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Paṇḍaka</i> is not interpreted in the Canonical literature, and there are few contextual hints as to its meaning. One of the few Canonical passages that deals with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> in any detail is found in Kd 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At one time a certain <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> had gone forth as a monk. He went to the young monks and said, “Come, Venerables, have sex with me.”</p>
<p>The monks dismissed him, “Go away, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>. We don’t want you.”</p>
<p>He went to the big and fat novices, said the same thing, and got the same response. He then went to the elephant keepers and the horse keepers, and once again said the same thing. And they had sex with him.</p>
<p>They complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan monastics are <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍakas</i>. And those who are not have sex with them. None of them is celibate.”</p>
<p>The monks heard their complaints and told the Buddha.</p>
<p>“A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> shouldn’t be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#61.1.1">Kd 1:61.1.1</a>–61.1.19)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The description here suggests that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍakas</i> had an especially high libido. From other passages it is clear that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> was considered a kind of third sex, neither male nor female. At Bu Pj 1 we find a list of four kinds of humans: women, hermaphrodites (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>ubhatobyañjanakas</i>, see separate entry), <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍakas</i>, and men (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.1.1">Bu Pj 1:9.1.1</a>–9.1.8). In other words, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> was considered neither male nor female. A similar distinction is found at Bu Ss 2 and 4, where one perceives a person as either a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>, an animal, a man, or a woman (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/brahmali#3.1.21">Bu Ss 2:3.1.21</a>–3.1.27 and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4/en/brahmali#3.1.11">Bu Ss 4:3.1.11</a>–3.1.13). Further, it seems that the designation <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> as a term for a kind of libidinous third-sex individual fits with how it was used in the broader Indian culture, especially as a development from the earlier and probably more general term <i translate='no' lang='pli'>napuṁsaka</i>, literally, “not a man”. See Bhikkhu*nī Vimala’s essay, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Yellow Gate</i>, on the historical and semantic development of these terms.</p>
<p>For further information on the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> as it relates to the Vinaya, we need to consult the Pali commentaries, which interpret the term as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>: a sexless person (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>napuṁsaka</i>) with strong defilements, one whose (sexual) fevers are not allayed. Overcome by the force of his fevers, he desires friendship with anyone.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-28' id='introduction-noteref-28' role='doc-noteref'>28</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>, monks”: here there are five kinds of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>: the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āsittapaṇḍaka,</i> the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>usūyapaṇḍaka,</i> the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>opakkamikapaṇḍaka,</i> the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pakkhapaṇḍaka,</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>napuṁsakapaṇḍaka</i>. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āsittapaṇḍaka</i> allays his sexual fevers by taking the penis of another in his mouth and being sprinkled by semen. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>usūyapaṇḍaka</i> allays his sexual fevers by jealously watching others having sex. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>opakkamikapaṇḍaka</i> has had his testicles removed. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pakkhapaṇḍaka</i> is a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> who, as a result of bad <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i>, is a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> during the fortnight when the moon is waning, but whose sexual fevers are calmed during the fortnight when the moon is waxing. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>napuṁsakapaṇḍaka</i> is one who is undeveloped from the time of conception. Of these, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āsittapaṇḍaka</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>usūyapaṇḍaka</i> are not barred from the going forth, but the other three are. It is said in the Kurundi that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pakkhapaṇḍaka</i> is barred from the going forth during the fortnight he is a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>. That: “A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> should not be given the full ordination. If it has been given, he should be expelled” was said [in the Canonical text] with reference to those for whom the going forth is barred. And he should be expelled because of his sexual characteristics.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-29' id='introduction-noteref-29' role='doc-noteref'>29</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems from the above that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍakas</i> constitute a varied group, all of whom are regarded as a kind of third sex.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-30' id='introduction-noteref-30' role='doc-noteref'>30</a> What they have in common is either a strong libido or perhaps sexual urges that cannot be properly satisfied. It is impossible to come up with an English umbrella term that satisfactorily captures all these individuals. The matter is further complicated by the commentarial explanation that some <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍakas</i> are allowed to go forth whereas others are not. All things considered, I have decided to leave <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> untranslated.</p>
<p>Since the idea of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> is so tightly tied up with ancient Indian social and cultural categories, and there appear to be no comparable categories in modern society, at least in the West, it would seem that the rule prohibiting <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍakas</i> from ordaining is largely meaningless in a modern context.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Parikkhāra</i>: “requisite(s)”, “ingredient(s)”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Parikkhāra</i>, “requisite” or “ingredient”, is used in both the plural and the singular. Often, however, even the singular form is plural in meaning, similar to how the word “equipment” is used in English. Here are a couple unambiguous instances:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They prepared a number of monastic requisites (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>parikkhāraṁ</i>, singular): a bowl, a robe, a sitting mat, a needle case, a belt, a water filter, and a water strainer. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali#2.1.9">Kd 22:2.1.9</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On one occasion a nun who was dying said, “When I’m dead, give my requisites (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>parikkhāro</i>, singular) to the Sangha.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#11.1.1">Kd 20:11.1.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given this precedent, I render the grammatical singular <i translate='no' lang='pli'>parikkhāra</i> as the plural “requisites” in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī nissaggiya pācittiyas</i> 6, 7, and 10, and as the plural “ingredients” in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī nissaggiya pācittiyas</i> 8 and 9. In the context, the plural seems more appropriate.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Paripucchā</i>: “questioning”, “testing”</h3>
<p>The basic meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paripucchā</i> is “to question” or “to ask”, as used for instance at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc71/en/brahmali#1.19.1">Bu Pc 71:1.19.1</a>. Often, however, it refers to a teacher questioning his student, in the sense of finding out how much the student knows. In such cases I render the word as “testing”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pariveṇa</i>: “yard”</h3>
<p>I. B. Horner renders <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pariveṇa</i> as “cell”, for which there is no proper basis. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pariveṇa</i> is the area surrounding a building. That it is not an indoor area can be seen from <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#14.5.1">Kd 15:14.5.1</a> where a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pariveṇa</i> is said to get muddy, upon which the Buddha allows gravel, stepping stones, and drains. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pariveṇa</i> is often mentioned in connection with keeping a building tidy, specifically as an area that is to be swept, e.g. at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/brahmali#1.1.6">Bu Ss 2:1.1.6</a>. It seems natural to conclude that this must refer to the area, or part of it, that surrounds a building. This is confirmed by the commentaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pariveṇa</i>: 11 meters surrounding each individual dwelling.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-31' id='introduction-noteref-31' role='doc-noteref'>31</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, but not always it seems, this area was walled in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pariveṇa</i>: a place separately delimited by a wall within a large monastery.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-32' id='introduction-noteref-32' role='doc-noteref'>32</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The existence of surrounding walls fits with the fact that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pariveṇas</i> are said to be constructed (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#5.6.5">Kd 3:5.6.5</a>). So does the frequent mention in the Vinaya Piṭaka of entry points, known as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhakas</i>, “gatehouses”, through the surrounding walls. See the separate entry on <i translate='no' lang='pli'>koṭṭhakas</i>.</p>
<p>On a more general note, the term <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pariveṇa</i> is not found in the four main Nikāyas, and in the Vinaya it is found only in narratives, minor rules on conduct, and explanatory material. This suggests it may not have existed in the earliest period of Buddhist monasticism. The earliest buildings and monasteries would have been simple, without such embellishments, especially the surrounding walls.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pavāraṇā/pavāreti</i>: “invitation ceremony”/“to invite (to eat more)”</h3>
<p>The cognate words <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāreti</i> have the general sense of “offer” or “invitation”, with the exact meaning depending on the context. Because these contexts are mostly distinct and because I try to stay as close to English idiom as I can, I render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>/<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāreti</i> slightly differently in each case.</p>
<p>The most important context for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>/<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāreti</i> is the ceremony named after it. This is explained in detail in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd4/en/brahmali">Kd 4</a>. This <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i> begins with a story of monks who spent the rainy season in complete silence. The Buddha does not approve and lays down a rule that this should not be done. He then establishes the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>, during which each monastic is to say the following in the presence of the Sangha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> the Sangha concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, venerables, out of compassion. If I see (a fault), I will make amends.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd4/en/brahmali#1.14.7">Kd 4:1.14.7</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is clear that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> is an invitation to one’s fellow monastics to admonish or point out wrong behavior. In other words, it is a specific kind of invitation to correct. It follows that rendering <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>, in this context, simply as “invitation” is misleading. To bring out this narrow meaning I use “invitation to correct”.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above quote, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> is a formal invitation that is part of a set ritual performed by the Sangha in any given monastery. Historically this has been regarded as a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, “a legal procedure”, but its status in the Canonical Vinaya is actually ambiguous. Although the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> is occasionally called the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇākamma</i>, “the invitation (legal) procedure”, this usage is rare in the Canonical texts. Apart from a few instances in the Parivāra, in the entire Vinaya Piṭaka this usage is only found in one short subchapter at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd4/en/brahmali#3.2.2">Kd 4:3.2.2</a>–3.2.17. In fact, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> is sometimes mentioned as an alternative to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghakamma</i>, giving the impression that it was not originally considered a legal procedure at all, or at least that it was considered special enough to be singled out. (The same is true for the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uposatha</i>, “the observance day”.) Here is an example from Bu Ss 8:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is no (doing of) observance days, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>, or legal procedures with you.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss8/en/brahmali#3.1.4">Bu Ss 8:3.1.4</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And another from the Chapter on Schism in the Sangha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If, based on any of these eighteen grounds, they pull away and separate, and they do the observance-day ceremony, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>, or legal procedures of the Sangha separately, then there is a schism in the Sangha.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#5.2.21">Kd 17:5.2.21</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests that it is only appropriate to use the expression “invitation procedure” when <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> is compounded with the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kamma</i> as in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇākamma</i>. Given these considerations, whenever <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i> refers to the overall ritual as performed by the Sangha, without being specifically called an “invitation procedure”, I render it as “invitation ceremony”.</p>
<p>Although the invitation ceremony is the most significant context for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāraṇā</i>/<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāreti</i>, they are also used for other purposes. One important instance is where the verb <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavāreti</i> is used in conjunction with a meal invitation. At such invitations, the lay host would normally keep on serving the monastics until the monastics were satisfied and declined any further offer of food. The monastic is then said to be <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavārita</i>, “invited”—that is, they have been invited to eat more but have refused—the implication being that they have had enough. In such contexts English idiom requires “offered” rather than “invited”, and so I render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavārita</i> as “refused an offer to eat more”. This meaning is especially relevant at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali#3.1.7">Bu Pc 35</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36/en/brahmali#2.1.9">36</a>, as well as <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali#2.1.7">Bi Pc 54</a>.</p>
<p>Another significant context is where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pavārita</i> refers to a lay person who has given a monastic an invitation to ask for requisites or to specify anything regarding a requisite, for instance at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np6/en/brahmali#3.4.4">Bu NP 6</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np11/en/brahmali#2.3.5">Bi NP 11</a>. In these cases, the word is rendered as “those who have given an invitation”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pāsāda</i>: “stilt house”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pāsāda</i> is often rendered as “palace” or “mansion”. This seems to be based entirely on commentarial explanations. The Canonical texts do not lend any support to either of these two renderings.</p>
<p>Let us take a brief look at a couple of commentarial descriptions. In the Aṅguttara Nikāya the Buddha-to-be is said to have had three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> before he left the household life, one for each of the Indian seasons (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.39/en/sujato#2.1">AN 3.39:2.1</a>). According to the commentary, these were respectively nine, seven, and five stories tall.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-33' id='introduction-noteref-33' role='doc-noteref'>33</a> Similarly, the commentary to the Majjhima Nikāya speaks of a seven story <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-34' id='introduction-noteref-34' role='doc-noteref'>34</a></p>
<p>These commentarial descriptions are hard to take seriously. There are no obvious mentions in the four Nikāyas or the Vinaya Piṭaka of multi-story buildings, except for occasional references to a single upper story or a loft, such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uparivehāsakuṭi</i> of <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc18/en/brahmali#1.18.1">Bu Pc 18</a>. Moreover, the archaeological evidence from the period suggests that the towns were modest in size, even the big ones like Sāvatthī. Academic estimates for the size of the largest cities are typically under 10,000 inhabitants.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-35' id='introduction-noteref-35' role='doc-noteref'>35</a> It seems unlikely that these would have had enough material resources and wealth to build very large or tall structures. Even more important is the fact that all buildings were built of perishable materials, which is why there are no material remains from the earliest period of Buddhism, except for occasional embankments and city walls. Once again, it seems unlikely they would have built very large buildings, especially very tall ones, out of wood. Everything in the archaeological record from the Ganges plain for the relevant period points to small-scale buildings.</p>
<p>So, if the commentarial notions are fanciful, what were these <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i>? A suitable point of departure is to note that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> were allowed by the Buddha for monastics. Now one of the main principles of the Vinaya is that monastics should not live in luxury. On this basis alone we can conclude that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> were not generally luxurious. This immediately eliminates “palace” and “mansion” as suitable translations.</p>
<p>Another thing that stands out about <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> is that they are always ascended to and descended from. This means that they must have been relatively tall buildings. An interesting point is that the Suttas do not seem to mention any other way of accessing these buildings—apart from ascent/descent—which must mean that they were not directly accessible from ground level. They must have been built on some sort of high foundation. A passage in the Kosala Saṁyutta is particularly instructive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Suppose, great king, a man would climb from the ground on to a palanquin, or from a palanquin on to horseback, or from horseback to an elephant mount, or from an elephant mount to a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> …” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn3.21/en/sujato#5.1">SN 3.21:5.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to a number of passages, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> had external staircases (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>sopāṇakaḷevara</i> at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn85/en/sujato#5.1">MN 85:5.1</a>) or ladders (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>nisseṇi</i> at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn9/en/sujato#37.1">DN 9:37.1</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn13/en/sujato#21.1">DN 13:21.1</a>), including the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> given to the Sangha by Visākha (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn107/en/sujato#2.2">MN 107:2.2</a>), and they seem always to have been entered with the help of these. The similes in DN 9 and DN 13 speak of making the ladder before building a hypothetical <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>. These similes seem to imply that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>all pāsādas</i> were accessed by climbing. In addition, the use of the word “ladder” shows that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> were often quite humble buildings.</p>
<p>The need for climbing to get access also seems to be why—in one of the case studies at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.47.3">Bu Pj 2:7.47.3</a>—Ven. Pilindavaccha was able to make use of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> to hide children from kidnappers. If <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> were high off the ground and the access ladder was removed, then the children were presumably safe. We also find the common compound <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uparipāsāda</i>, “up the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>”, which fits this description. No other names for types of buildings are compounded with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upari</i> in this way.</p>
<p>The final clue to the meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> is that they seem to have had a space underneath. In the passage from AN 3.39 mentioned above, where the Buddha speaks of his life before going forth, it is said that he stayed in the rainy-season <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> for the full four months of the rainy season, without <i translate='no' lang='pli'>heṭṭhāpāsādaṁ orohāmi</i>. The verb <i translate='no' lang='pli'>orohati</i> means “to descend” and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>heṭṭhā</i> means “below”. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Heṭṭhā</i> is used in other compounds such as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>heṭṭhāmañcaṁ</i> which unambiguously means “below the bed (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>mañca</i>)”. It follows that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>heṭṭhāpāsādaṁ orohāmi</i> can only really mean “I descended to below the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>”, which must mean that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> had open spaces underneath them. The most obvious sort of building that fits with this is a stilt house.</p>
<p>Now a stilt house would normally be a fairly humble building compared to a palace. But it seems likely to me that in an ancient Indian setting they would have had considerable advantages, and thus were probably regarded as high-end housing. In a climate where heavy rain and flooding were common, stilt houses would be particularly sought after. It is also possible, as the story with Pilindavaccha shows, that these houses were considered relatively safe from burglars and the like.</p>
<p>There are a couple of passages in the Suttas, however, where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> clearly does refer to a “palace”, such as Sakka’s and Mahāsudassana’s palaces (respectively at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato#8.9">MN 37:8.9</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17/en/sujato#1.25.8">DN 17:1.25.8</a>). In both these cases the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsādas</i> were very grand structures, and even the word “palace” may not do full justice to their magnificence. Yet in both instances the setting is mythological; they do not refer to historical India. Perhaps the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> was used because the palaces were envisaged as grander versions of the best buildings they had at the time.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pūva</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mantha</i>: “cookie” and “cracker”</h3>
<p>I. B. Horner renders <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pūva</i> as “cake”. Yet according to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34/en/brahmali#2.1.6">Bu Pc 34</a>, they were used as gifts to be sent away, which presumably meant they were dry edibles. The commentary has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever is for the purpose of sending away: whatever cake having a superior taste, etc., is prepared as a gift, all that is here counted as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pūva.</i><a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-36' id='introduction-noteref-36' role='doc-noteref'>36</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same rule says that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pūvas</i> where cooked, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paci</i>. According to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41/en/brahmali#1.1.4">Bu Pc 41</a>, on several occasions Ānanda accidently gave two <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pūvas</i> to a female wanderer when intending to give only one. All this fits with the idea of a cookie, but is more difficult to reconcile with “cake”. Finally, according to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51/en/brahmali#2.1.2">Bu Pc 51</a>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pūvas</i> where used to make alcohol, which presumably means they contained starch and/or sugar. Although a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pūva</i> is unlikely to be an exact equivalent of what we now call a “cookie”, it would not seem to be far off the mark.</p>
<p>I. B. Horner then translates <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mantha</i> as “barley gruel”, which seems even further off the mark. According to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc34/en/brahmali#2.1.8">Bu Pc 34</a>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>manthas</i> were used as provisions for journeys, which yet again must mean they were dry edibles. Here is the commentarial gloss:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever provisions for a journey: whatever flour made from sesame, grains, etc., whether made into goods or not, and that is prepared for the journey of those traveling, all that is here counted as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mantha</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-37' id='introduction-noteref-37' role='doc-noteref'>37</a></p>

<p>Moreover, since they were used as provisions rather than as gifts, it seems reasonable to assume they were not sweet.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pokkharaṇī</i>: “(lotus) pond” or “(lotus) tank”</h3>
<p>The usual meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pokkharaṇī</i> as “lotus pond” is well established in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suttas</i>. Much of the time they seem to have been decorative, but there are few instances in the Vinaya where they are used for washing, such as in Mahā-khandhaka where the Buddha washes a cloth in a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pokkharaṇī</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#20.1.4">Kd 1:20.1.4</a>). In fact, this distinction in use is reflected in the commentaries, which speak of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nahāna-pokkharaṇī</i>, “<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pokkharaṇī</i> for bathing”, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kīḷana-pokkharaṇī</i>, “<i translate='no' lang='pli'>pokkharaṇī</i> for playing”. Because <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pokkharaṇīs</i> were given to monasteries “for the benefit of the Sangha” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#17.2.1">Kd 15:17.2.1</a>), they were probably meant for bathing and washing, not just for decoration. Moreover, it seems the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pokkharaṇīs</i> could be quite elaborate structures with foundations, staircases, and rails (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#17.2.6">Kd 15:17.2.6</a>). For these reasons, I vary my translation according to context, sometimes using “pond”, at other times “tank”, and sometimes adding the qualifier “lotus”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Phāṇita: “</i>syrup”</h3>
<p>I. B. Horner translates <i translate='no' lang='pli'>phāṇita</i> as “molasses”, which doesn’t quite hit the mark. SED defines <i translate='no' lang='pli'>phāṇita</i> as “the inspissated juice of the sugar cane or other plants”, in other words, “cane syrup”. According to the commentary at Sp 1.623 it can be either cooked or uncooked, the difference presumably being whether it is raw or concentrated. “Syrup” seems closer to the mark than “molasses”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhattagga</i>: “dining hall”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhattagga</i> is literally “a meal house”. The name suggests that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhattagga</i> was a separate building for eating. They were found both in private houses and in monasteries (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd10/en/brahmali#4.5.7">Kd 10:4.5.7</a>). Since they were part of houses or a compound of private buildings, “refectory” is not a satisfactory rendering. The fact that kitchens are not mentioned separately may mean that they were part of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhattagga</i>, except in monasteries. This is supported by a passage at (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3/en/brahmali#5.3.1">Bu Pj 3:5.3.1</a>) that mentions a cooking implement, a pestle, being stored in a village <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhattagga</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhesajja</i>: “tonic”, “medicine”</h3>
<p>The Pali word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhesajja</i> is broader than the English “medicine”. It includes certain foods that provide nourishment without being considered substantial. In most contexts this latter group concerns a standard set of five non-substantial foods: ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup. Occasionally it also refers to other edibles that are closer to food than medicine proper, such as fats (which are to be mixed with oil) and in one case even rice porridge. I have called these “tonics”, following the precedent set by others, such as Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro and Ajahn Brahm. In other contexts, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhesajja</i> is rendered as “medicine”, including cases where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhesajja</i> is used as an umbrella term for all of the above and cases of medicines used externally.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhojanīya, khādanīya</i>: “cooked food”, “fresh food”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhojanīya</i>, together with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i>, is a core concept of the monastic rules. It is perhaps surprising, then, how difficult it is to render these terms into English. A typical translation of the pair, used for instance by I. B. Horner, is “soft food” and “hard food”, respectively for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i>. This is in turn derived from underlying verbs that mean “to savor” and “to chew”. So presumably the difference in these foods relate to the way they tend to be eaten. Still, it is not obvious that foods to be savored do not also need to be chewed, nor that foods that need chewing cannot also be savored. So, at best “soft food” and “hard food” are no more than convenient approximations. Moreover, “soft food” and “hard food” are quite meaningless in English translation. They do not correspond to any typical division of food we are used to in contemporary Western society.</p>
<p>A more recent rendering for the same pair, used for instance by Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro, is “staple food” and “non-staple food”, respectively. This rendering has the advantage of fitting well with a typical classification of food in English. However, it also has drawbacks. The way <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i>, “staple food”, is interpreted in the Vibhaṅga, it includes foods that were not staples in ancient India, such as meat and fish. We can only conclude that this translation does not properly reflect the usage of the underlying Pali.</p>
<p>Even more recently, Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita has suggested that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> should be rendered as “cooked food” and “uncooked food” (“Analysis of the Bhikkhu Pātimokkha”, p. 193). He bases this suggestion on the fact that the definition of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i> lists foods that are normally cooked, whereas the definition of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> consists of foods that are normally or often served raw. This translation is certainly more meaningful than “soft food” and “hard food”. Now let us compare it to the pair “staple food” and “non-staple food”.</p>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Khādanīya</i> occurs in a number of contexts where “uncooked food” fits better than “non-staple food”. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Khādanīya</i> was often stored in a monastery, whereas there is no indication that this was the case for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i>. For instance, in the origin story to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41/en/brahmali#1.1.1">Bu Pc 41</a>, we find that the Sangha had an abundance of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i>. This food was then distributed in the monastery by an official specifically elected to the task (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#7.12.6">Bu Pj 2:7.12.6</a>), the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khajjakabhājaka</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd16/en/brahmali#21.2.10">Kd 16:21.2.10</a>). Uncooked food could well be stored in this way, whereas this would not be possible with cooked food at a time when there were no means of refrigeration. We find a particularly instructive passage in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37/en/brahmali#1.4">Bu Pc 37</a>, where monks are first given food to eat (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojetvā</i>, “having been made to eat <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i>”), and then given <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> to take away. Again, the cooked/uncooked distinction fits well, but not so much the staple/non-staple duality. Another passage with a similarly suggestive value is found at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc46/en/brahmali#2.11">Bu Pc 46:2.11</a>, where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> is sent to the monastery and then returned to the owners. There is no mention of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i>, and it does seem unlikely cooked food would be treated in this way.</p>
<p>Yet another relevant passage is found in Kd 6, where people are said to bring salt, oil, rice (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>taṇḍula</i>), and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> to the monastery and then store it there (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#33.1.1">Kd 6:33.1.1</a>). Oil and salt are uncooked foods, as is <i translate='no' lang='pli'>taṇḍula</i>, which refers to uncooked rice. (The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>taṇḍula</i> is then cooked, becoming <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhatta</i> or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i>, before it is served to the monks.) Given that all these foods are stored, it is reasonable to infer that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> is also uncooked. Again, the distinction between cooked and uncooked is meaningful, not so much the contrast between staple and non-staple. A similar passage is found earlier on in the same text at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#24.1.2">Kd 6:24.1.2</a>. In this case the same group of foods is loaded onto carts, which then follow behind the Buddha and the monks, apparently for a period of two months or more. This too only makes sense if <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> is uncooked food.</p>
<p>What about counterarguments? In <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc44/en/brahmali#2.1.6">Bi Pc 44</a> <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> is said to be cooked. However, this does not necessarily contradict the idea that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> generally was uncooked or given as uncooked food. Almost any food <em>can</em> be cooked, but certain foods tend to be cooked more often than others, such as rice or meat. It follows that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i> are not exclusive categories, and that some degree of overlap is to be expected.</p>
<p>Then there is the curious lack of mention of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sūpa</i>, a bean-based curry, which was a cooked staple in ancient India, but is not included in the standard definition of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i>. It might be that it was considered too marginal to be included in either <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i> or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i>. Perhaps it was seen as no more than a sauce to spice up the rice.</p>
<p>I conclude that staple/non-staple is not a good match for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhojanīya</i>/<i translate='no' lang='pli'>khādanīya</i>. For this reason, I follow Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita in his rendering of these terms, except I use “fresh” in place of “uncooked”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Magga, amagga</i>: “orifice” or “private part”, “mouth”</h3>
<p>The word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> normally means “path” or “road”, as in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṭṭhaṅgika magga</i>, “the eightfold path”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka, however, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> is sometimes used in a specialized sense.</p>
<p>In part 1 of the permutation series to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pārājika</i> 1, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> explicitly refers to the three orifices—vagina, anus, or mouth—of a female or hermaphrodite partner that a monk might have sexual intercourse with (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.1.9.1">Bu Pj 1:9.1.9.1</a> and (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.1.16">Bu Pj 1:9.1.16</a>). In part 2 of the same permutation series, the text refers to both <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>amagga</i>, but without explaining them (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#9.7.7.1">Bu Pj 1:9.7.7.1</a>–9.7.10). The commentary understands <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> here to have the same meaning as in part 1, whereas it interprets <i translate='no' lang='pli'>amagga</i> to refer to a sore on the body. This interpretation appears to stem from one of the case studies to this rule, which, interestingly, does not actually use the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>amagga</i>.</p>
<p>On the face of it this does seem strange. Part 2 of the permutation series begins with a short summary of offenses committed under this rule, consisting of no more than four short statements. It would be rather extraordinary if the marginal case of sexual intercourse through a sore on the body should appear here. An even more serious problem is that a kiss involving penetration of the mouth would then be a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pārājika</i> offense. There is nothing in the Canonical text to substantiate this, and in fact all the evidence points to this not being the case. The rule itself speaks of sexual intercourse, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>methunadhamma</i>, which is then defined as “genital with genital”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṅgajātena aṅgajātaṁ</i>. It makes no sense to interpret this as including mouth to mouth. In addition, there is no mention in the Vibhaṅga, including the case studies, of any offense for mouth-to-mouth contact, whether penetrative or otherwise. In fact, there is no need to mention mouth-to-mouth cases under this rule because non-genital bodily contact falls squarely under <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/brahmali#1.2.15.1">Bu Ss 2</a>.</p>
<p>Given the above problems, it seems preferable to understand <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> in part 2 of the permutation series as restricted to the genitals and the anus, that is, “private part”, whether of the partner or the monastic. The mouth would then be represented by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>amagga</i>, “non-path” or “non-private part”. This understanding fits with how <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> is used in other contexts. The anus is regularly called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vaccamagga</i>, “the path of feces”, and the genitals <i translate='no' lang='pli'>passāvamagga</i>, “the path of urine”. The mouth, however, with the curious exception of part 1 of the permutation series in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pārājika</i> 1, is never called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i>, whether as a separate word or compounded with some other term. It seems likely that even in part 2 of the present permutation series <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> would be used in the more established sense.</p>
<p>However, there is one further problem. If we do take <i translate='no' lang='pli'>amagga</i> to mean the mouth, the question arises as to why mouth-to-mouth penetration would be a serious offense, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>thullaccaya</i>, and not an offense entailing suspension, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i>. A possible answer is that this rule does not include intention as a subfactor. In other words, if the mouth-to-mouth contact is motivated by lust, then the action would fall under <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghādisesa</i> 2. If there is no lust—perhaps in the case of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation—it would be a serious offense under this rule.</p>
<p>We still need to explain why the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> would be used in such different ways in two closely connected parts of the same rule. To start with, it seems likely that part 2 of the permutation series is earlier than part 1. Part 2 is short and concise, whereas part 1 is long and elaborate. As a general principle of interpretation, it can be assumed that the short and less elaborate section is likely to be earlier. If this is so, then the threefold classification of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> found in part 1 would not yet have existed when part 2 was formulated. In other words, there would have been no contradiction in the text. Later on, when a more detailed exegesis gradually emerged, the shorthand of three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>maggas</i> may have been invented for the purpose of concision. They would no doubt have been aware of the discrepancy, but probably assumed—wrongly it seems!—that it would not be a problem.</p>
<p>I conclude that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> is used in slightly different ways in the two sections. In the first part it refers to the three orifices, whereas in the second part it is restricted to the “private parts”. In interpretating <i translate='no' lang='pli'>magga</i> in this way, I agree with Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro’s “The Buddhist Monastic Code I”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Mattika</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cuṇṇa</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>chakaṇa</i>: “soap”, “bath powder”, “detergent”</h3>
<p>Where required by context, I render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cuṇṇa</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mattika</i>, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>chakaṇa</i> according to function rather than substance. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Cuṇṇa</i> is a powder used for a number of purposes, including medical ones, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mattika</i> is clay. There are several Canonical passages, however, that show them as the two principal substances for cleaning the body. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#25.12.4">Kd 1:25.12.4</a> and a number of similar passages, we find that the two would always be made ready before entering a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jantāghara</i>, a sauna or hot bathroom. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57/en/brahmali#7.1.8">Bu Pc 57:7.1.8</a> bathing is defined as bathing with powder and/or clay. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#27.4.5">Kd 20:27.4.5</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#27.4.12">Kd 20:27.4.12</a> the nuns are prohibited from bathing with powder and scented clay, but should use ordinary clay instead. In the commentaries, we find that clay is used for washing one’s hair.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-38' id='introduction-noteref-38' role='doc-noteref'>38</a></p>
<p>When it comes to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>chakaṇa</i>, literally, “dung”, there are several Canonical and commentarial passages that show it was used as cleaning agent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Chakaṇa</i> is cow dung.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-39' id='introduction-noteref-39' role='doc-noteref'>39</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>chakaṇa</i>, ‘cow dung’, is said for horses, etc., because of the use in regard to stains.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-40' id='introduction-noteref-40' role='doc-noteref'>40</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a particularly clear passage in the Khandha-saṁyutta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Suppose there is a dirty and stained cloth. The owners take it to a dyer. The dyer kneads it with salt or lye or cow dung and then rinses it in clean water.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.89/en/sujato#12.1">SN 22.89:12.1</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A commentarial passage reinforces the point that cow dung is used in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the young boy having himself entered the water, having rubbed with cow dung and clay, he should bathe.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-41' id='introduction-noteref-41' role='doc-noteref'>41</a></p>

<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Māḷa: “</i>stilt house”</h3>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māḷa</i> is hard to distinguish from the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hammiya</i>, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māḷa</i> always occurring together with the other two in the Vinaya. In fact, according to the commentary, they are all different kinds of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>, that is, different kinds of “stilt houses”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māḷa</i> is a square stilt house with (a roof in) a single peak. A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> is a long stilt house. A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hammiya</i> is a stilt house with a bald roof.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-42' id='introduction-noteref-42' role='doc-noteref'>42</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than try to name each of these buildings, which in any case would not be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. For practical purposes, especially in relation to <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np2/en/brahmali#3.4.1">Bu NP 2:3.4.1</a>–3.5.4, what these three buildings have in common is that they do not have an enclosed category, that is, there is nothing to create an enclosure, such a fence or wall. For a discussion of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>, see separate entry in this Appendix.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Yojana</i></h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vadati</i>: “to correct”</h3>
<p>PED gives “to speak, say, tell” as the meanings of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vadati</i>, which is far from comprehensive. An important meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vadati</i>, especially in a Vinaya context, is “to admonish” or “to correct”. This usage, which is common in the Vinaya, is a close parallel to the English expression “to speak to someone”. Here is a clear example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I invite the Sangha concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>vadantu</i>) me, venerables, out of compassion. If I see (a fault), I will make amends.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd4/en/brahmali#1.14.7">Kd 4:1.14.7</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because “admonish” is sometimes considered formal and perhaps a bit dated, I prefer “correct”.</p>
<p>Closely related to the meaning “correct” is the occasional meaning “to accuse”, for instance, at <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu aniyata</i> 1 and 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If she accuses him like this: “I’ve seen you seated, having sexual intercourse with a woman,” and he admits to that, then he is to be dealt with for the offense. (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1/en/brahmali#2.2.4">Bu Ay 1:2.2.4</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these cases, it is perhaps just an alternative form of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>anuvadati</i>, which always means “to accuse” in the Canonical texts. Sometimes <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vadati</i> can also mean “to ask”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The other should ask, “Who is your friend or companion?” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc59/en/brahmali#2.1.25">Bu Pc 59</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vikappanā</i>: “assignment”</h3>
<p>The word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> is hard to pin down. What is clear is that it refers to a requisite somehow being transferred to another monastic. The exact nature of this “transfer”, however, has not been well understood. For instance, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> is sometimes rendered as “shared ownership”, yet there is little evidence in support of this. SED suggests “a distributor, apportioner” for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikalpaka</i>, but again, this does not quite fit the usage in the Vinaya Piṭaka. Yet another rendering favored by some translators is “transfer (of ownership)”. The problem here is that “transfer” suggests a physical change of ownership, which does not seem required by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>. To clear this up, let us have a look at a few suggestive contexts from the Vinaya Piṭaka.</p>
<p>To start with, we need to look at the main Pātimokkha rule that deals with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>, that is, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pācittiya</i> 59. According to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i> to this rule, it is clear that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> refers to a real change of ownership. This is what it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vikappanā</i> in the absence of: one should say, “I give this robe-cloth to you for the purpose of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>.” The other should ask, “Who is your friend or companion?” One should reply, “So-and-so and so-and-so.” The other should say, “I give it to them (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>ahaṁ tesaṁ dammi</i>). Please use their property (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>tesaṁ santakaṁ</i>), give it away, or do as you like with it.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-43' id='introduction-noteref-43' role='doc-noteref'>43</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“<i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vikappanā</i> in the absence of” means that the person one is “transferring to” is not present. The conversation above is between the original owner and a middle person. The sentence “I give this robe-cloth to you for the purpose of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>” refers to the original owner giving the robe-cloth they want to “transfer” to this middle person. This person is then responsible for completing the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> by effecting the transfer with the words “I give it to them”.</p>
<p>Two interesting points emerge from this description. (1) The expressions “I give it to them” and “their property” make it unmistakably clear that we are dealing with a change of ownership. There is no support here for the idea of “shared ownership”. (2) The phrases “please use their property, give it away, or do as you like with it” suggest that the requisite stays in the hands of the original owner. In other words, the idea of a physical “transfer” is equally unsupported.</p>
<p>Putting the two together, we get the impression that the change of ownership is in name only. I will come back to this unusual situation—that is, how there can be a change of ownership without a physical transfer—toward the end of this entry. Before I do so, let us look at some other contexts for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> to find out whether they support this initial analysis.</p>
<p>In the Chapter on Robes, we find a ruling on which requisites are to be determined and which are to be dealt with through <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>:</p>

<p>“You should determine the three robes, not <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> them; you should determine the rainy-season robe for the four months of the rainy season and then <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> it; you should determine the sitting mat, not <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> it; you should determine a sheet, not <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> it; you should determine an itch-covering cloth for as long as you’re sick and then <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> it; you should determine a washcloth, not <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> it; you should determine a cloth for requisites, not <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> it.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-44' id='introduction-noteref-44' role='doc-noteref'>44</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear from this that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> was used for storage of cloth that was not in use. If storage is the purpose of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>, then a physical transfer of the cloth or requisite is presumably not required, perhaps not even desirable. This means that “distribution” or “transference” don’t quite hit the mark, since both of these imply that the new owner gets their hands on the requisite with all the associated powers of ownership, including the ability to use the item as they wish. “Shared ownership” might work, except there is no evidence from any sources that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> can actually have this meaning.</p>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vikappanā</i> is also found in the following standard sequence of terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He determines, he does <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>, he gives away.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-45' id='introduction-noteref-45' role='doc-noteref'>45</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the last of these refers to a physical change of ownership, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> is unlikely to refer to the same thing.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most revealing passage for our purposes is found at <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pācittiya</i> 33, where we find a conversation between the Buddha and Ānanda. The Buddha encourages Ānanda to accept food that is offered to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Buddha said, “Accept it, Ānanda.”—“I can’t, sir, I’m expecting another meal.”—“Well then, Ānanda, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappetvā</i> that meal to someone else and then receive this.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-46' id='introduction-noteref-46' role='doc-noteref'>46</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The context suggests that Ānanda is to “transfer” that other meal to someone who is not present. If the other person were present, they too would be unable to accept the food that was being offered. Moreover, it is clear from this that the rendering “shared ownership” does not work. Ānanda had to give up the other meal entirely to be able to eat where he was. As a follow up, Ānanda would then presumably be obliged to inform the other person of the meal to ensure the donor was not let down.</p>
<p>To sum up our findings so far, it seems that all contexts for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> either support or are compatible with our suggestion that it refers to a change of ownership without a physical transfer. We now need to consider how this is to be understood.</p>
<p>As we have seen above, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pācittiya</i> 59 includes the following two sentences in the section on “<i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> in the absence of”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I give it to them. Please use their property, give it away, or do as you like with it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the intermediary monastic is saying to the original owner that they may do what they wish with the requisite that now has new owners. To get a handle on this, let us first consider the commentarial explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this is said: “Please use so-and-so’s property, give it away, or do as you like with it,” it is relinquishment that is meant.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-47' id='introduction-noteref-47' role='doc-noteref'>47</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary seems to say that this refers to the new owner relinquishing the cloth so that the old owner may use the requisite as they like. This works technically in that it fits with the phrasing of the actual rule. But it does not work well when the two sentences from the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vibhaṅga</i> are considered together, that is, “I give it to them” immediately preceding “Please use their property …”. In the Pali these are said by the same person, which can only be the intermediary monastic, not the new owner. Moreover, there is no indication in the Pali, as one would expect if the requisite changed hands, of a period of storage before the relinquishment happens.</p>
<p>We are compelled to look for an alternative explanation. One possibility is that we are dealing with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vissāsa</i>, “taking on trust”. On this understanding, we have a situation where the intermediary monastic gives the requisite to the new owners and immediately says to the old owner that they may take the item on trust at any time. If this is correct, it becomes clear why, as we find in the rule, the intermediary monastic asks who are the friends and companions of the original owner. The reason for this question is that one can only take on trust from close associates.</p>
<p>This interpretation allows one to do <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> and then keep the item in one’s own possession, before taking it on trust whenever one needs it. The only formality one needs to go through is the initial establishing of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i>. For the conditions for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vissāsa</i>, “taking on trust”, see <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#19.1.5">Kd 8:19.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>We are left with a word that expresses the change of ownership of a requisite, without it necessarily changing hands. In addition, it seems clear that the rendering “shared ownership” does not work. Based on this, I suggest the best translation of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vikappanā</i> is “assignment”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vidatthi</i>: “handspan”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vinaya</i>: “training”</h3>
<p>The word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> has a number of nuances in the Pali Canon. On the one hand it is used in the context of resolving issues within the Sangha, in which case it means something like “resolution”. On the other hand, it is often interpreted as shorthand for the Vinaya Piṭaka, the collection of monastic rules and regulations, that is, the Monastic Law. The latter of these, however, needs to be used with circumspection. It would have taken time for the monastic rules to become a collection in their own right, and thus the Vinaya Piṭaka as a collection would not have existed from the beginning. We need to be careful not to backread a later historical development into the earliest stratum of texts.</p>
<p>The word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> is ubiquitous in the Canonical texts and as such seems to have existed from the earliest period. If it did not mean Monastic Law in this earliest period, what did it mean? An indication is given by the cognate verb <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vineti</i>, which in several places has the unambiguous meaning “to train”. For instance, in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.111/en/sujato#1.3">AN 4.111</a> the verb <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vineti</i> is used to describe the training of a horse. Indeed, in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn107/en/sujato#3.3">MN 107</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn125/en/sujato#15.1">MN 125</a>, the Buddha uses the term <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vineti</i> to describe the full training of a monastic all the way to the final goal of awakening. Moreover, at MN 125 the “training” of a monastic is directly compared to the taming or training of a wild elephant. In these cases, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vineti</i> describes “the training”, that is, the practical side of the Dhamma, the Dhamma being the theory.</p>
<p>That this is an appropriate understanding of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> more generally is clear from a number of other Canonical usages. Significantly, the compound <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhammavinaya</i> is sometimes used about non-Buddhist teachings, e.g. in the Chapter on Nuns, where we find the following interesting passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just as families with many women and few men are easily robbed by thieves, so too, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhammavinaya</i> doesn’t last long on whatever spiritual path where women are allowed to go forth.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#1.6.8">Kd 20:1.6.8</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We find a number of similar passages throughout the Canon, for instance at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.27.1">DN 16</a>. What these passages have in common is that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhammavinaya</i> does not, in these cases, refer specifically to the teachings of the Buddha, but to any spiritual teaching. It follows from this that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> cannot mean the Monastic Law. There is no evidence that other religions or spiritual schools had a Monastic Law that was equivalent to the rules and regulations that we find in the Vinaya Piṭaka. Here is what Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pātimokkha</i> in terms of a word, as well as a code of discipline and the recitation of it, is unique to the Buddhist tradition and no other Indian religious traditions, such as the Jain tradition (which has <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sūtra</i>s with rules but no Pātimokkha recitation or the like) have anything corresponding to it; see Dutt 72. (“Analysis of the Bhikkhu Pātimokkha”, p. 46.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can only conclude that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> in these contexts does not refer to a legal framework or anything of that nature. It must refer to something else, most likely the general idea of “training”, as we have seen above. In fact, this understanding is quite natural. All religions had a certain theoretical framework, their <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhamma</i>, as well as a practical application of that framework, their <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i>. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhammavinaya</i> thus comes to stand for theory and praxis, that is, the whole of the religious life, and thus I render it as “spiritual path”.</p>
<p>Over time, however, as the number of rules and regulations grew, this general sense of “training” got narrowed down to mean a fixed Monastic Law. In this way, Vinaya becomes a reference to the Monastic Law as a collection of scriptures. We find examples of this in the Canonical texts themselves, e.g. in the Chapter on the Cancellation of the Monastic Code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before accusing another, a monk should consider, “Have I properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; have I analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition? Is this quality found in me or not?” If it’s not, then when he’s asked, “Where was this said by the Buddha?” he won’t be able to reply. And there will be those who say, “Please learn the Monastic Law first.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd19/en/brahmali#5.1.20">Kd 19:5.1.20</a>–5.1.24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> seems to be equivalent to the two Pātimokkhas together with their analyses, that is, roughly what is now the Mahā-vibhaṅga and the Bhikkhunī-vibhaṅga. We are seeing the beginning of the formation of a collection of texts. The fact that this usage is found in a Canonical text, however, does not necessarily mean that the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> is always a reference to the Canonical text. Given the above considerations, it is more likely that the Vinaya Piṭaka itself is a chronologically stratified text, where we can see the development over time of certain terminology. I suggest, then, that the meaning of the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vinaya</i> is an example of such development.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vibbhamati</i>: “to disrobe”</h3>
<p>According to PED and SED the general meaning of this word is something like “to go astray”. However, the implied meaning throughout the Vinaya Piṭaka is that one leaves the Sangha, that is, one disrobes. I therefore take this word to express the functional equivalence of disrobing. This is supported by the commentaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vibbhamanti</i>: some became householders.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-48' id='introduction-noteref-48' role='doc-noteref'>48</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Yadeva sā vibbhantā</i> means she is no longer a nun because, according to her own preference and choice, she dresses in white.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-49' id='introduction-noteref-49' role='doc-noteref'>49</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vihāra: “</i>a (monastic) dwelling”, “meditation”</h3>
<p>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vihāra</i> is a dwelling, the idea that it is a monastic dwelling being implied. In later usage, especially in the commentaries, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vihāra</i> comes to refer to entire monasteries, rather than individual dwellings. However, the commentaries seem to agree that in its early usage the word does refer to a dwelling: <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vihāro nivesanasadiso</i>, “A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vihāra</i> is like a house.” (Sp 1.493)</p>
<p>In other contexts, especially in the Suttas, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vihāra</i> can refer to meditation or specific states of meditation such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jhānas</i>, for instance in the phrase <i translate='no' lang='pli'>diṭṭhadhammasukhavihāra</i>, “a happy (meditation) abiding in this very life”. Similarly, in the Vinaya we encounter the phrase <i translate='no' lang='pli'>phāsuvihārika</i>. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Phāsu</i> means “comfortable” or “at ease”, and so we have “one who dwells at ease”, that is, “one whose meditation is going well”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Saṅghāṭi</i>: “outer robe”, “upper robe”, “robe”</h3>
<p>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> is normally understood to refer to one of the three robes of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu</i> or one of the five of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i>. It can then be translated as “outer robe” to distinguish it from the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uttarāsaṅga</i>, the upper robe, and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antaravāsaka</i>, the lower robe or sarong.</p>
<p>“Outer robe”, however, is not always a satisfactory rendering of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>, as can be seen from a number of different contexts in the Vinaya Piṭaka. There are in fact three different uses of the word, ranging in meaning from “robe” in general to “upper robe”—denoting either the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uttarāsaṅga</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>, or both—to “outer robe”, which is the only case when it specifically refers an individual robe. That there is such a diversity in meaning can be seen from the following passages in the Vinaya.</p>
<p>There are two rules in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhikkhunī Pātimokkha</i> that mention <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8/en/brahmali#2.1.14">Bi Pj 8</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc24/en/brahmali#2.1.5">Bi Pc 24</a>. In the former case the Vibhaṅga explains <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nivatthaṁ vā pārutaṁ vā</i>, “dressed below and dressed above”, which are the standard words for dressing in a sarong and an upper robe respectively.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-50' id='introduction-noteref-50' role='doc-noteref'>50</a> In this case, it seems any of the three or five robes are intended. In the latter case, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> is in fact explained as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pañca cīvarāni</i>, “the five robes”, that is, any of the five robes used by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunīs</i>. From this I conclude that in certain contexts <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> should simply be rendered as “robe”.</p>
<p>Bhikkhunī Vimalañāṇī (private communication) has shown that parallel rules preserved in other Vinayas “strongly supports” the idea that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> often just means “robe”. The following is a summary of her findings.</p>
<p>There are two Pali <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> rules that mention the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>: Bi Pj 8 and Bi Pc 24.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chinese parallels for Bi Pj 8 all say “robe”, except the Mūlasarvāstivāda, which in both Chinese and Tibetan does not mention this factor. In addition, the Hybrid Sanskrit text of the Lokuttaravāda also says “robe” (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>).</li>
<li>As for Bi Pc 24, four Vinayas (Mahīśāsaka, Sarvāstivāda, and Mūlasarvāstivāda in both Chinese and Tibetan) say “robes” (although there is some confusion in the translation of the Tibetan). The Dharmaguptaka is alone in specifying a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>; it says that other robes incur a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dukkaṭa</i> offense. The Lokuttaravāda and Mahāsāṁghika do not have this rule.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conversely, there are two rules that mention <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> in some other Vinayas, but <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i> in the Pali.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pali Bi Pc 23 mentions the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>, as do the Mahīśāsaka and Sarvāstivāda parallels. However, the Dharmaguptaka, Lokuttaravāda, and Mahāsāṁghika parallels have <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>. The Mūlasarvāstivāda omits this rule.</li>
<li>Pali Bi NP 3 also includes <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>, followed by the Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka, and Sarvāstivāda. The Lokuttaravāda and Mahāsāṁghika, however, have <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>, with the Lokuttaravāda word definition identifying the two (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṁghāṭī ti cīvaraṁ</i>). Again, the Mūlasarvāstivāda has no parallel.</li>
</ul>
<p>We see two patterns in the Chinese translations of the Vinaya. First, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> is often defined as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>. Second, where one version of the Vinaya uses <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> another may well use <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>. Both of these patterns suggest that the two were sometimes used interchangeably. (I take it that “robe” is a translation of a Chinese term that ultimately refers to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>.)</p>
<p>Now let us look at the other meanings of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi.</i> In the Khandhakas we find <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> used in the plural, but in a context that excludes the sarong. In Kd 1, in the context of a student’s duties to their preceptor or teacher, the student puts the two <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭis</i> together and then hands them as one to the teacher (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#25.9.1">Kd 1:25.9.1</a>). This cannot refer to the sarong because the teacher is specifically said to have put it on just before. The student is then said to dress in the same manner. Moreover, in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96/en/brahmali#1.3">Bi Pc 96</a>, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭis</i> (plural) of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī</i> are lifted up by a whirlwind and the upper part of her body is exposed, while nothing is said of the lower part.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are a few of contexts where the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> is specifically distinguished from the other two robes, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>uttarāsaṅga</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>antaravāsaka</i>, for instance at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np2/en/brahmali#3.1.5">Bu NP 2:3.1.5</a>.</p>
<p>We are thus left with three different meanings of the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i>. In practice, there are a number of passages in the Vinaya Piṭaka where the precise meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> cannot be decided with certainty. In such cases one needs to make the most of the context to decide which meaning is the most likely. To sum up, I translate <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> in three different ways, as either “robe”, “upper robe”, or “outer robe”. And I use the context to decide which one is appropriate in each particular case.</p>
<p>There is perhaps one additional criterion that can be used in rendering this term. In the above analysis it can be seen that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> ranges from the generic term “robe” via the less general “upper robe” to the specific “outer robe”. It seems reasonable to assume that these three meanings were not used interchangeably at all historical stages, but that a certain meaning predominated at any specific time. The question, then, is whether we can discern a development in usage over time.</p>
<p>It seems likely to me that the more general meaning would have been the earlier one, whereas the more specific meanings developed later. It is natural for any institution such as Buddhism to start off with a less specialized vocabulary, mostly inherited from the broader society, including existing religions, and then gradually develop its own specialized terminology. This seems to be no more than the natural way in which any organization tends to develop. If this is correct, then the more generic meaning of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>saṅghāṭi</i> would be the earlier one, whereas the most specific meaning would be the latest. We may then ascribe the more generic meaning to the earliest parts of the texts, such as the Pātimokkha rules, and the more specialized meaning to the later parts, such as the explanatory material. This gives an additional criterion for deciding the translation at any particular point.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sattu</i>: “flour products”</h3>
<p>“Flour products” renders <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sattu</i>. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sattu</i> is sometimes translated as “flour” or “meal”. Basing myself on the commentary, I take it that flour products, such as baked goods, are included in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sattu</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sattu</i>: means flour made of rice or cereals. Having roasted millet, beans, or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kudrūsa</i>, having pounded a little, having removed the husk, again having pounded strongly, they make powder. Also, if because of wetness it is lumped into one, it is still reckoned as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sattu</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-51' id='introduction-noteref-51' role='doc-noteref'>51</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commenting on Bu Pc 34, the sub-commentary Kkh-pṭ says, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sattūti baddhasattu, abaddhasattu ca</i>, “sattu means bound flour and unbound flour”, which would seem to refer to products made of flour and loose flour, respectively. Also, commenting on Bu Pc 34, another sub-commentary adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sattu</i>: the taking of flour, whether made into goods or not; sesame, etc., which are characterized by this.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-52' id='introduction-noteref-52' role='doc-noteref'>52</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Santhata</i>: “blanket”</h3>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>santhata</i> is a cloth requisite that is used as an underlay for sitting or lying on,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-53' id='introduction-noteref-53' role='doc-noteref'>53</a> as a blanket to keep one warm,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-54' id='introduction-noteref-54' role='doc-noteref'>54</a> or as a fourth robe.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-55' id='introduction-noteref-55' role='doc-noteref'>55</a> The commentarial explanation of how a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>santhata</i> is made seems to suggest it was quite thick:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is made by spreading layer upon layer (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>uparūpari</i>) of silk thread on an even stretch of ground, and sprinkling with rice water etc.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-56' id='introduction-noteref-56' role='doc-noteref'>56</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, thickness alone is not what distinguishes a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>santhata</i> from a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>, the usual word for a monastic robe. In the Vinaya there is no limit to the thickness or material quality of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>cīvara</i>, which means that all types of woven cloth can be classified under this word. The reason for the separate category of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>santhata</i>, then, would seem to be that it is not woven cloth. Indeed, in the Vinaya Piṭaka the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>santhata</i> is always defined by its method of production, which, as we have just seen, is then described in greater detail in the commentary. It is a kind of unwoven cloth.</p>
<p>Yet the specific way a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>santhata</i> was made does not seem to be in use in modern societies. It follows that defining a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>santhata</i> strictly according to the way it is manufactured would make all rules relating to it defunct, specifically <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np11/en/brahmali#1.23.1">Bu NP 11</a>–15. It therefore seems preferable to classify it according to its usage. It is for this reason I have chosen the rendering “blanket”, which means that these rules are relevant also in a modern context.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Samānasaṁvāsa/samānasaṁvāsako: “</i>who belongs to the same community” “one who belongs to the same Buddhist sect”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Samānasaṁvāsaka</i> (and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nānāsaṁvāsaka</i>) need to be carefully distinguished from <i translate='no' lang='pli'>samānasaṁvāsa</i> (and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nānāsaṁvāsa</i>). Only the former means “one belonging to the same Buddhist sect”. The latter means “belonging to the same community”, as decided by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmās</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sambahula</i>: “several”, “three”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sambahula</i> normally means “many” or “a number of”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka, however, it is also used technically to mean a number of monastics greater than one but less than a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sangha</i>, in other words, two or three monastics. For instance, in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>nissaggiya pācittiya</i> rules, a monastic who has breached a rule relinquishes the item in question to a single monastic, to <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sambahula</i> monastics, or to a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sangha</i>. In these and similar instances I render <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sambahula</i> as “several”.</p>
<p>In the Chapter Connected with Campā (Kd 9), <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sambahula</i> is used in an even more restricted sense. Here it refers to more than two monastics but less than a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sangha</i>, that is, exactly three monastics. In this context I render it simply as “three”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sālā</i>: “building”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sālā</i> is etymologically related to the English word “hall” and is often translated as such. In some contexts, this may be appropriate, but <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i> is in fact used more broadly than “hall”, referring to buildings of all sizes. At the lower end of the spectrum, it refers to small buildings, probably no more than sheds, for instance, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aggisālā</i>, “water-boiling shed”, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>udapānasāla</i>, “well house”, and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pānīyasālā</i>, “drinking-water shed”. Buildings that were presumably intermediate in size, were also called <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i>, such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kathinasālā</i>, “sewing shed”, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jantāgharasālā</i>, “sauna”, and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>āpaṇasālā</i>, “shop”. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sālā</i> also includes buildings that would have been quite substantial, such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>upaṭṭhānasālā</i>, “assembly hall”, and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mahāsālās</i>, “large houses”, of wealthy people. In this latter usage <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i> seems to be indistinguishable from a “house”. We may deduce from this that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kūṭāgārasālā</i> of Vesālī, where the Buddha often stayed, should probably be rendered simply as “the house with a peaked roof”. In addition to this, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i> covers large but simple buildings, such as <i translate='no' lang='pli'>caṅkamasālā</i>, “covered walking path”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gosālā</i>, “cow shed”, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>assasālā</i>, “horse stable”, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hatthisālā</i>, “elephant stable”.</p>
<p>Apart from the issue of size, there is no indication that a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i> had to consist of a single room, as implied by the rendering “hall”. Another piece of evidence is found in <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31/en/brahmali#3.1.6">Bu Pc 31</a> where the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i> as a venue for eating is contrasted with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>maṇḍapa</i>, “roof cover”, and open-air venues such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>rukkhamūla</i>, “the foot of a tree”, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>ajjhokāsa</i>, “out in the open”. In this last instance, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i> seems to be a generic reference to an indoor venue. Given this diversity in usage, it seems <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sālā</i>, in its generic sense, may best be rendered as “building”. In more specific circumstances, I render it according to context.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sīmā</i>: “(monastery) zone”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sīmā</i> is commonly rendered as “boundary”. It is perhaps worth noting straightaway that there is another Pali word that unambiguously means “boundary”, namely, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>mariyāda</i>. With <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>, however, the situation is more equivocal. There is in fact some evidence in the Canonical texts that “area” is closer to the mark. At Kd 2, we find the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A whole river, a whole ocean, or a whole lake cannot be a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> in its own right.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#12.7.3">Kd 2:12.7.3</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these cases, it is more intuitive to think of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> as the area of the lake, etc., not as its boundary. A little bit earlier in the same <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khandhaka</i>, we find the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You shouldn’t establish a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> that is too large, whether 50, 65, or 80 kilometers across. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should establish a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> that is 40 kilometers across at the most.” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali#7.1.6">Kd 2:7.1.6</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not immediately obvious what the distances here refer to. If a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> is to be regarded as a “boundary”, then it would be natural to see these distances as the length of the boundary. According to the commentary, however, the distances here are the maximum lengths <em>across</em> the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i> at the most: here three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i> at the most is its measure. This is three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i> at the most. One who is establishing (a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>), standing in the middle, should establish (a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>) that is one and a half <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i> in the four directions. If, standing in the middle, one makes it three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i> in each direction, it will be six <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i>, which is not allowable. One who is establishing (a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>) that is quadrangular or triangular should establish (a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>) that is three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i> corner to corner. If one exceeds three <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i> even by a hair’s breadth on any side, one commits an offense and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> is not actually a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-57' id='introduction-noteref-57' role='doc-noteref'>57</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this suggests that “area” is a better fit for <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> than “boundary”. In fact, the word “zone” is probably more accurate than “area”. A zone is normally understood as an area used for a specific purpose, in this case to delimit the precise extent of a monastery.</p>
<p>A complicating factor is that the word <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> is used for all sorts of areas, not just those concerned with monasteries. For instance, there are <i translate='no' lang='pli'>gāmasīmās</i>, “village zones” or “zones of inhabited areas”. To avoid confusion, when <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sīmā</i> refers specifically to the area of a monastery, I therefore usually render it as “monastery zone”, or where the meaning is self-evident, simply as “zone”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sugata</i>: “standard”</h3>
<p>In contrast to the Suttas, where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> is used as an epithet of the Buddha, in the Vinaya Piṭaka it is mostly used in combination with various measures, such as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugatavidatthi</i>, the “<i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> handspan”. This might be rendered literally as the handspan of the Buddha, but the question is whether this is too literal. The Vinaya Piṭaka contains the same measures both with and without the prefix <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>. These measures are based on the body, in particular the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṅgula</i> (the “finger-breadth”), the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vidatthi</i>, (the “handspan”), and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hattha</i>, (the “forearm”), the latter being found mostly in later literature. Measures based purely on the body are obviously going to be quite imprecise. It would seem likely, then, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> was added to give more precision to these measures, that is, to give a standard. The question is what kind of standard.</p>
<p>It might seem natural to conclude that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> standard is a direct reference to the bodily measures of the Buddha. Yet, is it likely that the monastic community actually measured the Buddha? And even if it did, how long would such measures have survived after the Buddha’s death? Could it be that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures instead were standards <em>laid down</em> by the Buddha, or at least attributed to him? This latter possibility gains some credence when we consider the following passage from Kauṭilya’s Arthaśāstra:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>angula</i> [‘finger-breadth’] or the middlemost joint of the middle finger of a man of medium size may be taken to be equal to an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>angula</i>. … 12 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>angulas</i> are equal to 1 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vitasti</i> … 2 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vitastis</i> are equal to 1 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aratni</i> or 1 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>prājāpatya hasta</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-58' id='introduction-noteref-58' role='doc-noteref'>58</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These measures, including the relationships between them, correspond closely to what we find in the Vinaya Piṭaka, the exception being that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> is replaced by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>prājāpati</i>. According to Patrick Olivelle,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-59' id='introduction-noteref-59' role='doc-noteref'>59</a> the Kauṭilya Arthaśāstra was composed and edited in the period 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE to 3<sup>rd</sup> century CE. These dates overlap reasonably well with dates of composition and editing of the Vinaya Piṭaka, especially if we assume that the ideas described in the Arthaśāstra existed in Indian culture prior to its composition. It seems plausible, then, that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures were modeled on the existing Indian tradition.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above quote, the existing tradition based its measures on <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Prājāpati</i>, the ancient Indian creator god. Clearly this cannot refer to the actual measures of this god, but rather must refer to a standard. It could be, for instance, that these measures were seen as <em>laid down</em> by <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Prājāpati</i>. Or it could be that they were regarded as the actual measures of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Prājāpati</i>, but even so it would be a standard, since no actual measurement of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Prājāpati</i> would be possible.</p>
<p>I am suggesting the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures were based on this pre-existing norm and should be understood through the same paradigm: as measures <em>laid down</em> by the Buddha. In this way they become standards, which were not necessarily directly associated with or even related to the physical measures of the Buddha.</p>
<p>It is in this light, I believe, that the commentarial understanding of the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures being three times the size of an ordinary man must be understood.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-60' id='introduction-noteref-60' role='doc-noteref'>60</a> If taken literally, this idea makes a mockery of the Pali commentaries. Anyone who knows the early Suttas will be aware that such ideas are flagrantly opposed to how the Buddha is portrayed. It is hard to imagine that the commentaries were unaware of this. It seems more likely that the commentaries regarded the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures as standards, which then explains, at least in part, how they could end up with such large numbers.</p>
<p>Given the uncertainties involved, I translate <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata-vidatthi</i> as “standard handspan” and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata-aṅgula</i> as “standard fingerbreadth”. Rather than come up with precise numbers, it seems that broader criteria from the Vinaya—such as not being indulgent or luxurious—should be used to decide what is appropriate in specific instances. Additionally, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures are usually used to denote maximum allowable sizes, and as such they must have been quite ample to be suitable for all monastics. Both the Buddha and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Prājāpati</i> can perhaps be regarded as kings writ large, in the sense that “king size” normally denotes a particularly large measure. I would therefore propose that the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures should be understood in such a way that all monastics would be able to live comfortably within them.</p>
<p>For those who prefer exact numbers, I will provide a brief example of how some of the ancient Indian measures might be estimated, if only very approximately.</p>
<p>Apart from the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i> measures, there are also a significant number of cases where measures of length are not prefixed with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>. To get an estimate of these measures, I start by assuming that they are the measures of an average man, as suggested by the commentaries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The standard handspan (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugatavidatthi</i>): three handspans (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>vidatthi</i>) of an average (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>majjhima</i>) person now are called a standard handspan.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-61' id='introduction-noteref-61' role='doc-noteref'>61</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Eight fingerbreadths of the standard fingerbreadth: three fingerbreadths of an average man now are here called a standard fingerbreadth.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-62' id='introduction-noteref-62' role='doc-noteref'>62</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, we need an estimate of the height of an average man. According to research at the University of Tuebingen,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-63' id='introduction-noteref-63' role='doc-noteref'>63</a> an average Indian man in 1840 was 160 centimeters tall. According to the website “Our World in Data”,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-64' id='introduction-noteref-64' role='doc-noteref'>64</a> human height was essentially stable before the modern era, which means we can assume, very roughly, that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was 160 centimeters. Additionally, if we follow the commentarial tradition that the forearm (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>hattha</i>) is one quarter the length of a person’s height,<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-65' id='introduction-noteref-65' role='doc-noteref'>65</a> we have a forearm measure of 40 cm. Based on this, we can estimate other measures, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vidatthi</i> = 20 cm. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vidatthi</i>, the “hand-span”, is half the length of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hattha</i>.</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aṅgula</i> = 1.67 cm, which gives roughly 3.5 cm for 2 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṅgulas</i> and 7 cm for 4 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṅgulas</i>. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aṅgula</i>, the “finger-breadth”, is one twelfth of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vidatthi</i>.</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhanu</i> = 1.6 m, which gives 800 m for 500 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhanus</i>. The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>dhanu</i>, the “bow-length”, is equal to four <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hatthas</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-66' id='introduction-noteref-66' role='doc-noteref'>66</a></li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Abbhantara</i> = 11.2 m, which gives almost 80 m for 7 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>abbhantaras</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-67' id='introduction-noteref-67' role='doc-noteref'>67</a> The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>abbhantara</i> is equal to 28 <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hatthas</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then there is the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojana</i>, an important measure of distances related to travel on land. Unfortunately, there is much uncertainty about this measure, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. Still, in his book on ancient Indian measures, T. W. Rhys Davids estimates the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojana</i> at 8 miles or approximately 13 kilometers.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-68' id='introduction-noteref-68' role='doc-noteref'>68</a> I follow Rhys Davids, but due to the uncertainties involved, I use round numbers when calculating distances of two or more <i translate='no' lang='pli'>yojanas</i>.</p>
<p>In sum, we have the following estimates for the various measures used in the Vinaya Piṭaka:</p>
<ul>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Aṅgula</i> = 1.67 cm</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sugataṅgula</i> = 5 cm</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vidatthi</i> = 20 cm</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Sugatavidatthi</i> = 60 cm</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Hattha</i> = 40 cm</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Dhanu</i> = 1.8 m</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Abbhantara</i> = 11.2 m</li>
<li><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Yojana</i> = 13 km.</li>
</ul>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Suvaṇṇa</i>: “gold”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Senāsana</i>: “resting place”, “dwelling”, “furniture”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Senāsana</i>, literally “bed and seat”, refers broadly to any kind of “resting place”, ranging from huts to furniture and bedding, including even resting places at the foot of a tree.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-69' id='introduction-noteref-69' role='doc-noteref'>69</a> It can also mean an individual resting place within a single dwelling (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali#13.8.3">Kd 5:13.8.3</a>–13.8.6). This broad range of meaning is confirmed by the sub-commentary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are four kinds of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>senāsana</i>: the dwelling <i translate='no' lang='pli'>senāsana</i>, the bed-and-bench <i translate='no' lang='pli'>senāsana</i>, the bedding (or “mat”) <i translate='no' lang='pli'>senāsana</i>, the place <i translate='no' lang='pli'>senāsana.</i> … Wherever monks retire to, all that is called “<i translate='no' lang='pli'>senāsana</i>”.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-70' id='introduction-noteref-70' role='doc-noteref'>70</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is almost impossible to capture this range of meaning in a single English word, with the possible exception of “resting place”. In practice, however, “resting place” is often too vague to be properly meaningful. For this reason, I vary my translation according to context, using “dwelling”, “furniture”, and “resting place” as appropriate.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Hattha</i>: “forearm”</h3>
<p>See <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sugata</i>.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Hammiya: “</i>a stilt house”</h3>
<p>In the Vinaya Piṭaka, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hammiya</i> is normally grouped with either the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>māḷa</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>, or with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aḍḍhayoga</i> and the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i>. According to the commentaries, all these buildings are different kinds of “stilt houses”. Rather than try to differentiate between them, which is not necessary from a practical perspective, I have grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> is a long stilt house. A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hammiya</i> is just a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-71' id='introduction-noteref-71' role='doc-noteref'>71</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“An <i translate='no' lang='pli'>aḍḍhayoga</i> is a house bent like a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>supaṇṇa</i>.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-72' id='introduction-noteref-72' role='doc-noteref'>72</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“A house bent like a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>supaṇṇa</i>: a house made in the shape of the wings of a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garuḷa</i>.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-73' id='introduction-noteref-73' role='doc-noteref'>73</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garuḷa</i>, better known in its Sanskrit form <i translate='no' lang='pli'>garuḍa</i>, is a mythological bird.</p>
<p>At Sp-ṭ 3.74 we find slightly different explanations. It is clear, however, that all three are stilt houses that are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess. See also <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda</i> in this same Appendix.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Hirañña</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i>: “gold coin” or “money”, “gold”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Suvaṇṇa</i>, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i>, and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jātarūpa</i> are closely related, all referring to gold in one way or another. It seems, however, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> is used in a slightly different way from the other two. At <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#5.6.22">Bu Pj 1:5.6.22</a>, Sudinna’s parents make one pile of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i> and one of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i>. The use of two different words seems to necessitate that the piles are not exactly the same. According to the commentary <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> here refers to money, presumably gold coins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> should be understood as the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kahāpaṇa</i> coin.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-74' id='introduction-noteref-74' role='doc-noteref'>74</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This commentarial interpretation fits with how <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> is used elsewhere in the Vinaya. In the Chapter on Robes (Kd 8), we find that doctors are paid in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i>; in the Chapter on Resting Places (Kd 16), Anāthapiṇḍika pays Prince Jeta in <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> for the Jeta Grove; and in the Chapter on the Group of Seven Hundred (Kd 22) the monks ask for money and get <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i>.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-75' id='introduction-noteref-75' role='doc-noteref'>75</a> In all these cases, the context suggests that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> was used as money, that is, they were gold coins.</p>
<p>In most other cases of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> as found in the Vinaya Pitaka, it is paired with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i>. For instance, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhu pārājika</i> 1 mentions a number of different temptations that might entice a monastic to disrobe, among them <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i> (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#8.2.73">Bu Pj 1:8.2.73</a>). If <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> means gold coins, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i> must refer to gold in some other form, otherwise it hard to see why they are both mentioned. In fact, all cases in the Vinaya where <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i> are used side by side are such that we must conclude that they refer to gold in different forms.</p>
<p>The evidence suggests that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i>/<i translate='no' lang='pli'>sovaṇṇa</i> refers to gold in a more general sense. For instance, at Kd 6 we find the expressions <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇamālā</i>, “a golden garland” and <i translate='no' lang='pli'>pāsāda suvaṇṇa</i>, “a stilt house made of gold” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#15.6.4">Kd 6:15.6.4</a> and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#15.8.6">Kd 6:15.8.6</a>). At <i translate='no' lang='pli'>bhikkhunī pācittiya</i> 1, we find the phrase <i translate='no' lang='pli'>sabbasovaṇṇamayā pattā</i>, “all feathers made of gold” (<a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1/en/brahmali#1.29">Bi Pc 1:1.29</a>), and in the Khandhakas we find a number of other things made of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i>/<i translate='no' lang='pli'>sovaṇṇa</i>. In most of the remaining cases, <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i> is paired either with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> or <i translate='no' lang='pli'>jātarūpa</i>, both of which mean money, suggesting, once again, that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i> must mean something else, that is, gold in all usages except as coins.</p>
<p>From the above I conclude that <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i> means gold coins in all contexts, whereas <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i> means gold in general. This is true even for Bu Ss 2, where we find the following definition in connection with the offense for physical contact: “Hair: just the hair; or the hair with strings in it, with a garland, with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>hirañña</i>, with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suvaṇṇa</i>, with pearls, or with gems.”<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-76' id='introduction-noteref-76' role='doc-noteref'>76</a> The commentary confirms this distinction between the two terms, with the implication that women used gold coins in their hair as an adornment.<a epub:type='noteref' href='#introduction-note-77' id='introduction-noteref-77' role='doc-noteref'>77</a> This might seem unlikely, except that this is done in India to the present day! In conclusion, I vary my translation between “money” and “gold coins” dependent on what is appropriate in any given context.</p>

<p>The Canonical texts nevertheless make a distinction between a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i> and an <i translate='no' lang='pli'>itthipaṇḍaka</i>, the latter meaning “a female <i translate='no' lang='pli'>paṇḍaka</i>”, see <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/brahmali#3.1.32">Bu Ss 2:3.1.32</a>, <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss5/en/brahmali#5.2.8">Bu Ss 5:5.2.8</a>, and <a href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali#17.1.2">Kd 20:17.1.2</a>. And so it seems that although they were not regarded as fully male or female, they were still considered as closer to one gender or the other.

<p>Erdosy (1988) has a detailed discussion of a large number of archaeological excavations in the Allahabad district in the Ganges plane, relating to urbanization in the period 600–350 BCE. On p. 59 he states that “The dominant settlement in the hierarchy was Kausambi, whose size, estimated as 50 hectares, and elaborate fortification place it in a separate category.” On p. 45 he assumes a population density of 160 people per hectare. Taken together, we can estimate the population of Kausambi at the time of the Buddha as around 8,000 people. According to the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (DN 16), Kausambi was one of the six great cities of ancient India. We can infer, then, a population size of approximately 10,000 people for the largest cities in the Ganges plane at that time. <a epub:type='backlink' href='#introduction-noteref-35' role='doc-backlink'>↩</a></p>
