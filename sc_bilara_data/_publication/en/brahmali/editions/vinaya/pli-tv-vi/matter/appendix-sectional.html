<h1>Appendix II: Specialized Vocabulary (used to section the Pali text)</h1>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kaṇḍa</i>: “a chapter”</h3>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Kucchi</i>: “core”</h3>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kucchi</i> permutation series is the first, and thus the “core”, in a series of very similar permutations. It is contrasted with a number of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭṭhi</i> permutation series, which are all subsequent, or “additional”, to the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kucchi</i> series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sp 1.240: <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Tato paraṁ sabbapacchimapadaṁ nīlādīhi navahi padehi saddhiṁ yojetvā kucchicakkaṁ nāma vuttaṁ.</i><br>
“After this, all the subsequent words, having combined the nine words starting with blue, etc.—this is called the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kucchi</i> permutation series.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Khaṇḍa</i>: “unconnected”</h3>
<p>The basic idea of <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khaṇḍa</i> is “broken”. It is used with permutation series to show a series that does not link back to the first item of a series, that is, it is does not form a complete circle or loop, thus being “unconnected”. <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Khaṇḍa</i> contrasts with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>baddha</i>, which refers to a complete circle, that is, a “linked” permutation series. (<i translate='no' lang='pli'>Khaṇḍa</i> is also a commentarial term for a section of a monastic robe.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sp 1.200: <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Tato paṭhamañca jhānaṁ, dutiyañca jhānanti evaṁ paṭhamajjhānena saddhiṁ ekamekaṁ padaṁ ghaṭentena sabbapadāni ghaṭetvā teneva vitthārena khaṇḍacakkaṁ nāma vuttaṁ. Tañhi puna ānetvā paṭhamajjhānādīhi na yojitaṁ, tasmā “khaṇḍacakka”nti vuccati.</i><br>
“Beginning with ʻthe first absorption and the second absorption,’ in this way having connected all the steps by connecting each step with the first absorption, just by that expansion it is called ʻan unconnected permutation series’. It is called ʻan unconnected permutation series’ because it is not, having again brought it back, connected with the first absorption, etc.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gamana</i>: “a round”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Gamana</i> is used in the permutation series to denote a section in a series of sections that are based on the same template.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Cakka</i>: “a permutation series”</h3>
<p>A technical exposition that sets out the various combinations of factors in which a rule applies.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Pali</i>: “a Canonical text”</h3>
<p>As used by the commentaries.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Piṭṭhi</i>: “additional”</h3>
<p>The <i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭṭhi</i> permutation series contrast with the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kucchi</i> permutation series, which is the first in the sequence. In this way, the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kucchi</i> series is the “core”, whereas the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭṭhi</i> series are “additional”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sp 1.240: <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Tato pītakādīni nava padāni ekena nīlapadeneva saddhiṁ yojetvā piṭṭhicakkaṁ nāma vuttaṁ. Tato lohitakādīni nava padāni ekena pītakapadeneva saddhiṁ yojetvā dutiyaṁ piṭṭhicakkaṁ vuttaṁ. Evaṁ lohitakapadādīhi saddhiṁ itarāni nava nava padāni yojetvā aññānipi aṭṭha cakkāni vuttānīti evaṁ dasagatikaṁ piṭṭhicakkaṁ veditabbaṁ.</i><br>
“After this, having combined the nine words starting with yellow with the one word blue—this is called the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭṭhi</i> permutation series. After this, having combined the nine words starting with red with the one word yellow—this is called the second <i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭṭhi</i> permutation series. In this way, having combined each next group of nine words with the word red, etc., eight other permutation series are mentioned, thus the ten-fold <i translate='no' lang='pli'>piṭṭhi</i> permutation series is to be known.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Peyyāla</i>: “successive”, “repetition”</h3>
<p>Often equivalent to etcetera in English.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Baddha</i>: “linked”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Baddha</i> contrasts with <i translate='no' lang='pli'>khaṇḍa</i>, which refers to a permuation series that is “unconnected” in the sense of not forming a complete loop. A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>baddhacakka</i>, “a linked permutation series”, forms a complete loop, linking back to the first item of the series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sp 1.200: <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Tato dutiyañca jhānaṁ, tatiyañca jhānanti evaṁ dutiyajjhānena saddhiṁ ekamekaṁ padaṁ ghaṭetvā puna ānetvā paṭhamajjhānena saddhiṁ sambandhitvā teneva vitthārena baddhacakkaṁ nāma vuttaṁ.</i><br>
“Then, ‘the second absorption and the third absorption<i translate='no' lang='pli'>’</i>, having thus joined the words one by one with the second absorption, having brought it back again, having bound it together with the first absorption, a <i translate='no' lang='pli'>baddha</i> permutation series is spoken of through that detail.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bhāṇavāro</i>: “a section for recitation”</h3>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Bheda</i>: “a subdivision”</h3>
<p>Only used in this way in the Parivāra.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Mūla</i>: “basis”</h3>
<p>Used in repetition series to denote a basic pattern to be followed.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Mūlaka</i>: “based on”</h3>
<p>Used in repetition series to denote the number of items that form the basis for the series.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vagga</i>: “a division”, “a subchapter”</h3>
<p>A <i translate='no' lang='pli'>vagga</i> either denotes a large division of text, as when used in the compounds Mahāvagga or Cullavagga, or the smallest division of the text, in which case it forms part of the larger division <i translate='no' lang='pli'>kaṇḍa</i>, “a chapter”.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vāra</i>: “a section”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vāra</i> denotes the end of a particular section of the text in the Bhikkhu-pārājikas and the Khandhakas.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vidhi</i>: “a process”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Vidhi</i> is used to denote certain processes used to achieve particular results, such as the ordination process. It is found only in headings and summary verses.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Saṅkhitta</i>: “in brief”, “contracted”</h3>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Saṅkhepa</i>: “a contraction”</h3>
<p>Used only in the Parivāra.</p>
<h3><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Suddhika</i>: “a basic series”</h3>
<p><i translate='no' lang='pli'>Suddhika</i>, the “basic series”, thus refers to the fundamental template on which the more complicated series are based.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sp 1.200: <i translate='no' lang='pli'>Tesu suddhikavāre paṭhamajjhānaṁ ādiṁ katvā yāva mohā cittaṁ vinīvaraṇapadaṁ, tāva ekamekasmiṁ pade samāpajjiṁ, samāpajjāmi, samāpanno, lābhīmhi, vasīmhi, sacchikataṁ mayāti imesu chasu padesu ekamekaṁ padaṁ tīhākārehi, catūhi, pañcahi, chahi, sattahākārehīti evaṁ pañcakkhattuṁ yojetvā suddhikanayo nāma vutto.</i><br>
“Among them, in the <i translate='no' lang='pli'>suddhika</i> section, having placed the first absorption at the beginning, as far as the phrase ‘a mind free from the hindrance of confusion’, so far each phrase one by one. Having thus connected the fivefold ‘when three conditions are fulfilled, when four, when five, when six, when seven conditions are fulfilled’ phrase by phrase with these six phrases ‘I attained, I’m attaining, I’ve attained, I obtain, I master, I’ve realized’, the method of the ‘basic series’ is spoken of.”</p>
