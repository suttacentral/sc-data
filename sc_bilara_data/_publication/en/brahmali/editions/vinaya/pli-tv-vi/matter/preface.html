<h1>Preface to Vinaya</h1>
<p class='byline'>Ajahn Brahmali, 25 October 2023</p>
<p>Voila! Welcome to the first absolutely complete translation into English of the Vinaya Piṭaka, the Monastic Law! It has been over ten years in the making, with the actual beginnings of the process no more than a hazy memory. When I started out, I had no clear sense that this would ever get published, and so it is especially satisfying to have reached this point.</p>
<p>The purpose of this translation has been to produce an accurate, clear, and accessible rendering of the Monastic Law into English. I have tried, throughout, to have the true users of the Vinaya in mind, that is, the monastics who live their lives according to these scriptures. To this end, I have attempted to make the text both meaningful and easy to read, with the objective of producing an easy-to-use guide that can readily be applied to one’s monastic life. I have endeavored to find a balance between formality and natural spoken language. My aim has been to give the reader a sense that the most important parts of the Vinaya consists of real teachings, often spoken by the Buddha himself.</p>
<p>A secondary purpose has been to improve on I. B. Horner’s incomplete and at times inaccurate translation. Despite her admirable and careful work as a pioneer, Horner’s translation suffers from a number of shortcomings. Especially problematic is her failure to translate the more risqué parts of the Vinaya, of which there are quite a few. It so happens, unfortunately, that these parts can be of critical importance to a monastic trying to understand the details of their training rules. Further, Horner’s translation is often inaccurate, and occasionally outright wrong. At times it is impossible to understand her renderings, giving the impression that she did not properly grasp the meaning of the underlying Pali. I have tried to avoid such issues by always translating clearly, even in case where the meaning was in doubt. In my view, it is better to translate meaningfully, even if sometimes wrongly, than to leave the reader bewildered. At least a text with a clear meaning can be duly criticized.</p>
<p>This first edition is complete as far as the translation is concerned, but it is still lacking in detailed introductions, indices, and other aids to the reader. The footnotes regularly refer to an Appendix of Technical Terms, which unfortunately is not ready for this edition. All this ancillary material will be added over the course of the next year or two, when I will also add a proper acknowledgments page. For now, I will just say that I have been the recipient of much kindness and generosity from many people, without whose help this work might never have got published. A special thanks is nevertheless due to Ajahn Brahm who has taught me Vinaya over several decades, continuing into the present day! His pragmatic approach to the Vinaya, combined with his clarity on details and his ability to see the big picture, is in a class of its own. More immediately, I have received careful and indefatigable help from Tracy Lau, now an Anagarika at Dhammasara Monastery. It is a great blessing to have such dedicated and intelligent support. Last but not least, I need to mention my good friend and sometimes mentor, Bhante Sujato, who is ultimately responsible for this whole project. It is truly astonishing what he has been able to achieve as an extended result of his work on SuttaCentral.</p>
<p>The Vinaya Piṭaka is a specialist’s corner of the Pali Canonical texts, and the readership will inevitably be limited. In fact, the Vinaya is really a kind of support literature, with the suttas being at the core of the Buddhist tradition. Never mind, I shall rest content with the tiniest of readership. At least one person has already benefitted. May you enjoy it too!</p>
