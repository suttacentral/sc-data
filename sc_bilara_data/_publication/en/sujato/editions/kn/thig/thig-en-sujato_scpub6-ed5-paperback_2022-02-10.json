Celebrating the bliss of freedom and the life of meditation, the verses are full of proud and joyous proclamations of the nuns’ spiritual attainments and their gratitude to other nuns as guides and teachers. The Therīgāthā is one of the oldest spiritual texts anywhere that records primarily women’s voices. It is a pair with the Theragāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Monks”.",
