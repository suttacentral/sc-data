    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
    <p>I remember with gratitude all those from whom I have learned the Dhamma, especially Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Bodhi, the two monks who more than anyone else showed me the depth, meaning, and practical value of the Suttas.</p>
    <p>Special thanks to Dustin and Keiko Cheah and family, who sponsored my stay in Qi Mei while I made this translation.</p>
    <p>Thanks also for Blake Walshe, who provided essential software support for my translation work.</p>
    <p>Finally my everlasting thanks to all those people, far too many to mention, who have supported SuttaCentral, and those who have supported my life as a monastic. None of this would be possible without you.</p>
