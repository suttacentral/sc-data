<h1>Preface to <em>Middle Discourses</em></h1>
<p>It was in 1992 that I first encountered the Buddha’s words. I was in Chieng Mai, having just completed my very first meditation retreat, a month-long <em>vipassanā</em> intensive in the Mahasi style. During the retreat, the guides at Wat Ram Poeng told us not to read any books, but to learn only from our own experience. This was an entirely novel concept for me at the time. The retreat, quite frankly, blew my mind.</p>
<p>When the retreat was over reading was allowed, and as a confirmed  bookworm from childhood, I couldn’t wait to start making sense of all that had happened on my retreat. They gave me some of the then-available books, collections of Dhamma talks and the like. They were fine, but nothing that really sparked my enthusiasm. </p>
<p>I went back and said, “They talk about these things called ‘the Suttas’. What are they?”</p>
<p>This was the days before the internet and before the excellent editions by Bhikkhu Bodhi. What they had was the selected discourses from the Majjhima Nikāya translated by Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi, edited and compiled by Bhikkhu Khantipalo as <cite class='book'>A Treasury of the Buddha’s Words</cite>. Very excited, I took the first volume back to my room and began to read.</p>
<p>Right away I knew. There was something about it. It was not at all what I was expecting. I don’t know what I was expecting, but this wasn’t it. It was so different than my usual reading. At once transparent and obscure; forbidding and intimate. The Buddha’s voice was refreshingly free of the apologetics and mysticism I associated with “spiritual” literature. He was direct, blunt even. He spoke with the quiet authority of someone who actually knew what he was talking about.</p>
<p>I took it slow, reading a Sutta per day. There was much that I didn’t understand, even with the notes and introductions. But I knew that there were great depths there. This was the Buddha! This would be just the start of a long journey. So I read, slowly, going back over it again and again, digesting as much as I could. When I had the time, I’d read an hour a day and meditate a few hours. The teachers at Wat Ram Poeng told us to sit mindfully when learning Dhamma, so I did. I brought as much care and mindful attention to reading as I did to meditation.</p>
<p>Gradually I made my way through the Majjhima Nikāya, learning volumes along the way. I remember some months after that retreat I was staying in Mae Hong Son, at a farm for orphaned children called Buddhakaset. I was there as a volunteer for a while. When the kids had gone to bed, I’d sit in the evening under the shelter of a simple wooden verandah. I’d carefully open my book of Suttas and read the next one, never quite knowing what was to come. There are many things that most Buddhists will encounter and know through Buddhist culture, then rediscover when reading the Suttas. “Ahh, that’s where that came from!” For me it was the opposite: I discovered things in the Suttas, then noticed them in Buddhist culture.</p>
<p>I continued these practices through my early years as a monk. Gradually, I read my way through the Suttas, often in the archaic translations that were then available. But I kept the simple approach I had from the start. Read a bit, meditate a lot. Things that I read then have stayed with me until the present.</p>
<p>I reread the Majjhima Nikāya in other translations. First that by I.B. Horner for the Pali Text Society, which was roughly contemporary to that of Ñāṇamoḷi, but which in publication and language seemed of an earlier generation. Then Bhikkhu Bodhi’s edition came out, a completely revised and seemingly perfected translation based on that of Ñāṇamoḷi. Exciting times! I was beginning my Pali studies, but I never expected to one day be making my own translation.</p>
<p>I hope that you might experience something of the joy and inspiration that I found in my discovery of the Suttas. At this point, having been a monk for twenty-five years, it is redundant to say that these teachings changed my life. They might change yours, too, if you let them.</p>
