  "dhp335:1": "When one is overcome by that which is despicable - ",
  "dhp335:2": "craving, which keeps us stuck in the world - ",
  "dhp335:3": "then sorrow grows in them, ",

  "dhp336:1": "When one overcomes that which is despicable - ",
  "dhp336:2": "craving, which is so hard to transcend in this world - ",
  "dhp336:3": "then sorrow falls away from them, ",
  "dhp336:4": "like drops of water from a lotus. ",
  "dhp337:1": "I wish the best to all of you ",
  "dhp337:2": "that are gathered here - ",
  "dhp337:3": "dig up the root of craving, ",

  "dhp337:5": "do not let Māra subdue you again and again, ",
  "dhp337:6": "like a stream does to reeds. ",
  "dhp338:1": "As long as its root is undisturbed and strong, ",
  "dhp338:2": "a felled tree grows again. ",
  "dhp338:3": "In the same way, as long as the tendency towards craving is not destroyed, ",
  "dhp338:4": "it produces suffering again and again. ",
  "dhp339:1": "If the 36 streams ",
  "dhp339:2": "are flowing strongly towards what one likes, ",
  "dhp339:3": "then one is swept along by harmful views ",

  "dhp350:1": "One who approves of tranquil thought, ",
  "dhp350:2": "who has cultivated awareness of non-beauty and is always mindful, ",
  "dhp350:3": "will put an end to that craving ",
