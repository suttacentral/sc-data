  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.7.11": "This, brahmin, was my second breaking out, like a chick from an eggshell. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.1": "Then, with my mind stilled, purified, cleansed, flawless, free from defilements, supple, wieldy, steady, and unshakable, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the corruptions. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.2": "I knew according to reality: ‘This is suffering;’ ‘This is the origin of suffering;’ ‘This is the end of suffering;’ ‘This is the path leading to the end of suffering.’ ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.3": "I knew according to reality: ‘These are the corruptions;’ ‘This is the origin of the corruptions;’ ‘This is the end of the corruptions;’ ‘This is the path leading to the end of the corruptions.’ ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.8.4": "When I knew and saw this, my mind was freed from the corruption of sensual desire, from the corruption of desire to exist, from the corruption of views, and from the corruption of delusion. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.4": "Just as one might set upright what’s overturned, or reveal what’s hidden, or show the way to one who’s lost, or bring a lamp into the dark so that one with eyes might see what’s there—",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.5": "just so have you made the Teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.6": "Good Gotama, I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.8": "And please consent to spend the rainy-season residence at Verañjā together with the Sangha of monks.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.9": "The Buddha consented by keeping silent, and the brahmin understood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:1.9.10": "He then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.1": "At that time Verañjā was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. It was not easy to get by on almsfood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.2": "Just then some horse dealers from Uttarāpatha had entered the rainy-season residence at Verañjā with five hundred horses. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.3": "In the horse pen they prepared portion upon portion of steamed grain for the monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.4": "Then, after robing up in the morning, the monks took their bowls and robes and entered Verañjā for alms. Not getting anything, they went to the horse pen. They then brought back many portions of steamed grain to the monastery, where they pounded and ate them. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.5": "Venerable Ānanda crushed a portion on a stone, took it to the Buddha, and the Buddha ate it. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.6": "And the Buddha heard the sound of the mortar. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.7": "When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.8": "They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.9": "Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.10": "for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.11": "Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.12": "And so the he said to Ānanda, “Ānanda, what’s this sound of a mortar?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.13": "Ānanda told him what was happening. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.14": "“Well done, Ānanda. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.1.15": "You’re all superior people who have conquered the problems of famine. Later generations will despise even meat and rice.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.1": "Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.2": "“At present, Venerable Sir, Verañjā is short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.3": "It’s not easy to get by on almsfood. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.4": "But the undersurface of this great earth abounds with food, tasting just like pure honey. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.5": "Would it be good, Sir, if I inverted the earth so that the monks may enjoy the nutrition in those sprouts?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.6": "“But what will you do, Moggallāna, with the creatures that live there?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.7": "“I’ll transform one hand to be like the great earth and make those creatures go there. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:2.2.12": "“Let it be, Moggallāna, don’t pursue this.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.1": "Soon afterwards, while reflecting in private, Venerable Sāriputta thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.2": "“Which Buddhas had a long-lasting spiritual life, and which not?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.4": "In the evening, after coming out of seclusion, Sāriputta went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.5": "“Just now, Sir, while I was reflecting in private, I was wondering which Buddhas had a long-lasting spiritual life, and which not?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.1.7": "“Sāriputta, the spiritual life established by the Buddhas Vipassī, Sikhī, and Vessabhū didn’t last long. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.2": "“They made no effort to give detailed teachings to their disciples. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.4": "Nor did they lay down training rules or recite a monastic code. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.5": "After the disappearance of those Buddhas and the disciples awakened under them, those who were the last disciples—of various names, families, and castes, who had gone forth from various households—allowed that spiritual life to disappear rapidly. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.6": "It’s like flowers on a wooden plank. If they’re not held together with a string, they’re scattered about, whirled about, and destroyed by the wind. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.8": "Because they’re not held together with a string. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.10": "Instead they were untiring at instructing their disciples by reading their minds. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:3.2.11": "At one time, Sāriputta, the Buddha Vessabhū, the Perfected and the fully Awakened One, was staying in a certain frightening forest grove. He instructed a sangha of a thousand monks by reading their minds, saying, ",
