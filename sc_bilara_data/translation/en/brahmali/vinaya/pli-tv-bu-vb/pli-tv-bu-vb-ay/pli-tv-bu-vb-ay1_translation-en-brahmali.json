  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.0": "Origin story ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.2": "At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.3": "On one occasion one of the families that supported him gave their daughter in marriage to the son of another family. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.4": "Soon afterwards Venerable Udāyī robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went to the first of those families. When he arrived, he asked ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.5": "where the daughter was, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.6": "and he was told ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.7": "that she had been given to another family. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.8": "That family too supported Udāyī. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.9": "He then went there and again asked ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.10": "where the girl was. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.11": "They said, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.12": "“She’s sitting in her room.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.13": "He went up to that girl, and the two of them sat down alone on a private and concealed seat suitable for action. When they were able, they chatted; otherwise he gave her a teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.14": "At that time Visākhā Migāramātā had many healthy children and grandchildren. As a consequence, she was considered auspicious. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.15": "At sacrifices, ceremonies, and celebrations people would feed Visākhā first. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.16": "Just then she had been invited to that family that supported Udāyī. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.17": "When she arrived, she saw him sitting alone with that girl, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.18": "and she said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.19": "“Venerable, it’s not appropriate for you to sit alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for action. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.20": "You may not be aiming at that act, but it’s hard to convince people with little confidence.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.21": "But Udāyī did not listen. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.22": "After leaving, Visākhā told the monks what had happened. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.25": "After rebuking Udāyī in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.26": "“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.27": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.28": "The Buddha rebuked him … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ay1:1.29": "“Foolish man, how could you do this? ",
