  "pli-tv-kd1:1.1.1": "At one time, soon after his awakening, the Buddha was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of a Bodhi tree. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:1.1.2": "There the Buddha sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:1.2.1": "Then, in the first part of the night, the Buddha reflected on dependent origination in forward and reverse order: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:1.2.2": "“Ignorance is a condition for intentional activities; intentional activities are a condition for consciousness; consciousness is a condition for name and form; name and form are a condition for the six sense spheres; the six sense spheres are a condition for contact; contact is a condition for feeling; feeling is a condition for craving; craving is a condition for grasping; grasping is a condition for existence; existence is a condition for birth; birth is a condition for old age and death, for grief, sorrow, pain, aversion, and distress to come to be.

  "pli-tv-kd1:2.2.1": "Then a conceited brahmin approached the Buddha, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:2.2.2": "exchanged pleasantries with him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:2.2.4": "and said, ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:2.3.1": "Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:2.3.2": "“The brahmin who has shut out bad qualities, ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:3.1.1": "After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the goat-herd’s banyan tree to a powder-puff tree. There too he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving, experiencing the bliss of freedom. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.2.1": "Just then an unseasonal storm was approaching, with seven days of rain, cold winds, and clouds. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.2.2": "Mucalinda, the dragon king, came out from his abode. And he encircled the body of the Buddha with seven coils and spread his large hood over his head, thinking, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.2.3": "“May the Buddha not be hot or cold, nor be touched by horseflies or mosquitoes, by the wind or the burning sun, or by creeping animals and insects.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.3.1": "After seven days, when he knew the sky was clear, Mucalinda unraveled his coils from the Buddha’s body and transformed himself into a young brahmin. He then stood in front of the Buddha, venerating him with joined palms raised. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.3.2": "Seeing the significance of this, the Buddha exclaimed an inspired utterance: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.4.1": "“Seclusion is bliss for the contented one, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:3.4.2": "For the one who sees the Truth that he has heard. ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.1": "Just then the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika were traveling from Ukkala to that area. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.2": "Then a god who was a former relative of theirs said to them, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.3": "“Sirs, a Buddha who has just attained awakening is staying at the foot of an ape-flower tree. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.4": "Go to that Buddha and offer him baked goods and honey. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.2.5": "That will be for your benefit and happiness for a long time.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.3.1": "And they took baked goods and honey and approached the Buddha. They bowed down ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.3.2": "and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.3.3": "“Venerable Sir, please accept the baked goods and honey from us. That will be to our benefit and happiness for a long time.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.1": "The Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.2": "“Buddhas don’t receive with their hands. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.3": "In what should I receive the baked goods and honey?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.4": "Then, reading the mind of the Buddha, the four great kings offered him four stone bowls from the four directions, saying, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.5": "“Here, Sir, please receive the baked goods and honey in these.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.4.6": "After receiving the baked goods and honey in one of the valuable stone bowls, the Buddha ate them. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.1": "When Tapussa and Bhallika knew that the Buddha had finished his meal, they bowed down with their head at his feet, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.2": "“Sir, we take refuge in the Buddha and the Teaching. Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.3": "By means of the double refuge, they became the first lay followers in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:4.5.4": "The story at the ape-flower tree is finished. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.1.0": "5. The account of the supreme being’s request ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.1.1": "After seven days, the Buddha came out from that stillness and went from the ape-flower tree to a goat-herd’s banyan tree, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.1.2": "and he stayed there. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.1": "Then, while in seclusion, the Buddha thought this: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.2": "“I have discovered this profound truth, so hard to see, so hard to comprehend. It’s peaceful and sublime, subtle, beyond the intellect, and knowable only to the wise. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.3": "But human beings delight in holding on, find pleasure in holding on, rejoice in holding on, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.4": "and because of that it’s hard for them to see causal relationships, dependent origination. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.5": "This too is very hard for them to see: the stilling of all intentional activities, the giving up of all ownership, the stopping of craving, fading away, ending, extinguishment. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.2.6": "If I were to teach this truth, others would not understand, and that would be wearying and troublesome for me.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.1": "And spontaneously, these verses never heard before occurred to the Buddha: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.2": "“What I’ve discovered with difficulty, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.3": "There’s no point in making it known. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.4": "For those overcome by sensual desire and ill will, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.5": "This truth is hard to understand. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.6": "Those who are excited by sensual desire, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.7": "Obstructed by a mass of darkness, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.8": "Won’t see what goes against the stream, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.3.9": "What’s subtle and refined, profound and hard to see.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.4.1": "When the Buddha reflected like this, he inclined to inactivity, and not to teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.4.2": "Just then the supreme being Sahampati read the mind of the Buddha. And he thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.4.3": "“The world is lost; it’s perished!—for the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened, inclines to inaction, and not to teaching.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.5.1": "Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch out his arm, so Sahampati disappeared from the world of supreme beings and appeared in front of the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.6.1": "He put his upper robe over one shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, raise his joined palms, and said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.6.2": "“Please teach, Venerable Sir, please teach! ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.6.3": "There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are ruined because of not hearing the Teaching. There will be those who understand.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.1": "This is what Sahampati said, and he added: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.2": "“Earlier, among the Magadhans, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.3": "An impure teaching appeared, conceived by defiled people. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.4": "Open this door to the deathless! ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.5": "Let them hear the Truth, discovered by the Pure One. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.6": "Just as one standing on a rocky mountain top ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.7": "Would see the people all around, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.8": "Just so, All-seeing Wise One, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.9": "Ascend the temple of the Truth. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.10": "Being rid of sorrow, look upon the people, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.11": "Sunk in grief, overcome by birth and old age. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.12": "Stand up, Victorious Hero! ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.13": "Debtless One, Leader of travelers, go walking in the world. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.14": "Sir, proclaim the Teaching; ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.7.15": "There will be those who understand.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.1": "Twice the Buddha repeated to Sahampati what he had thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.4": "But human beings delight in holding on, find pleasure in holding on, rejoice in holding on, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.5": "and because of that it’s hard for them to see causal relationships, dependent origination. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.8.6": "This too is very hard for them to see: the stilling of all intentional activities, the giving up of all ownership, the stopping of craving, fading away, ending, extinguishment. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.9.1": "and on both occasions Sahampati repeated his request. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.9.53": "There will be those who understand.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.10.1": "The Buddha understood the request of that supreme being, and because he had compassion for the world, he surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.11.1": "He saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with sharp faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, those easy to teach and those difficult to teach, and he even saw some who regarded the next world as dangerous and to be avoided. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.11.2": "It was just like a lotus pond with lotuses born and grown in water: some remain submerged in the water without rising out of it, others reach the surface of the water, and others still rise out of the water without being touched by it. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.1": "When he had seen this, the Buddha replied to Sahampati in verse: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.2": "“Open to them are the doors to the deathless; ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.3": "May those who hear give rise to faith. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.4": "Seeing trouble, supreme being, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.12.5": "I did not speak the sublime and subtle Truth.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.13.1": "Sahampati thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.13.2": "“The Buddha has consented to teach.” He bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and disappeared right there. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:5.13.3": "The account of the supreme being’s request is finished. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.0": "6. The account of the group of five ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.1": "The Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.2": "“Who should I teach first? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.3": "Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.4": "And it occurred to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.5": "“Ālāra Kālāma is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.1.6": "Perhaps I should teach him first. He will understand this Teaching quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.1": "But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Ālāra Kālāma died seven days ago,” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.2": "and the Buddha also knew this for himself. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.3": "He thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.4": "“Ālāra Kālāma’s loss is great, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.2.5": "for if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.1": "Again the Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.2": "“Who should I teach first? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.3": "Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.4": "And it occurred to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.5": "“Udaka Rāmaputta is wise and competent, and has for a long time had little dust in his eyes. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.3.6": "Perhaps I should teach him first. He will understand this Teaching quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.1": "But an invisible god informed the Buddha, “Sir, Udaka Rāmaputta died last night,” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.2": "and the Buddha also knew this for himself. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.3": "He thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.4": "“Udaka Rāmaputta’s loss is great, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.4.5": "for if he had heard this Teaching he would have understood it quickly.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.1": "Once again the Buddha thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.2": "“Who should I teach first? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.3": "Who will understand this Teaching quickly?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.4": "And it occurred to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.5.5": "“The group of five monks who supported me while I was striving were of great service to me. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.6.1": "Perhaps I should teach them first. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.6.3": "But where are they staying now?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.6.4": "And with superhuman and purified clairvoyance, the Buddha saw that the group of five monks were staying near Benares, in the dear park at Isipatana. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.6.5": "Then, after staying at Uruvelā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Benares. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.1": "The Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw the Buddha traveling between Gayā and the place of awakening. And he said to the Buddha, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.2": "“Sir, your faculties are clear and your skin is pure and bright. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.3": "Who have you gone forth under? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.4": "Who is your teacher ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.7.5": "or whose teaching do you follow?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.1": "The Buddha replied to Upaka in verse: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.2": "“Overcoming all, I know all. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.3": "Abandoning all, I’m not soiled by anything. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.4": "Through my own insight, I’m freed by the ending of craving—",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.5": "So who should I refer to as a teacher? ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.6": "I have no teacher; ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.7": "No-one like me exists. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.8": "In the world with its gods, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.9": "I have no equal. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.10": "For I’m a Perfected One, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.11": "A teacher supreme. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.12": "I alone am fully awakened; ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.13": "I am cool and extinguished. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.14": "I’m going to the city of Kāsi, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.15": "To set rolling the wheel of the Teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.16": "In this world immersed in darkness, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.8.17": "I’ll beat the drum of the deathless.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.9.1": "“According to your own claim you must be a universal conqueror.” ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:6.9.6": "Saying, “May it be so,” Upaka shook his head, chose the wrong road, and left. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.1": "The Buddha continued wandering toward the deer park at Isipatana near Benares. When he eventually arrived, he approached to the group of five monks. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.2": "Seeing him coming, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.3": "the group of five made an agreement with one another: ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.4": "“Here comes the ascetic Gotama, who has has given up his striving and returned to a life of abundance. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.10.5": "We shouldn’t bow down to him, stand up for him, or receive his bowl and robe, ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:6.11.2": "One went to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, another prepared a seat, another set out water for washing the feet, yet another set out a foot-stool, and the last one put out a foot-scraper. ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:6.11.5": "But they still addressed him by name and as “friend”. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.12.1": "The Buddha said to the group of five monks, ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:6.13.2": "“Friend Gotama, by practicing extreme austerities you didn’t gain any superhuman quality, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of noble ones. Since you have given up your striving and returned to a life of abundance, how could you now have achieved any of this?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.14.1": "The Buddha said, ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.14.2": "“I haven’t given up striving and returned to a life of abundance,” ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.14.3": "and he repeated what he had said before. ",
  "pli-tv-kd1:6.15.1": "A second time the group of five monks repeated their question ",

  "pli-tv-kd1:6.15.3": "A third time they repeated their question, ",
