  "pli-tv-kd9:1.1.5": "At this time a number of monks who were wandering in Kāsī arrived at Vāsabha. ",
  "pli-tv-kd9:1.1.6": "When Kassapagotta saw those monks coming, he prepared seats, and he set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He then went out to meet them, received their bowls and robes, and asked if they wanted water to drink. He made sure they had a bath, and he helped them get congee, fresh foods, and meals. ",

  "pli-tv-kd9:1.4.2": "When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-kd9:1.4.3": "Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, ",
  "pli-tv-kd9:1.4.4": "the Buddha said to Kassapagotta, ",
