  "pli-tv-kd17:1.4.2": "After going a good distance, they turned back the army. They then entered a foreign territory, removed their ornaments, bound them in a bundle with an upper robe, and said to Upāli, ",

  "pli-tv-kd17:1.5.13": "Saying, “Yes, Sir,” he did just that. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.1": "Bhaddiya consented. He then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.2": "And the Buddha said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.3": "“Is it true, Bhaddiya, that when you’re in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently utter a heartfelt exclamation: ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.4": "‘Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!’?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.5": "“Yes, Venerable Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.6": "“But why do you say this?” ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.8": "“In the past, when I was a king, I was well protected within and outside the royal compound, within and outside of town, and within and outside of the country. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.9": "But although I was protected and guarded in this way, I was fearful, agitated, and distrustful. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.10": "But now, Sir, when I’m in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I’m free from fear, agitation, and distrust. I’m free from bother, relaxed, living on what’s given by others, with a mind as free as a wild animal. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.11": "This is why I say this.” ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.13": "Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.14": "“They who have no anger within, ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.15": "Gone beyond any kind of existence, ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:1.6.16": "Happy, free from fear and sorrow—",

  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.3": "he stayed in Ghosita’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.4": "Then, while reflecting in private, Devadatta thought, ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.5": "“Who might I inspire to have confidence in me, so that I’d get much gain and honor?” ",

  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.21": "By means of this wonder Devadatta was able to inspire Ajātasattu to have confidence in him. Ajātasattu then attended on him morning and evening, with five hundred carriages and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of food. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.22": "Overcome by gain, honor, and fame, ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.23": "Devadatta started desiring to lead the Sangha of monks. ",
  "pli-tv-kd17:2.1.24": "But with the appearance of that thought, his supernormal powers disappeared. ",
