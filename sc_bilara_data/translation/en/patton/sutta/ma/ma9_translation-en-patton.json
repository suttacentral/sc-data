  "ma9:31.10": "How can I know?’” ",
  "ma9:32.1": "He answered, ",
  "ma9:32.2": "“Good man, if the Bhagavān, the ascetic Gautama, declared that nirvāṇa without remainder because the precepts are purified, then he would be saying [something with] a remainder has no remainder. ",

  "ma9:33.1": "“Good man, if the Bhagavān declared that nirvāṇa without remainder was to part with these things, then ordinary people would [enter] parinirvāṇa because they part with these things, too. ",
  "ma9:34.1": "“Good man, it’s simply because the precepts are purified that the mind can be purified … ",
  "ma9:34.2": "because the mind is purified that views can be purified … ",

  "ma9:35.1": "“Permit me to continue, good man. ",
  "ma9:35.2": "Once, the king of Kośala Prasenajit was in Śrāvastī and had some business in Śāketa. ",

  "ma9:45.1": "“Thus, good man, did the king of Kośala Prasenajit answer that crowd of ministers’ questions. ",
  "ma9:45.2": "Thus, good man, it’s because the precepts are purified that the mind can be purified … ",
