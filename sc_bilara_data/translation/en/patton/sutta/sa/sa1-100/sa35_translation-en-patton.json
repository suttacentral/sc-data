  "sa35:2.1": "At the time, there were three upright gentlemen who had left home not long before. ",
  "sa35:2.2": "They were Venerable Aniruddha, Venerable Nandika, and Venerable Kimbila. ",
  "sa35:3.1": "Knowing what they were thinking in their minds, the Bhagavān instructed them: ",
  "sa35:3.2": "“Monks, this mind, this reasoning, this consciousness should contemplate this. ",
  "sa35:3.3": "Don’t contemplate that. ",
  "sa35:3.4": "Stop this desire; stop this form. ",
  "sa35:3.5": "Someone who realizes this abides fully. ",
  "sa35:3.6": "Monks, could there be form that’s permanent, unchanging, and a correct abode?” ",
