  "mil4.6:1.2": "\"These ten, your majesty, are the special qualities of a lay follower. ",
  "mil4.6:1.3": "What are the ten? Here, your majesty, a lay follower shares the same happiness and suffering as the Saṅgha does; he has the Dhamma as his authority; he delights in sharing according to his ability; when seeing the decline of the Conqueror's dispensation, he strives for its growth. ",
  "mil4.6:1.4": "He is of right view; he is free from taking delight in auspicious festivals; even for the sake of his livelihood he does not take another teacher as supreme; his bodily and verbal conduct is guarded; he delights in harmony and is devoted to harmony; he is not envious; nor does he conduct himself in the dispensation through hypocrisy; he has gone to the Buddha for refuge; he has gone to the Dhamma for refuge; and he has gone to the Saṅgha for refuge. ",
  "mil4.6:1.5": "These, your majesty, are the ten special qualities of a lay follower. All these qualities are found in you. It is fitting, proper, suitable, and appropriate for you that, seeing the decline of the Conqueror's dispensation, you desire its growth. I give you permission; ask me as you please.\" ",
