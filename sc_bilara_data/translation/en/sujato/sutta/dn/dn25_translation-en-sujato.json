  "dn25:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "dn25:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "dn25:1.3": "Now at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was residing in the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers, together with a large assembly of three thousand wanderers. ",
  "dn25:1.4": "Then the householder Sandhāna left Rājagaha in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. ",
  "dn25:1.5": "Then it occurred to him, ",
  "dn25:1.6": "“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, ",
  "dn25:1.7": "as he’s in retreat. ",
  "dn25:1.8": "And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, ",
  "dn25:1.9": "as they’re in retreat. ",
  "dn25:1.10": "Why don’t I visit the wanderer Nigrodha at the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers?” ",
  "dn25:1.11": "So he went to the monastery of the wanderers. ",
  "dn25:2.1": "Now at that time, Nigrodha was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as ",
  "dn25:2.2": "talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. ",
  "dn25:3.1": "Nigrodha saw Sandhāna coming off in the distance, ",
  "dn25:3.2": "and hushed his own assembly: ",
  "dn25:3.3": "“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. ",
  "dn25:3.4": "The householder Sandhāna, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming. ",
  "dn25:3.5": "He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Rājagaha. ",
  "dn25:3.6": "Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. ",
  "dn25:3.7": "Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” ",
  "dn25:3.8": "Then those wanderers fell silent. ",
  "dn25:4.1": "Then Sandhāna went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "dn25:4.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Nigrodha, ",
  "dn25:4.3": "“The way the wanderers make an uproar as they sit together and talk about all kinds of low topics is one thing. ",
  "dn25:4.4": "",
  "dn25:4.5": "It’s quite different to the way the Buddha frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.” ",
  "dn25:5.1": "When Sandhāna said this, Nigrodha said to him, ",
  "dn25:5.2": "“Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom? ",
  "dn25:5.3": "Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion. ",
  "dn25:5.4": "He just lurks on the periphery. ",
  "dn25:5.5": "He’s just like the nilgai antelope, circling around and lurking on the periphery. ",
  "dn25:5.6": "",
  "dn25:5.7": "",
  "dn25:5.8": "",
  "dn25:5.9": "",
  "dn25:5.10": "Please, householder, let the ascetic Gotama come to this assembly. I’ll sink him with just one question! I’ll roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow pot!” ",
  "dn25:6.1": "With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the householder Sandhāna and the wanderer Nigrodha. ",
  "dn25:6.2": "Then the Buddha descended Vulture’s Peak Mountain and went to the peacocks’ feeding ground on the bank of the Sumāgadhā, where he walked mindfully in the open air. ",
  "dn25:6.3": "Nigrodha saw him, ",
  "dn25:6.4": "and hushed his own assembly: ",
  "dn25:6.5": "“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. The ascetic Gotama is walking mindfully on the bank of the Sumāgadhā. ",
  "dn25:6.6": "The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet. ",
  "dn25:6.7": "Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach. ",
  "dn25:6.8": "If he comes, I’ll ask him this question: ",
  "dn25:6.9": "‘Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?’” ",
  "dn25:6.10": "Then those wanderers fell silent. ",
  "dn25:7.0": "2. Mortification in Disgust of Sin ",
  "dn25:7.1": "Then the Buddha went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, ",
  "dn25:7.2": "who said to him, ",
  "dn25:7.3": "“Come, Blessed One! Welcome, Blessed One! ",
  "dn25:7.4": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. ",
  "dn25:7.5": "Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” ",
  "dn25:7.6": "The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, ",
  "dn25:7.7": "while Nigrodha took a low seat and sat to one side. ",
  "dn25:7.8": "The Buddha said to him, ",
  "dn25:7.9": "“Nigrodha, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” ",
  "dn25:7.10": "Nigrodha said, ",
  "dn25:7.11": "“Well, sir, I saw you walking mindfully and said: ",
  "dn25:7.12": "‘If the ascetic Gotama comes, I’ll ask him this question: ",
  "dn25:7.13": "“Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?”’ ",
  "dn25:7.14": "This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” ",
  "dn25:7.15": "“It’s hard for you to understand this, Nigrodha, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition. ",
  "dn25:7.16": "Please ask me a question about the higher mortification in disgust of sin in your own tradition: ",
  "dn25:7.17": "‘How are the conditions for the mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?’” ",
  "dn25:7.18": "When he said this, those wanderers made an uproar, ",
  "dn25:7.19": "“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic Gotama has such power and might! For he sets aside his own doctrine and invites discussion on the doctrine of others!” ",
  "dn25:8.1": "Then Nigrodha, having quieted those wanderers, said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn25:8.2": "“Sir, we teach mortification in disgust of sin, regarding it as essential and clinging to it. ",
  "dn25:8.3": "How are the conditions for the mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?” ",
  "dn25:8.4": "“It’s when a mortifier goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal. ",
  "dn25:8.5": "They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. ",
  "dn25:8.6": "They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. ",
  "dn25:8.7": "They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals. ",
  "dn25:8.8": "They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. ",
  "dn25:8.9": "They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. ",
  "dn25:8.10": "They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice. ",
  "dn25:8.11": "They constantly stand, refusing seats. ",
  "dn25:8.12": "They squat, committed to persisting in the squatting position. ",
  "dn25:8.13": "They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. ",

  "dn25:8.16": "They wear dust and dirt. ",
  "dn25:8.17": "They stay in the open air. ",

  "dn25:8.21": "They’re committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening. ",
  "dn25:8.22": "What do you think, Nigrodha? ",
  "dn25:8.23": "If this is so, is the mortification in disgust of sin complete, or incomplete?” ",
  "dn25:8.24": "“Clearly, sir, if that is so the mortification in disgust of sin is complete, not incomplete.” ",
