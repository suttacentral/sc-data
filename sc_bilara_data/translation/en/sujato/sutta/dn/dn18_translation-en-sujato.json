  "dn18:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house. ",
  "dn18:1.3": "Now at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all over the nations; the Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjis and Mallas, Cetīs and Vacchas, Kurus and Pañcālas, Macchas and Sūrasenas: ",
  "dn18:1.4": "“This one was reborn here, while that one was reborn there. ",
  "dn18:1.5": "Over fifty devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. ",
  "dn18:1.6": "More than ninety devotees in Ñātika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. ",

  "dn18:4.3": "You’d think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees who have passed away! ",

  "dn18:5.1": "After pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private, Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his concerns, finishing by saying, ",

  "dn18:13.19": "“The heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle!” ",
  "dn18:14.1": "Then the gods of the thirty-three, having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Clear Right, advised and instructed the four great kings on the subject. ",
  "dn18:14.2": "Each one, having been advised, stood at his own seat without leaving. ",

  "dn18:15.7": "a light vast and great. ",
  "dn18:16.0": "5. On Sanaṅkumāra ",
  "dn18:16.1": "Then the gods of the thirty-three sat in their own seats, saying, ",
  "dn18:16.2": "“We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.” ",

  "dn18:17.8": "“Now the divinity Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses.” ",
  "dn18:17.9": "And the god on whose couch the Divinity sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness, ",
  "dn18:18.1": "like a king on the day of his coronation. ",
  "dn18:18.2": "",
  "dn18:18.3": "Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra manifested a solid incarnation, taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha, and appeared to the gods of the thirty-three. ",
  "dn18:18.4": "Rising into the air, he sat cross-legged in the sky, ",
  "dn18:18.5": "like a strong man might sit cross-legged on a well-appointed couch or on level ground. ",
  "dn18:18.6": "Seeing the joy of those gods, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses: ",

  "dn18:19.1": "That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke. ",
  "dn18:19.2": "And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had eight qualities: it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant. ",
  "dn18:19.3": "He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but the sound doesn’t extend outside the assembly. ",
  "dn18:19.4": "When someone has a voice like this, they’re said to have the voice of the Divinity. ",
  "dn18:20.1": "Then the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, having manifested thirty-three life-forms, sat down on the couches of each of the gods of the thirty-three and addressed them, ",

When their bodies break up, after death, some are reborn in the company of the gods who control what is created by others, some with the gods who love to create, some with the joyful gods, some with the gods of Yama, some with the gods of the thirty-three, and some with the gods of the four great kings.
