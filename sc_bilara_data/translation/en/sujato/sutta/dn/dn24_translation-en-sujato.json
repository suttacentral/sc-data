  "dn24:1.1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Anupiya. ",
  "dn24:1.1.3": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Anupiya for alms. ",
  "dn24:1.1.4": "Then it occurred to him, ",
  "dn24:1.1.5": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Anupiya. ",
  "dn24:1.1.6": "Why don’t I go to visit the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan in his monastery?” ",
  "dn24:1.2.1": "So that’s what he did. ",
  "dn24:1.2.2": "Then the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn24:1.2.3": "“Let the Blessed One come, sir! ",
  "dn24:1.2.4": "Welcome to the Blessed One, sir! ",
  "dn24:1.2.5": "It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. ",
  "dn24:1.2.6": "Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” ",
  "dn24:1.2.7": "The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, ",
  "dn24:1.2.8": "while the wanderer of the Bhaggava clan took a low seat, sat to one side, ",
  "dn24:1.2.9": "and said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn24:1.2.10": "“Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said: ",
  "dn24:1.2.11": "‘Now, Bhaggava, I have disavowed the Buddha. ",

  "dn24:1.3.1": "A few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: ",
  "dn24:1.3.2": "‘Now I disavow the Buddha! ",
  "dn24:1.3.3": "Now I shall no longer live dedicated to you.’ ",
  "dn24:1.3.4": "When Sunakkhatta said this, I said to him, ",

  "dn24:1.6.8": "“The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individual persons.

  "dn24:1.6.9": "",
  "dn24:1.6.10": "I declare this to you, Sunakkhatta, I announce this to you! ",
  "dn24:1.6.11": "There will be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama. That’s why he resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. ",
  "dn24:1.6.12": "That’s what they’ll say.’ ",
  "dn24:1.6.13": "Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell. ",
  "dn24:1.7.0": "2. On the Aristocrat of Kuru ",
  "dn24:1.7.1": "Bhaggava, this one time I was staying in the land of the Kurus where they have a town named Uttarakā. ",
  "dn24:1.7.2": "Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Uttarakā for alms with Sunakkhatta the Licchavi as my second monk. ",
  "dn24:1.7.3": "Now at that time a naked ascetic who was an aristocrat of Kuru had taken a vow to behave like a dog. When food is tossed on the ground, he gets down on all fours, eating and devouring it just with his mouth. ",
  "dn24:1.7.4": "Sunakkhatta saw him doing this ",
  "dn24:1.7.5": "and thought, ",
  "dn24:1.7.6": "‘That ascetic is a holy man!’ ",
  "dn24:1.7.7": "Then, knowing Sunakkhatta’s train of thought, I said to him, ",
  "dn24:1.7.8": "‘Don’t you claim to be an ascetic who follows the Sakyan, you silly man?’ ",
  "dn24:1.7.9": "‘But why does the Buddha say this to me?’ ",
  "dn24:1.7.10": "",
  "dn24:1.7.11": "‘When you saw that naked ascetic of Kuru, didn’t you think, ",
  "dn24:1.7.12": "“That ascetic is a holy man!”?’ ",
  "dn24:1.7.13": "‘Yes, sir. ",
  "dn24:1.7.14": "But sir, are you jealous of the perfected ones?’ ",
  "dn24:1.7.15": "‘I’m not jealous of the perfected ones, you silly man. ",
  "dn24:1.7.16": "Rather, you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you. ",
  "dn24:1.7.17": "Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself! ",
  "dn24:1.7.18": "That naked ascetic the aristocrat of Kuru, who you imagine to be a holy man, will die of flatulence in seven days. ",
  "dn24:1.7.19": "And when he dies, he’ll be reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas. ",
  "dn24:1.7.20": "And they’ll throw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver. ",
  "dn24:1.7.21": "If you wish, Sunakkhatta, go to the aristocrat of Kuru and ask him ",
  "dn24:1.7.22": "whether he knows his own destiny. ",
  "dn24:1.7.23": "It’s possible that he will answer: ",
  "dn24:1.7.24": "“Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own destiny. ",
  "dn24:1.7.25": "I’ve been reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas.”’ ",
  "dn24:1.8.1": "So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see the aristocrat of Kuru and said to him, ",
  "dn24:1.8.2": "‘Reverend aristocrat of Kuru, the ascetic Gotama has declared ",
  "dn24:1.8.3": "that you will die of flatulence in seven days. ",
  "dn24:1.8.4": "And when you die, you’ll be reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas. ",
  "dn24:1.8.5": "And when you die, they’ll throw you in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver. ",
  "dn24:1.8.6": "But by eating just a little food and drinking just a little water, ",
  "dn24:1.8.7": "you’ll prove what the ascetic Gotama says to be false.’ ",
  "dn24:1.8.8": "Then Sunakkhatta counted up the days until the seventh day, as happens when you have no faith in the Realized One. ",
  "dn24:1.8.9": "But on the seventh day, the naked ascetic who was an aristocrat of Kuru died of flatulence. ",
  "dn24:1.8.10": "And when he passed away, he was reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas. ",
  "dn24:1.8.11": "And when he passed away, they threw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver. ",
  "dn24:1.9.1": "Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this. ",
  "dn24:1.9.2": "",
  "dn24:1.9.3": "So he went to see the aristocrat of Kuru in the charnel ground on the clump of vetiver. There he struck him with his fist three times, ",
  "dn24:1.9.4": "‘Reverend aristocrat of Kuru, do you know your destiny?’ ",
  "dn24:1.9.5": "Then the aristocrat of Kuru got up, rubbing his back with his hands, and said, ",
  "dn24:1.9.6": "‘Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own destiny. ",
  "dn24:1.9.7": "I’ve been reborn in the very lowest rank of titans, named the Kālakañjas.’ After speaking, he fell flat right there. ",
  "dn24:1.10.1": "Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him, ",
  "dn24:1.10.2": "‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? ",
  "dn24:1.10.3": "Did the prediction I made about the aristocrat of Kuru turn out to be correct, or not?’ ",
  "dn24:1.10.4": "‘It turned out to be correct.’ ",
  "dn24:1.10.5": "‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? ",
  "dn24:1.10.6": "If that is so, has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?’ ",
  "dn24:1.10.7": "‘Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed.’ ",
  "dn24:1.10.8": "‘Though I performed such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this: ",
  "dn24:1.10.9": "“But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.” ",
  "dn24:1.10.10": "See how far you have strayed!’ ",
  "dn24:1.10.11": "Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell. ",
  "dn24:1.11.0": "3. On the Naked Ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka ",
  "dn24:1.11.1": "This one time, Bhaggava, I was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. ",
  "dn24:1.11.2": "Now at that time the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka was residing in Vesālī. And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material things and fame. ",
  "dn24:1.11.3": "He had undertaken these seven vows. ",
  "dn24:1.11.4": "‘As long as I live, I will be a naked ascetic, not wearing clothes. As long as I live, I will be chaste, not having sex. As long as I live, I will consume only meat and beer, not eating rice and porridge. ",
  "dn24:1.11.5": "And I will not go past the following shrines near Vesālī: the Udena Shrine to the east, the Gotamaka to the south, the Seven Maidens to the west, and the Many Sons to the north.’ ",
  "dn24:1.11.6": "And it was due to undertaking these seven vows that he had reached the peak of material things and fame. ",
  "dn24:1.12.1": "So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and asked him a question. ",
  "dn24:1.12.2": "But when it stumped him, ",
  "dn24:1.12.3": "he displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness. ",
  "dn24:1.12.4": "So Sunakkhatta thought, ",
  "dn24:1.12.5": "‘I’ve offended the holy man, the perfected one, the ascetic. ",
  "dn24:1.12.6": "I mustn’t create lasting harm and suffering for myself!’ ",
  "dn24:1.13.1": "Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him, ",
  "dn24:1.13.2": "‘Don’t you claim to be an ascetic who follows the Sakyan, you silly man?’ ",
  "dn24:1.13.3": "‘But why does the Buddha say this to me?’ ",

  "dn24:1.13.16": "That naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka, who you imagine to be a true holy man, ",
  "dn24:1.13.17": "will shortly be clothed, living with a partner, eating rice and porridge, having gone past all the shrines near Vesālī. And he will die after losing all his fame.’ ",
  "dn24:1.13.18": "And that’s exactly what happened. ",
  "dn24:1.14.1": "Sunakkhatta heard about this. ",
