  "dn28:1.3": "Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: ",
  "dn28:1.4": "“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” ",
  "dn28:1.5": "“That’s a grand and bold statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: ",

  "dn28:1.7": "I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’ ",
  "dn28:1.8": "What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you encompassed their minds to know that ",

  "dn28:1.19": "",
  "dn28:2.1": "“Sir, though I don’t encompass the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present, ",
  "dn28:2.2": "still I understand this by inference from the teaching. ",
  "dn28:2.3": "Suppose there were a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. ",
  "dn28:2.4": "And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. ",

  "dn28:2.8": "In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: ",
  "dn28:2.9": "‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they awaken to the supreme perfect awakening.’ ",

They understand how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds. ",

  "dn28:18.6": "It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right application of mind—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they wield the many kinds of psychic power: ",
  "dn28:18.7": "multiplying themselves and becoming one again; materializing and dematerializing; going unobstructed through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the realm of divinity.
