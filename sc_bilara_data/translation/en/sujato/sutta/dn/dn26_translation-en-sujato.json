  "dn26:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Mātulā. ",
  "dn26:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "dn26:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "dn26:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "dn26:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "dn26:1.7": "“Mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. ",
  "dn26:1.8": "And how does a mendicant do this? ",
  "dn26:1.9": "They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. ",
  "dn26:1.10": "They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … ",
  "dn26:1.11": "mind … ",
  "dn26:1.12": "principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. ",
  "dn26:1.13": "That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. ",
  "dn26:1.14": "You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. ",
  "dn26:1.15": "If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t catch you or get hold of you. ",
  "dn26:1.16": "It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that merit grows. ",
  "dn26:2.0": "2. King Daḷhanemi ",
  "dn26:2.1": "Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures. ",
  "dn26:2.2": "He had the following seven treasures: ",
  "dn26:2.3": "the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. ",
  "dn26:2.4": "He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. ",
  "dn26:2.5": "After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword. ",
  "dn26:3.1": "Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his men, ",
  "dn26:3.2": "‘My good man, when you see that the heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place, please tell me.’ ",
  "dn26:3.3": "‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. ",
  "dn26:3.4": "After many thousand years had passed, that man saw that the heavenly wheel-treasure had receded back from its place. So he went to King Daḷhanemi and said, ",
  "dn26:3.5": "‘Please sire, you should know that your heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.’ ",
  "dn26:3.6": "So the king summoned the crown prince and said, ",
  "dn26:3.7": "‘Dear prince, my heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place. ",
  "dn26:3.8": "I’ve heard that ",
  "dn26:3.9": "when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he does not have long to live. ",
  "dn26:3.10": "I have enjoyed human pleasures. Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasures. ",
  "dn26:3.11": "Come, dear prince, rule this land surrounded by ocean! ",
  "dn26:3.12": "I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’ ",
  "dn26:3.13": "And so, after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "dn26:3.14": "Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished. ",
  "dn26:4.1": "Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said, ",
  "dn26:4.2": "‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ ",
  "dn26:4.3": "At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. ",
  "dn26:4.4": "He went to the royal sage and said, ",
  "dn26:4.5": "‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ ",
  "dn26:4.6": "When he said this, the royal sage said to him, ",
  "dn26:4.7": "‘Don’t be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheel-treasure. My dear, the wheel-treasure is not inherited from your father. ",
  "dn26:4.8": "Come now, my dear, proceed in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:4.9": "If you do so, it’s possible that—on a fifteenth day sabbath, having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath—the heavenly wheel-treasure will appear to you, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.’ ",
  "dn26:5.0": "2.1. The Noble Duty of a Wheel-Turning Monarch ",
  "dn26:5.1": "‘But sire, what is the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch?’ ",
  "dn26:5.2": "‘Well then, my dear, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as your flag, banner, and authority—provide just protection and security for your court, troops, aristocrats, vassals, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds. ",
  "dn26:5.3": "Do not let injustice prevail in the realm. ",
  "dn26:5.4": "Provide money to the penniless in the realm. ",
  "dn26:5.5": "And there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves. From time to time you should go up to them and ask and learn: ",
  "dn26:5.6": "“Sirs, what is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?” ",
  "dn26:5.7": "Having heard them, you should reject what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillful. ",
  "dn26:5.8": "This is the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch.’ ",
  "dn26:5.9.0": "2.2. The Wheel-Treasure Appears ",
  "dn26:5.10": "‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the new king to the royal sage. And he proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:5.11": "While he was proceeding in that duty, on a fifteenth day sabbath, he had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath. ",
  "dn26:5.12": "And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail. ",
  "dn26:5.13": "Seeing this, the king thought, ",
  "dn26:5.14": "‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:5.15": "Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’ ",
  "dn26:6.1": "Then the anointed king, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying, ",
  "dn26:6.2": "‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’ ",
  "dn26:6.3": "Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. ",
  "dn26:6.4": "And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, ",
  "dn26:6.5": "‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ ",
  "dn26:6.6": "The wheel-turning monarch said, ",
  "dn26:6.7": "‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ ",
  "dn26:6.8": "And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals. ",
  "dn26:7.1": "Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. … ",
  "dn26:7.2": "Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. … ",

  "dn26:7.10": "In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. ",
  "dn26:7.11": "And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, ",
  "dn26:7.12": "‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ ",
  "dn26:7.13": "The wheel-turning monarch said, ",
  "dn26:7.14": "‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ ",
  "dn26:7.15": "And so the rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals. ",
  "dn26:7.16": "And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returned to the royal capital. There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound. ",

  "dn26:8.6": "and a seventh time, a wheel-turning monarch was established in exactly the same way. And after many years the seventh wheel-turning monarch went forth, handing the realm over to the crown prince. ",

  "dn26:9.3": "At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. ",
  "dn26:9.4": "But he didn’t go to the royal sage and ask about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:9.5": "He just governed the country according to his own ideas. ",
  "dn26:9.6": "So governed, the country’s people did not prosper like before, as they had when former kings proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:9.7": "Then the ministers and counselors, the treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and professional advisers gathered and said to the king, ",
  "dn26:9.8": "‘Sire, when governed according to your own ideas, the country’s people do not prosper like before, as they did when former kings proceeded in the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:9.9": "In your realm are found ministers and counselors, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and professional advisers—both ourselves and others—who remember the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:9.10": "Please, Your Majesty, ask us about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:9.11": "We will answer you.’ ",
  "dn26:10.0": "4. On the Period of Decline ",
  "dn26:10.1": "So the anointed king asked the assembled ministers and counselors, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and professional advisers about the noble duty of a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "dn26:10.2": "And they answered him. ",
  "dn26:10.3": "After listening to them, he provided just protection and security. But he did not provide money to the penniless in the realm. ",
  "dn26:10.4": "And so poverty grew widespread. ",
  "dn26:10.5": "When poverty was widespread, a certain person stole from others, with the intention to commit theft. ",
  "dn26:10.6": "They arrested him ",
  "dn26:10.7": "and presented him to the king, saying, ",
  "dn26:10.8": "‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others with the intention to commit theft.’ ",
  "dn26:10.9": "The king said to that person, ",
  "dn26:10.10": "‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others with the intention to commit theft?’ ",
  "dn26:10.11": "‘It’s true, sire.’ ",
  "dn26:10.12": "‘What was the reason?’ ",
  "dn26:10.13": "‘Sire, I can’t survive.’ ",

  "dn26:12.15": "‘If I provide money to anyone who steals from others, it will only increase the stealing. ",
  "dn26:12.16": "I’d better make an end of this person, finish him off, and chop off his head.’ ",
  "dn26:12.17": "Then he ordered his men, ",
  "dn26:12.18": "‘Well then, my men, tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and make an end of him, finish him off, and chop off his head.’ ",
  "dn26:12.19": "‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ they replied, and did as he commanded. ",

  "dn26:13.3": "It occurred to them, ",
  "dn26:13.4": "‘We’d better have sharp swords made. Then when we steal from others, we’ll make an end of them, finish them off, and chop off their heads.’ ",
  "dn26:13.5": "They had sharp swords made. Then they started to make raids on villages, towns, and cities, and to infest the highways. ",
  "dn26:13.6": "And they chopped the heads off anyone they stole from. ",
  "dn26:14.1": "And so, mendicants, from not providing money to the penniless, poverty became widespread. When poverty was widespread, theft became widespread. When theft was widespread, swords became widespread. When swords were widespread, killing living creatures became widespread.
