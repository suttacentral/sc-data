  "dn23:1.4": "Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi was living in Setavyā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. ",

  "dn23:2.1": "Now at that time Pāyāsi had the following harmful misconception: ",
