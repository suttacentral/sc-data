  "dn16:1.1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "dn16:1.1.3": "Now at that time King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, wanted to invade the Vajjis. ",
  "dn16:1.1.4": "He declared: ",
  "dn16:1.1.5": "“I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!” ",
  "dn16:1.2.1": "And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of Magadha, ",
  "dn16:1.2.2": "“Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",
  "dn16:1.2.4": "And then say: ",

  "dn16:1.2.8": "Remember well how the Buddha answers and tell it to me. ",
  "dn16:1.2.9": "For Realized Ones say nothing that is not so.” ",
  "dn16:1.3.0": "1. The Brahmin Vassakāra ",
  "dn16:1.3.1": "“Yes, worthy sir,” Vassakāra replied. He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Rājagaha for the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "dn16:1.3.2": "He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "dn16:1.3.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn16:1.3.4": "“Worthy Gotama, King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",

  "dn16:1.4.0": "2. Principles That Prevent Decline ",
  "dn16:1.4.1": "Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him. ",
  "dn16:1.4.2": "Then the Buddha said to him, ",
  "dn16:1.4.3": "“Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?” ",

  "dn16:1.4.9": "Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed?” ",
  "dn16:1.4.10": "“I have heard that, sir.” ",
  "dn16:1.4.11": "“As long as the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the ancient Vajjian traditions as they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline. ",
  "dn16:1.4.12": "Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?” ",
  "dn16:1.4.13": "“I have heard that, sir.” ",
  "dn16:1.4.14": "“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline. ",
  "dn16:1.4.15": "Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them?” ",
  "dn16:1.4.16": "“I have heard that, sir.” ",
  "dn16:1.4.17": "“As long as the Vajjis don’t forcibly abduct the women or girls of the clans and make them live with them, they can expect growth, not decline. ",
  "dn16:1.4.18": "Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?” ",
  "dn16:1.4.19": "“I have heard that, sir.” ",
  "dn16:1.4.20": "“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect growth, not decline. ",
  "dn16:1.4.21": "Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?” ",
  "dn16:1.4.22": "“I have heard that, sir.” ",
  "dn16:1.4.23": "“As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not decline.” ",
  "dn16:1.5.1": "Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra, ",
  "dn16:1.5.2": "“Brahmin, this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada Shrine. ",
  "dn16:1.5.3": "There I taught the Vajjis these seven principles that prevent decline. ",
  "dn16:1.5.4": "As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.” ",
  "dn16:1.5.5": "When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him, ",
  "dn16:1.5.6": "“Worthy Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth, not decline. ",
  "dn16:1.5.7": "How much more so all seven! ",
  "dn16:1.5.8": "King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by bribery or by sowing dissension. ",
  "dn16:1.5.9": "Well, now, worthy Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” ",
  "dn16:1.5.10": "“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.” ",
  "dn16:1.5.11": "Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left. ",
  "dn16:1.6.0": "3. Principles That Prevent Decline Among the Mendicants ",
  "dn16:1.6.1": "Soon after he had left, the Buddha said to Ānanda, ",
  "dn16:1.6.2": "“Go, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Rājagaha together in the assembly hall.” ",
  "dn16:1.6.3": "“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked. Then he went back, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, ",
  "dn16:1.6.4": "“Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience.” ",
  "dn16:1.6.5": "Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out ",
  "dn16:1.6.6": "and addressed the mendicants: ",
  "dn16:1.6.7": "“Mendicants, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent decline. ",

Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they awaken to the supreme perfect awakening.’” ",

  "dn16:4.25.7": "Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!” ",
  "dn16:4.25.8": "So the Buddha drank the water. ",

  "dn16:4.26.1": "Now at that time Pukkusa the Malla, a disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma, was traveling along the road from Kusinārā to Pāvā. ",
  "dn16:4.26.2": "He saw the Buddha sitting at the root of a certain tree. ",
  "dn16:4.26.3": "He went up to him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said, ",
  "dn16:4.26.4": "“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations. ",
  "dn16:4.27.1": "Once it so happened that Āḷāra Kālāma, while traveling along a road, left the road and sat at the root of a nearby tree for the day’s meditation. ",
  "dn16:4.27.2": "Then around five hundred carts passed by right beside Āḷāra Kālāma. ",
  "dn16:4.27.3": "Then a certain person coming behind those carts went up to Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him: ",
  "dn16:4.27.4": "‘Sir, didn’t you see the five hundred carts pass by?’ ",
  "dn16:4.27.5": "‘No, friend, I didn’t see them.’ ",
  "dn16:4.27.6": "‘But sir, didn’t you hear a sound?’ ",
  "dn16:4.27.7": "‘No, friend, I didn’t hear a sound.’ ",
  "dn16:4.27.8": "‘But sir, were you asleep?’ ",

  "dn16:4.27.14": "‘Yes, friend.’ ",
  "dn16:4.27.15": "Then that person thought: ",
  "dn16:4.27.16": "‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, ",
  "dn16:4.27.17": "in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to him.’ ",
  "dn16:4.27.18": "And after declaring his lofty confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left.” ",
  "dn16:4.28.1": "“What do you think, Pukkusa? ",
  "dn16:4.28.2": "Which is harder and more challenging to do while conscious and awake: ",
  "dn16:4.28.3": "to neither see nor hear a sound as five hundred carts pass by right next to you? ",
  "dn16:4.28.4": "Or to neither see nor hear a sound as the heavens are raining and pouring, lightning’s flashing, and thunder’s cracking?” ",
  "dn16:4.29.1": "“What do five hundred carts matter, or six hundred, or seven hundred, or eight hundred, or nine hundred, or a thousand, or even a hundred thousand carts? ",
  "dn16:4.29.2": "It’s far harder and more challenging to neither see nor hear a sound as the heavens are raining and pouring, lightning’s flashing, and thunder’s cracking!” ",
  "dn16:4.30.1": "“This one time, Pukkusa, I was staying near Ātumā in a threshing-hut. ",
  "dn16:4.30.2": "At that time the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And not far from the threshing-hut two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen. ",
  "dn16:4.30.3": "Then a large crowd came from Ātumā to the place where that happened. ",
  "dn16:4.31.1": "Now at that time I came out of the threshing-hut and was walking mindfully in the open near the door of the hut. ",
  "dn16:4.31.2": "Then having left that crowd, a certain person approached me, bowed, and stood to one side. I said to them, ",
  "dn16:4.32.1": "‘Why, friend, has this crowd gathered?’ ",
  "dn16:4.32.2": "‘Just now, sir, the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen. ",
  "dn16:4.32.3": "Then this crowd gathered here. ",
  "dn16:4.32.4": "But sir, where were you?’ ",
  "dn16:4.32.5": "‘I was right here, friend.’ ",
  "dn16:4.32.6": "‘But sir, did you see?’ ",
  "dn16:4.32.7": "‘No, friend, I didn’t see anything.’ ",
  "dn16:4.32.8": "‘But sir, didn’t you hear a sound?’ ",

  "dn16:4.32.13": "‘Yes, friend.’ ",
  "dn16:4.32.14": "‘So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking?’ ",
  "dn16:4.32.15": "‘Yes, friend.’ ",
  "dn16:4.33.1": "Then that person thought: ",
  "dn16:4.33.2": "‘Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, ",
  "dn16:4.33.3": "in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as the heavens were raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking.’ ",
  "dn16:4.33.4": "And after declaring their lofty confidence in me, they bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on their right, before leaving.” ",
  "dn16:4.34.1": "When he said this, Pukkusa said to him, ",
  "dn16:4.34.2": "“Any confidence I had in Āḷāra Kālāma I whisk away as in a strong wind, or glide away as down a swift stream. ",
  "dn16:4.34.3": "Excellent, sir! Excellent! ",
  "dn16:4.34.4": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "dn16:4.34.5": "I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "dn16:4.34.6": "From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” ",
  "dn16:4.35.1": "Then Pukkusa addressed a certain man, ",
  "dn16:4.35.2": "“Please, my man, fetch a pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold.” ",
  "dn16:4.35.3": "“Yes, sir,” replied that man, and did as he was asked. ",
  "dn16:4.35.4": "Then Pukkusa brought the garments to the Buddha, ",
  "dn16:4.35.5": "“Sir, please accept this pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold from me out of sympathy.” ",
  "dn16:4.35.6": "“Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one, and Ānanda in the other.” ",
  "dn16:4.35.7": "“Yes, sir,” replied Pukkusa, and did so. ",
  "dn16:4.36.1": "Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Pukkusa the Malla with a Dhamma talk, ",
  "dn16:4.36.2": "after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. ",
  "dn16:4.37.1": "Then, not long after Pukkusa had left, Ānanda placed the pair of garments the color of mountain gold by the Buddha’s body. ",
  "dn16:4.37.2": "But when placed by the Buddha’s body they seemed to lose their shine. ",
  "dn16:4.37.3": "Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn16:4.37.4": "“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how pure and bright is the color of the Realized One’s skin. ",
  "dn16:4.37.5": "When this pair of ready to wear garments the color of mountain gold is placed by the Buddha’s body they seem to lose their sheen.” ",
  "dn16:4.37.6": "“That’s so true, Ānanda, that’s so true! There are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright. ",
  "dn16:4.38.1": "What two? ",
  "dn16:4.38.2": "The night when a Realized One awakens to the supreme perfect awakening; and the night he becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue. ",
  "dn16:4.38.3": "These are the are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright. ",
  "dn16:4.38.4": "Today, Ānanda, in the last watch of the night, between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā, shall be the Realized One’s full extinguishment. ",
  "dn16:4.38.5": "Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Kakudhā River.” ",
  "dn16:4.38.6": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "dn16:4.38.7": "A pair of garments the color of mountain gold ",
  "dn16:4.38.8": "was presented by Pukkusa; ",
  "dn16:4.38.9": "when the teacher was clothed with them, ",
  "dn16:4.38.10": "his snow gold skin glowed bright. ",
  "dn16:4.39.1": "Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakudhā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank. And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove, ",
  "dn16:4.39.2": "where he addressed Venerable Cundaka, ",
  "dn16:4.39.3": "“Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.” ",
  "dn16:4.40.1": "“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked. ",
  "dn16:4.40.2": "And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. ",
  "dn16:4.40.3": "But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:4.41.1": "Having gone to Kakudhā Creek, ",
  "dn16:4.41.2": "whose water was transparent, sweet, and clear, ",
  "dn16:4.41.3": "the Teacher, being tired, plunged in, ",
  "dn16:4.41.4": "the Realized One, without compare in the world. ",
  "dn16:4.41.5": "And after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged. ",
  "dn16:4.41.6": "Before the group of mendicants, in the middle, <j>the Buddha, ",
  "dn16:4.41.7": "the Teacher <j>who rolled forth the present dispensation, ",
  "dn16:4.41.8": "the great seer went to the mango grove. ",
  "dn16:4.41.9": "He addressed the mendicant named Cundaka: ",
  "dn16:4.41.10": "“Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down.” ",
  "dn16:4.41.11": "The evolved one urged Cunda, ",
  "dn16:4.41.12": "who quickly spread the folded robe. ",
  "dn16:4.41.13": "The Teacher lay down so tired, ",
  "dn16:4.41.14": "while Cunda sat there before him. ",
  "dn16:4.42.1": "Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda: ",
  "dn16:4.42.2": "“Now it may happen, Ānanda, that someone may give rise to regret in Cunda the smith: ",
  "dn16:4.42.3": "‘It’s your loss, respected Cunda, it’s your misfortune, in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last almsmeal from you.’ ",
  "dn16:4.42.4": "You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like this: ",
  "dn16:4.42.5": "‘You’re fortunate, respected Cunda, you’re so very fortunate, ",
  "dn16:4.42.6": "in that the Realized One was fully quenched after eating his last almsmeal from you. ",
  "dn16:4.42.7": "I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha. ",
  "dn16:4.42.8": "There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings. ",
  "dn16:4.42.9": "What two? ",
  "dn16:4.42.10": "The almsmeal after eating which a Realized One awakens to the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with no residue. ",
  "dn16:4.42.11": "These two almsmeal offerings have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings. ",
  "dn16:4.42.12": "You’ve accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness, fame, heaven, and sovereignty.’ ",
  "dn16:4.42.13": "That’s how you should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith.” ",
  "dn16:4.43.1": "Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: ",
  "dn16:4.43.2": "“A giver’s merit grows; ",
  "dn16:4.43.3": "enmity doesn’t build up when you have self-control. ",
  "dn16:4.43.4": "A skillful person gives up bad things—",

  "dn16:5.1.0": "26. The Pair of Sal Trees ",
  "dn16:5.1.1": "Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, ",
  "dn16:5.1.2": "“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the far shore of the Golden River, and on to the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā.” ",
  "dn16:5.1.3": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "dn16:5.1.4": "And that’s where they went. Then the Buddha addressed Ānanda, ",
  "dn16:5.1.5": "“Please, Ānanda, set up a cot for me between the twin sal trees, with my head to the north. I am tired and will lie down.” ",
  "dn16:5.1.6": "“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked. ",
  "dn16:5.1.7": "And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. ",
  "dn16:5.2.1": "Now at that time the twin sal trees were in full blossom with flowers out of season. ",
  "dn16:5.2.2": "They sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. ",
  "dn16:5.2.3": "And the flowers of the heavenly Flame Tree fell from the sky, and they too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. ",
  "dn16:5.2.4": "And heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky, and it too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. ",

  "dn16:5.2.6": "And heavenly choirs sang in midair in honor of the Realized One. ",
  "dn16:5.3.1": "Then the Buddha pointed out to Ānanda what was happening, adding: ",
  "dn16:5.3.8": "“That’s not the full extent of how the Realized One is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. ",
  "dn16:5.3.9": "Any monk or nun or male or female lay follower who practices in line with the teaching, practicing properly, living in line with the teaching—they honor, respect, revere, venerate, and esteem the Realized One with the highest honor. ",

  "dn16:5.4.1": "Now at that time Venerable Upavāna was standing in front of the Buddha fanning him. ",

  "dn16:5.4.8": "What is the cause, what is the reason for this?” ",

  "dn16:5.6.2": "“There are, Ānanda, deities—both in space and on the earth—who are aware of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamenting: ",
  "dn16:5.6.3": "‘Too soon the Blessed One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of the World will vanish!’ ",

  "dn16:5.8.8": "Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, and think: ",

  "dn16:5.10.4": "There are astute aristocrats, brahmins, and householders who are devoted to the Realized One. They will perform the rites for venerating the Realized One’s corpse.” ",

  "dn16:5.11.4": "“They wrap a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse with unworn cloth, then with uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth. ",
  "dn16:5.11.5": "In this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron casket filled with oil and close it up with another casket. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they cremate the corpse. ",

  "dn16:5.13.2": "“Oh! I’m still only a trainee with work left to do; and my Teacher is about to be fully extinguished, he who is so kind to me!” ",
  "dn16:5.13.3": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, ",

  "dn16:5.14.1": "“Yes, reverend,” Ānanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: ",
  "dn16:5.14.2": "“Enough, Ānanda! Do not grieve, do not lament. Did I not prepare for this when I explained that ",

  "dn16:5.14.6": "You have done good deeds, Ānanda. Devote yourself to meditation, and you will soon be free of defilements.” ",
  "dn16:5.15.1": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: ",

  "dn16:5.17.8": "“Don’t say that Ānanda! Don’t say that ",
  "dn16:5.17.9": "this is a little hamlet, a jungle hamlet, a branch hamlet. ",
  "dn16:5.18.1": "Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures. ",
  "dn16:5.18.2": "His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time was named Kusāvatī. ",
  "dn16:5.18.3": "It stretched for twelve leagues from east to west, and seven leagues from north to south. ",
  "dn16:5.18.4": "The royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food. ",
  "dn16:5.18.5": "It was just like Āḷakamandā, the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous, populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food. ",
  "dn16:5.18.7": "Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night, namely: ",
  "dn16:5.18.8": "the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums, arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry: ‘Eat, drink, be merry!’ as the tenth. ",
  "dn16:5.19.1": "Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas: ",
  "dn16:5.19.2": "‘This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished. ",

  "dn16:5.19.6": "“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Then he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion. ",
  "dn16:5.20.0": "33. The Mallas Pay Homage ",
  "dn16:5.20.1": "Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the town hall on some business. ",
  "dn16:5.20.2": "Ānanda went up to them, and announced: ",
  "dn16:5.20.3": "“This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will be fully extinguished. ",

  "dn16:5.21.1": "When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, ",
  "dn16:5.21.2": "“Too soon the Blessed One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One will be fully extinguished! Too soon the Eye of the World will vanish!” ",
  "dn16:5.21.3": "Then the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives, distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached Ānanda. ",
  "dn16:5.22.1": "Then Ānanda thought, ",
  "dn16:5.22.2": "“If I have the Mallas pay homage to the Buddha one by one, they won’t be finished before first light. ",
  "dn16:5.22.3": "I’d better separate them family by family and then have them pay homage, saying: ",
  "dn16:5.22.4": "‘Sir, the Malla named so-and-so with children, wives, retinue, and ministers bows with his head at your feet.’” ",
  "dn16:5.22.5": "And so that’s what he did. ",

  "dn16:5.23.1": "Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda was residing near Kusinārā. ",
  "dn16:5.23.2": "He heard that ",
  "dn16:5.23.3": "on that very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama. ",
  "dn16:5.23.4": "He thought: ",
  "dn16:5.23.5": "“I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said: ",
  "dn16:5.23.6": "‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’ ",
  "dn16:5.23.7": "And this very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama. ",
  "dn16:5.23.8": "This state of uncertainty has come up in me. ",
  "dn16:5.23.9": "I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty.” ",
  "dn16:5.24.1": "Then Subhadda went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana, approached Ānanda, and said to him, ",
  "dn16:5.24.2": "“Worthy Ānanda, I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the tutors of tutors, said: ",
  "dn16:5.24.3": "‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’ ",
  "dn16:5.24.4": "And this very day, in the last watch of the night, will be the full extinguishment of the ascetic Gotama. ",
  "dn16:5.24.5": "This state of uncertainty has come up in me. ",
  "dn16:5.24.6": "I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty. ",
  "dn16:5.24.7": "Worthy Ānanda, please let me see the ascetic Gotama.” ",
  "dn16:5.24.8": "When he had spoken, Ānanda said, ",
  "dn16:5.24.9": "“Enough, Reverend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realized One. He is tired.” ",
  "dn16:5.24.10": "For a second time, ",
  "dn16:5.24.11": "and a third time, Subhadda asked Ānanda, and a third time Ānanda refused. ",
  "dn16:5.25.1": "The Buddha heard that discussion between Ānanda and Subhadda. ",
  "dn16:5.25.2": "He said to Ānanda, ",
  "dn16:5.25.3": "“Enough, Ānanda, don’t obstruct Subhadda; let him see the Realized One. ",
  "dn16:5.25.4": "For whatever he asks me, he will only be looking to understand, not to trouble me. ",
  "dn16:5.25.5": "And he will quickly understand any answer I give to his question.” ",
  "dn16:5.25.6": "So Ānanda said to the wanderer Subhadda, ",
  "dn16:5.25.7": "“Go, Reverend Subhadda, the Buddha is making time for you.” ",
  "dn16:5.26.1": "Then the wanderer Subhadda went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: ",
  "dn16:5.26.2": "“Worthy Gotama, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. ",
  "dn16:5.26.3": "Namely: Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla, Ajita of the hair blanket, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan. ",
  "dn16:5.26.4": "According to their own claims, did all of them have direct knowledge, or none of them, or only some?” ",
  "dn16:5.26.5": "“Enough, Subhadda, let that be. ",
  "dn16:5.26.7": "I shall teach you the Dhamma. ",
  "dn16:5.26.8": "Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "dn16:5.26.9": "“Yes, sir,” Subhadda replied. ",
  "dn16:5.26.10": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "dn16:5.27.1": "“Subhadda, in whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is not found, there is no ascetic found, no second ascetic, no third ascetic, and no fourth ascetic. ",
  "dn16:5.27.2": "In whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found, there is an ascetic found, a second ascetic, a third ascetic, and a fourth ascetic. ",
  "dn16:5.27.3": "In this teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found. Only here is there an ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic. Other sects are empty of ascetics. ",
  "dn16:5.27.4": "Were these mendicants to practice well, the world would not be empty of perfected ones. ",
  "dn16:5.27.5": "I was twenty-nine years of age, Subhadda, ",
  "dn16:5.27.6": "when I went forth to discover what is skillful. ",
  "dn16:5.27.7": "It’s been over fifty years ",
  "dn16:5.27.8": "since I went forth. ",
  "dn16:5.27.9": "Teacher of the references <j>for the systematic teaching: ",
  "dn16:5.27.10": "outside of here there is no ascetic, ",
  "dn16:5.27.11": "no second ascetic, ",
  "dn16:5.27.12": "no third ascetic, ",
  "dn16:5.27.13": "and no fourth ascetic. ",
  "dn16:5.27.14": "Other sects are empty of ascetics. ",
  "dn16:5.27.15": "Were these mendicants to practice well, the world would not be empty of perfected ones.” ",
  "dn16:5.28.1": "When he had spoken, Subhadda said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn16:5.28.2": "“Excellent, sir! Excellent! ",
  "dn16:5.28.3": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "dn16:5.28.4": "I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "dn16:5.28.5": "Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” ",
  "dn16:5.29.1": "“Subhadda, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. ",
  "dn16:5.29.2": "However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.” ",
  "dn16:5.29.3": "“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” ",
  "dn16:5.29.4": "Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, ",
  "dn16:5.29.5": "“Well then, Ānanda, give Subhadda the going forth.” ",
  "dn16:5.29.6": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "dn16:5.30.1": "Then Subhadda said to Ānanda, ",
  "dn16:5.30.2": "“You’re so fortunate, Reverand Ānanda, so very fortunate, ",
  "dn16:5.30.3": "to be anointed here in the Teacher’s presence as his pupil!” ",
  "dn16:5.30.4": "And the wanderer Subhadda received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. ",
  "dn16:5.30.5": "Not long after his ordination, Venerable Subhadda, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "dn16:5.30.6": "He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.” ",
  "dn16:5.30.7": "And Venerable Subhadda became one of the perfected. ",

  "dn16:6.1.0": "35. The Buddha’s Last Words ",
  "dn16:6.1.1": "Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda: ",

  "dn16:6.1.3": "‘The teacher’s dispensation has passed. Now we have no Teacher.’ ",
  "dn16:6.1.4": "But you should not see it like this. ",
  "dn16:6.1.5": "The teaching and training that I have taught and pointed out for you shall be your Teacher after my passing. ",
  "dn16:6.2.1": "After my passing, mendicants ought not address each other as ‘reverend’, as they do today. ",
  "dn16:6.2.2": "A more senior mendicant ought to address a more junior mendicant by name or clan, or by saying ‘reverend’. ",
  "dn16:6.2.3": "A more junior mendicant ought to address a more senior mendicant using ‘sir’ or ‘venerable’. ",
  "dn16:6.3.1": "If it wishes, after my passing the Saṅgha may abolish the lesser and minor training rules. ",
  "dn16:6.4.1": "After my passing, give the divine punishment to the mendicant Channa.” ",
  "dn16:6.4.2": "“But sir, what is the divine punishment?” ",
  "dn16:6.4.3": "“Channa may say what he likes, ",
  "dn16:6.4.4": "but the mendicants should not correct, advise, or instruct him.” ",

  "dn16:6.15.6": "“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.” ",
  "dn16:6.16.1": "Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā was covered knee-deep with the flowers of the Flame Tree, without gaps even on the filth and rubbish heaps. ",
  "dn16:6.16.2": "Then the deities and the Mallas of Kusinārā carried the Buddha’s corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly and human dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they entered the town by the northern gate, carried it through the center of the town, left by the eastern gate, and deposited the corpse there at the Mallian shrine named Coronation. ",
  "dn16:6.17.1": "Then the Mallas said to Ānanda, ",
  "dn16:6.17.2": "“Honorable Ānanda, how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?” ",
  "dn16:6.17.3": "“Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning monarch.” ",
  "dn16:6.17.4": "“But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse?” ",
  "dn16:6.17.5": "“They wrap a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse with unworn cloth, then with uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth. ",
  "dn16:6.17.6": "In this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron casket filled with oil and close it up with another casket. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they cremate the corpse. ",
  "dn16:6.17.7": "They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the crossroads. ",
  "dn16:6.17.8": "That’s how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse. ",
  "dn16:6.17.9": "Proceed in the same way with the Realized One’s corpse. ",
  "dn16:6.17.10": "A monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads. ",
  "dn16:6.17.11": "When someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” ",
  "dn16:6.18.1": "Then the Mallas ordered their men, ",
  "dn16:6.18.2": "“So then, my men, collect uncarded cotton.” ",
  "dn16:6.18.3": "So the Mallas wrapped the Buddha’s corpse, ",
  "dn16:6.18.4": "and placed it in an iron casket filled with oil. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of aromatics, they lifted the corpse on to the pyre. ",

  "dn16:6.19.8": "Some of the mendicants there who were not free of desire, with arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, ",

  "dn16:6.19.11": "“Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?” ",
  "dn16:6.20.1": "Now at that time a monk named Subhadda, who had gone forth when old, was sitting in that assembly. ",
  "dn16:6.20.2": "He said to those mendicants, ",
  "dn16:6.20.3": "“Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. We’re well rid of that Great Ascetic. And we are oppressed: ",
  "dn16:6.20.4": "‘This is allowable for you; this is not allowable for you.’ ",
  "dn16:6.20.5": "Well, now we shall do what we want and not do what we don’t want.” ",

  "dn16:6.21.1": "Now at that time four of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes, said, ",
  "dn16:6.21.2": "“We shall light the Buddha’s funeral pyre.” But they were unable to do so. ",
  "dn16:6.21.3": "The Mallas said to Anuruddha, ",

  "dn16:6.21.11": "“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.” ",
  "dn16:6.22.1": "Then Venerable Mahākassapa arrived at the Mallian shrine named Coronation at Kusinārā and approached the Buddha’s funeral pyre. Arranging his robe over one shoulder and raising his joined palms, he respectfully circled the Buddha three times, keeping him on his right, and bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet. ",
  "dn16:6.22.2": "And the five hundred mendicants did likewise. ",
  "dn16:6.22.3": "And when Mahākassapa and the five hundred mendicants bowed the Buddha’s funeral pyre burst into flames all by itself. ",

  "dn16:6.23.3": "It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found. ",

  "dn16:6.23.6": "And of those five hundred pairs of garments only two were not burnt: the innermost and the outermost. ",
  "dn16:6.23.7": "But when the Buddha’s corpse was consumed the funeral pyre was extinguished by a stream of water that appeared in the sky, ",
  "dn16:6.23.8": "by water dripping from the sal trees, ",
  "dn16:6.23.9": "and by the Mallas’ fragrant water. ",
  "dn16:6.23.10": "Then the Mallas made a cage of spears for the Buddha’s relics in the town hall and surrounded it with a buttress of bows. For seven days they honored, respected, revered, and venerated them with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. ",
