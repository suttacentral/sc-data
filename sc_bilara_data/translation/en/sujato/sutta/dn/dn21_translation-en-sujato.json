  "dn21:1.1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans, where east of Rājagaha there is a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā, north of which, on Mount Vediyaka, is Indra’s hill cave. ",
  "dn21:1.1.3": "Now at that time Sakka, the lord of gods, grew eager to see the Buddha. ",
  "dn21:1.1.4": "He thought, ",
  "dn21:1.1.5": "“Where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” ",
  "dn21:1.1.6": "Seeing that the Buddha was at Indra’s hill cave, ",
  "dn21:1.1.7": "he addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, ",
  "dn21:1.1.8": "“Good sirs, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave. ",
  "dn21:1.1.9": "What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” ",
  "dn21:1.1.10": "“Yes, lord,” replied the gods. ",
  "dn21:1.2.1": "Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha, ",
  "dn21:1.2.2": "“Dear Pañcasikha, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at Indra’s hill cave. ",
  "dn21:1.2.3": "What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” ",
  "dn21:1.2.4": "“Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went as Sakka’s attendant. ",
  "dn21:1.2.5": "Then Sakka went at the head of a retinue consisting of the gods of the Thirty-Three and the centaur Pañcasikha. ",
  "dn21:1.2.6": "As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the heaven of the gods of the Thirty-Three and landed on Mount Vediyaka north of Ambasaṇḍā. ",
  "dn21:1.3.1": "Now at that time a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā, as happens through the glory of the gods. ",
  "dn21:1.3.2": "People in the villages round about, terrified, shocked, and awestruck, said, ",
  "dn21:1.3.3": "“Mount Vediyaka must be on fire today, blazing and burning! ",
  "dn21:1.3.4": "Oh why has such a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā?” ",
  "dn21:1.3.5": "",
  "dn21:1.4.1": "Then Sakka addressed the centaur Pañcasikha, ",
  "dn21:1.4.2": "“My dear Pañcasikha, it is hard for one like me to get near the Realized Ones while they are on retreat practicing absorption, enjoying absorption. ",
  "dn21:1.4.3": "But if you were to charm the Buddha first, then I could go to see him.” ",
  "dn21:1.4.4": "“Yes, lord,” replied the centaur Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went to Indra’s hill cave. When he had drawn near, he stood to one side, thinking, ",
  "dn21:1.4.5": "“This is neither too far nor too near; and he’ll hear my voice.” ",

  "dn21:1.4.7.0": "1. Pañcasikha’s Song ",
  "dn21:1.4.8": "Standing to one side, Pañcasikha played his arched harp, and sang these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love. ",

  "dn21:1.5.2": "I pay homage to your father Timbaru, ",

  "dn21:1.5.7": "so dear are you, Aṅgīrasi, to me—",
  "dn21:1.5.8": "just like the teaching is to all the saints! ",
  "dn21:1.5.9": "Like a cure when you’re struck by fever dire, ",

  "dn21:1.5.11": "come on, Bhaddā, please put out my fire, ",
  "dn21:1.5.12": "quench me like water on a flame. ",

  "dn21:1.5.15": "so cool, full of petals and of pollen—",
  "dn21:1.5.16": "that’s how I would plunge into your breast. ",
  "dn21:1.5.17": "Like elephants bursting bonds in rutting season, ",
  "dn21:1.5.18": "beating off the pricks of lance and pikes—",

  "dn21:1.6.5": "“This one time, sir, when you were first awakened, you were staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. ",
  "dn21:1.6.6": "And at that time I was in love with the lady named Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, ‘Darling Sunshine’, the daughter of the centaur king Timbaru. ",
  "dn21:1.6.7": "But the sister desired another—",
  "dn21:1.6.8": "it was the one named Sikhaṇḍī—Mātali the charioteer’s son—who she loved. ",

  "dn21:1.7.10": "When I finished, Suriyavaccasā said to me, ",
  "dn21:1.7.11": "‘Dear sir, I have not personally seen the Buddha. But I did hear about him when I went to dance for the gods of the Thirty-Three in the Hall of Justice. ",
  "dn21:1.7.12": "Since you extol the Buddha, let us meet up today.’ ",
  "dn21:1.7.13": "And that’s when I met up with that sister. ",
  "dn21:1.7.14": "But we have not met since.” ",
  "dn21:1.8.0": "2. The Approach of Sakka ",
  "dn21:1.8.1": "Then Sakka, lord of gods, thought, ",
  "dn21:1.8.2": "“Pañcasikha is exchanging pleasantries with the Buddha.” ",
  "dn21:1.8.3": "So he addressed Pañcasikha, ",
  "dn21:1.8.4": "“My dear Pañcasikha, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying: ",
  "dn21:1.8.5": "‘Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.’” ",
  "dn21:1.8.6": "“Yes, lord,” replied Pañcasikha. He bowed to the Buddha and said, ",
  "dn21:1.8.7": "“Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.” ",
  "dn21:1.8.8": "“So may Sakka with his ministers and retinue be happy, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha, ",
  "dn21:1.8.9": "“for all want to be happy—whether gods, humans, titans, dragons, centaurs, or any of the other diverse creatures there may be.” ",
  "dn21:1.8.10": "For that is how the Realized Ones salute such illustrious spirits. ",
  "dn21:1.8.11": "And being saluted by the Buddha, Sakka entered Indra’s hill cave, bowed to the Buddha, and stood to one side. ",
  "dn21:1.8.12": "And the gods of the Thirty-Three did likewise, ",
  "dn21:1.8.13": "as did Pañcasikha. ",
  "dn21:1.9.1": "And at that time the uneven places were evened out, the cramped places were opened up, the darkness vanished in the cave and light appeared, as happens through the glory of the gods. ",
  "dn21:1.9.2": "Then the Buddha said to Sakka, ",
  "dn21:1.9.3": "“It’s incredible and amazing that you, the venerable Kosiya, who has so many duties and so much to do, should come here.” ",
  "dn21:1.9.4": "“For a long time I’ve wanted to come and see the Buddha, but I wasn’t able, being prevented by my many duties and responsibilities for the gods of the Thirty-Three. ",
  "dn21:1.9.5": "This one time, sir, the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut. ",
  "dn21:1.9.6": "Then I went to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. ",
  "dn21:1.10.1": "But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in some kind of meditation. And a divine maiden of Great King Vessavaṇa named Bhūjati was attending on the Buddha, standing there paying homage to him with joined palms. ",
  "dn21:1.10.2": "So I said to her, ",
  "dn21:1.10.3": "‘Sister, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying: ",
  "dn21:1.10.4": "“Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”’ ",
  "dn21:1.10.5": "When I said this, she said to me, ",
  "dn21:1.10.6": "‘It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, ",
  "dn21:1.10.7": "as he’s in retreat.’ ",
  "dn21:1.10.8": "‘Well then, sister, please convey my message when the Buddha emerges from that immersion.’ ",
  "dn21:1.10.9": "",
  "dn21:1.10.10": "I hope that sister bowed to you? ",
  "dn21:1.10.11": "Do you remember what she said?” ",
  "dn21:1.10.12": "“She did bow, lord of gods, and I remember what she said. ",
  "dn21:1.10.13": "I also remember that it was the sound of your chariot wheels that pulled me out of that immersion.” ",
  "dn21:1.11.1": "“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the gods who were reborn in the host of the Thirty-Three before me: ",
  "dn21:1.11.2": "‘When a Realized One arises in the world, perfected and fully awakened, the heavenly hosts swell, while the titan hosts dwindle.’ ",
  "dn21:1.11.3": "And I have seen this with my own eyes. ",
  "dn21:1.11.4.0": "2.1. The Story of Gopikā ",
  "dn21:1.11.5": "Right here in Kapilavatthu there was a Sakyan lady named Gopikā who had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled her ethics. ",
  "dn21:1.11.6": "Losing her attachment to femininity, she developed masculinity. When her body broke up, after death, she was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. ",
  "dn21:1.11.7": "In the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three she became one of my sons. ",
  "dn21:1.11.8": "There they knew him as ",
  "dn21:1.11.9": "the god Gopaka. ",
  "dn21:1.11.10": "Meanwhile three others, mendicants who had led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior centaur realm. ",
  "dn21:1.11.11": "There they amused themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and became my servants and attendants. ",
  "dn21:1.11.12": "At that, Gopaka scolded them, ",
  "dn21:1.11.13": "‘Where on earth were you at, good sirs, when you heard the Buddha’s teaching! ",
  "dn21:1.11.14": "For while I was still a woman I had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled my ethics. I lost my attachment to femininity and developed masculinity. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. In the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three I became one of Sakka’s sons. ",
  "dn21:1.11.15": "Here they know me as ",
  "dn21:1.11.16": "the god Gopaka. ",
  "dn21:1.11.17": "But you, having led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior centaur realm. ",
  "dn21:1.11.18": "It is a sad sight indeed to see fellow practitioners reborn in the inferior centaur realm.’ ",
  "dn21:1.11.19": "When scolded by Gopaka, two of those gods regained their memory right away. They went to the host of Brahmā’s Ministers, but one god remained attached to sensual pleasures. ",
  "dn21:1.12.1": "‘“I was a laywoman disciple of the Clear-eyed One, ",
  "dn21:1.12.2": "and my name was Gopikā. ",
  "dn21:1.12.3": "I was devoted to the Buddha and the teaching, ",
  "dn21:1.12.4": "and I faithfully served the Saṅgha. ",
  "dn21:1.12.5": "Because of the excellence of the Buddha’s teaching, ",
  "dn21:1.12.6": "I’m now a mighty, splendid son of Sakka, ",
  "dn21:1.12.7": "reborn among the Three and Thirty. ",
  "dn21:1.12.8": "And here they know me as Gopaka. ",
  "dn21:1.12.9": "Then I saw some mendicants who I’d seen before, ",
  "dn21:1.12.10": "dwelling in the host of centaurs. ",
  "dn21:1.12.11": "When I used to be a human, ",
  "dn21:1.12.12": "they were disciples of Gotama. ",
  "dn21:1.12.13": "I served them with food and drink, ",
  "dn21:1.12.14": "and clasped their feet in my own home. ",
  "dn21:1.12.15": "Where on earth were these good sirs at ",
  "dn21:1.12.16": "when they learned the Buddha’s teachings? ",
  "dn21:1.12.17": "For each must know for themselves the teaching ",
  "dn21:1.12.18": "so well-taught, realized by the Clear-eyed One. ",
  "dn21:1.12.19": "I was one who followed you, ",
  "dn21:1.12.20": "having heard the fine words of the noble ones. ",
  "dn21:1.12.21": "I’m now a mighty, splendid son of Sakka, ",
  "dn21:1.12.22": "reborn among the Three and Thirty. ",
  "dn21:1.12.23": "But you followed the best of men, ",
  "dn21:1.12.24": "and led the supreme spiritual life, ",
  "dn21:1.12.25": "but still you’re born in this lesser realm, ",
  "dn21:1.12.26": "a rebirth unbefitting. ",
  "dn21:1.12.27": "It’s a sad sight I see, good sirs, ",
  "dn21:1.12.28": "fellow practitioners in a lesser realm. ",
  "dn21:1.12.29": "Reborn in the host of centaurs, ",
  "dn21:1.12.30": "only to wait upon the gods. ",
  "dn21:1.12.31": "Meanwhile, I dwelt in a house—",
  "dn21:1.12.32": "but see my distinction now! ",
  "dn21:1.12.33": "Having been a woman now I’m a male god, ",
  "dn21:1.12.34": "blessed with heavenly sensual pleasures.” ",
  "dn21:1.12.35": "Scolded by that disciple of Gotama, ",
  "dn21:1.12.36": "comprehending Gopaka, they were struck with urgency. ",
  "dn21:1.12.37": "“Let’s strive, let’s try hard—",
  "dn21:1.12.38": "we won’t serve others any more!” ",
  "dn21:1.12.39": "Two of them roused up energy, ",
  "dn21:1.12.40": "recalling the Buddha’s instructions. ",
  "dn21:1.12.41": "Right away they became dispassionate, ",
  "dn21:1.12.42": "seeing the drawbacks in sensual pleasures. ",
  "dn21:1.12.43": "The fetters and bonds of sensual pleasures—",
  "dn21:1.12.44": "the ties of the Wicked One so hard to break—",
  "dn21:1.12.45": "they burst them like a bull elephant his ropes, ",
  "dn21:1.12.46": "and passed right over the Thirty-Three. ",
  "dn21:1.12.47": "The gods with Indra and the Progenitor ",
  "dn21:1.12.48": "were all gathered in the Hall of Justice. ",
  "dn21:1.12.49": "As they sat there, they passed over them, ",
  "dn21:1.12.50": "the heroes desireless, practicing purity. ",
  "dn21:1.12.51": "Seeing them, Vāsava was struck with urgency; ",
  "dn21:1.12.52": "the master of gods in the midst of the group said, ",
  "dn21:1.12.53": "“These were born in the lesser centaur realm, ",
  "dn21:1.12.54": "but now they pass us by!” ",
  "dn21:1.12.55": "Heeding the speech of one so moved, ",
  "dn21:1.12.56": "Gopaka addressed Vāsava, ",
  "dn21:1.12.57": "“There is a Buddha, a lord of men, in the world. ",
  "dn21:1.12.58": "Known as the Sakyan Sage, he’s mastered the senses. ",
  "dn21:1.12.59": "Those sons of his lost their memory; ",
  "dn21:1.12.60": "but when scolded by me they gained it back. ",
  "dn21:1.12.61": "Of the three, there is one who remains ",
  "dn21:1.12.62": "dwelling in the host of centaurs. ",
  "dn21:1.12.63": "But two, recollecting the path to awakening, ",
  "dn21:1.12.64": "serene, spurn even the gods. ",
  "dn21:1.12.65": "Of such power is the explanation of the teaching here: ",
  "dn21:1.12.66": "not a single disciple doubts that. ",
  "dn21:1.12.67": "We venerate the Buddha, the victor, lord of men, ",
  "dn21:1.12.68": "who has crossed the flood and cut off doubt. ",
  "dn21:1.12.69": "They attained distinction to the extent ",
  "dn21:1.12.70": "they understood the teaching here; ",
  "dn21:1.12.71": "two of them distinguished ",
  "dn21:1.12.72": "in the host of Brahmā’s Ministers.”’ ",
  "dn21:1.12.73": "We have come here, dear sir, ",
  "dn21:1.12.74": "to realize this same teaching. ",
  "dn21:1.12.75": "If the Buddha would give me a chance, ",
  "dn21:1.12.76": "I would ask a question, dear sir.” ",
  "dn21:1.13.1": "Then the Buddha thought, ",
  "dn21:1.13.2": "“For a long time now this spirit has led a pure life. Any question he asks me will be beneficial, not useless. ",
  "dn21:1.13.3": "And he will quickly understand any answer I give to his question.” ",
  "dn21:1.13.4": "So the Buddha addressed Sakka in verse: ",
  "dn21:1.13.5": "“Ask me your question, Vāsava, ",
  "dn21:1.13.6": "whatever you want. ",
  "dn21:1.13.7": "I’ll solve each and every ",
  "dn21:1.13.8": "question you have.” ",
  "dn21:1.13.9": "The first recitation section is finished. ",
  "dn21:2.1.1": "Having been granted an opportunity by the Buddha, Sakka asked the first question. ",
  "dn21:2.1.2": "“Dear sir, what fetters bind the gods, humans, titans, dragons, centaurs—and any of the other diverse creatures—",
  "dn21:2.1.3": "so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate?” ",
  "dn21:2.1.4": "Such was Sakka’s question to the Buddha. ",
  "dn21:2.1.5": "And the Buddha answered him: ",
  "dn21:2.1.6": "“Lord of gods, the fetters of jealousy and stinginess bind the gods, humans, titans, dragons, centaurs—and any of the other diverse creatures—",
  "dn21:2.1.7": "so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate.” ",
  "dn21:2.1.8": "Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka. ",
  "dn21:2.1.9": "Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying, ",
  "dn21:2.1.10": "“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! ",
  "dn21:2.1.11": "Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.” ",
  "dn21:2.2.1": "And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Sakka asked another question: ",
  "dn21:2.2.2": "“But dear sir, what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of jealousy and stinginess? ",
  "dn21:2.2.3": "When what exists is there jealousy and stinginess? ",
  "dn21:2.2.4": "When what doesn’t exist is there no jealousy and stinginess?” ",
  "dn21:2.2.5": "“The liked and the disliked, lord of gods, are the source of jealousy and stinginess. ",
  "dn21:2.2.6": "When the liked and the disliked exist there is jealousy and stinginess. ",
  "dn21:2.2.7": "When the liked and the disliked don’t exist there is no jealousy and stinginess.” ",
