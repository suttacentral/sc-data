  "dn8:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuññā, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala. ",
  "dn8:1.3": "Then the naked ascetic Kassapa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "dn8:1.4": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to the Buddha: ",
  "dn8:2.1": "“Worthy Gotama, I have heard the following: ",
  "dn8:2.2": "‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all fervent mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces all fervent mortifiers who live rough.’ ",
  "dn8:2.3": "Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism? ",
  "dn8:2.4": "For we don’t want to misrepresent the worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn8:3.1": "“Kassapa, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, baseless, and untrue. ",
  "dn8:3.2": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see some fervent mortifier who lives rough reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",

  "dn8:3.4": "I see some fervent mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a place of loss. ",
  "dn8:3.5": "But I see another fervent mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. ",
  "dn8:3.6": "Since I truly understand the coming and going, passing away and rebirth of these fervent mortifiers in this way, how could I criticize all forms of mortification, or categorically condemn and denounce those fervent mortifiers who live rough? ",
  "dn8:4.1": "There are some clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. ",

  "dn8:14.1": "When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha: ",
  "dn8:14.2": "“Reverend Gotama, those ascetics and brahmins consider these courses of fervent mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. ",
  "dn8:14.3": "They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on their behalf, or an invitation for a meal. ",
  "dn8:14.4": "They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a hound waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel. ",

  "dn8:14.7": "They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals. ",
  "dn8:14.8": "Those ascetics and brahmins also consider these courses of fervent mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. ",
  "dn8:14.9": "They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. ",
