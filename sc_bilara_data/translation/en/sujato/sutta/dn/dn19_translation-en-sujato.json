  "dn19:1.3": "Then, late at night, the centaur Pañcasikha, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, ",
  "dn19:1.4": "“Sir, I would tell you of what I heard and learned directly from the gods of the thirty-three.” ",
  "dn19:1.5": "“Tell me, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha. ",

  "dn19:2.1": "“Sir, it was more than a few days ago—on the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the invitation to admonish held at the end of the rainy season—when all the gods of the thirty-three were sitting together in the Hall of Clear Right. ",
  "dn19:2.2": "A large assembly of gods was sitting all around, and the four great kings were seated at the four quarters. ",

  "dn19:5.2": "How the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans! ",
  "dn19:5.3": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has such sympathy for the world, apart from the Buddha. ",
  "dn19:6.1": "Also, the Buddha has explained the teaching well—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. ",
  "dn19:6.2": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who explains such a relevant teaching, apart from the Buddha. ",
  "dn19:7.1": "Also, the Buddha has well described what is skillful and what is unskillful, ",
  "dn19:7.2": "what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright. ",
  "dn19:7.3": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes all these things, apart from the Buddha. ",
  "dn19:8.1": "Also, the Buddha has well described the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples. And extinguishment converges with the practice, ",
  "dn19:8.2": "as the waters of the Ganges come together and converge with the waters of the Yamuna. ",
  "dn19:8.3": "",
  "dn19:8.4": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples, apart from the Buddha. ",
  "dn19:9.1": "Also, possessions and popularity have accrued to the Buddha, so much that you’d think it would thrill even the aristocrats. But he takes his food free of vanity. ",
  "dn19:9.2": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who takes their food so free of vanity, apart from the Buddha. ",
  "dn19:10.1": "Also, the Buddha has gained companions, both trainees who are practicing, and those with defilements ended who have completed their journey. ",
  "dn19:10.2": "The Buddha is committed to the joy of solitude, but doesn’t send them away. ",
  "dn19:10.3": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, so committed to the joy of solitude, apart from the Buddha. ",
  "dn19:11.1": "Also, the Buddha does as he says, and says as he does, thus: he does as he says, and says as he does. ",
  "dn19:11.2": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so practices in line with the teaching, apart from the Buddha. ",
  "dn19:12.1": "Also, the Buddha has gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision. He has achieved all he wished for regarding the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life. ",
  "dn19:12.2": "I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has achieved these things, apart from the Buddha.’ ",
  "dn19:12.3": "These are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha proffered by Sakka. ",
  "dn19:12.4": "Hearing them, the gods of the thirty-three became even more uplifted and overjoyed. ",
  "dn19:13.1": "Then some gods thought, ",
  "dn19:13.2": "‘If only four fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! ",
  "dn19:13.3": "That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ ",
  "dn19:13.4": "Other gods thought, ",
  "dn19:13.5": "‘Let alone four fully awakened Buddhas; if only three fully awakened Buddhas, ",
  "dn19:13.6": "",
  "dn19:13.7": "",
  "dn19:13.8": "or two fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! ",
  "dn19:13.9": "That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ ",
  "dn19:14.1": "When they said this, Sakka said, ",
  "dn19:14.2": "‘It is impossible, gentlemen, for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time. ",
  "dn19:14.3": "May that Blessed One be healthy and well, and remain with us for a long time! ",
  "dn19:14.4": "That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ ",
  "dn19:14.5": "Then the gods of the thirty-three, having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Clear Right, advised and instructed the four great kings on the subject. ",
  "dn19:14.6": "Each one, having been advised, stood at his own seat without leaving. ",
  "dn19:14.7": "The Kings were instructed, ",
  "dn19:14.8": "and heeded good advice. ",
  "dn19:14.9": "With clear and peaceful minds, ",
  "dn19:14.10": "they stood by their own seats. ",
  "dn19:15.1": "Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods. ",
  "dn19:15.2": "Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the thirty-three, ",
  "dn19:15.3": "‘As indicated by the signs—light arising and radiance appearing—the Divinity will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of the Divinity, namely light arising and radiance appearing.’ ",
  "dn19:15.4": "",
  "dn19:15.5": "As indicated by the signs, ",
  "dn19:15.6": "the Divinity will appear. ",
  "dn19:15.7": "For this is the sign of the Divinity: ",
  "dn19:15.8": "a light vast and great. ",
  "dn19:16.0": "3. On Sanaṅkumāra ",
  "dn19:16.1": "Then the gods of the thirty-three sat in their own seats, saying, ",
  "dn19:16.2": "‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’ ",
  "dn19:16.3": "And the four great kings did likewise. ",
  "dn19:16.4": "",
  "dn19:16.5": "Hearing that, the gods of the thirty-three agreed in unison, ",
  "dn19:16.6": "‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’ ",
  "dn19:16.7": "When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal form. ",
  "dn19:16.8": "For a Divinity’s normal appearance is imperceptible in the visual range of the gods of the thirty-three. ",
  "dn19:16.9": "When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory, ",
  "dn19:16.10": "as a golden statue outshines the human form. ",
  "dn19:16.11": "",
  "dn19:16.12": "When the divinity Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the thirty-three, not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seat. ",
  "dn19:16.13": "They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised, thinking, ",
  "dn19:16.14": "‘Now the divinity Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses.’ ",
  "dn19:16.15": "And the god on whose couch the Divinity sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness, ",
  "dn19:17.1": "like a king on the day of his coronation. ",
  "dn19:17.2": "",
  "dn19:17.3": "Seeing the joy of those gods, the divinity Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses: ",
  "dn19:17.4": "‘The gods rejoice—",
  "dn19:17.5": "the thirty-three with their Lord—",
  "dn19:17.6": "revering the Realized One, ",

  "dn19:17.18": "revering the Realized One, ",
  "dn19:17.19": "and the clear rightness of the teaching!’ ",
  "dn19:18.1": "That is the topic on which the divinity Sanaṅkumāra spoke. ",
  "dn19:18.2": "And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had eight qualities: it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant. ",
  "dn19:18.3": "He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but the sound doesn’t extend outside the assembly. ",
  "dn19:18.4": "When someone has a voice like this, they’re said to have the voice of the Divinity. ",
  "dn19:19.1": "Then the gods of the thirty-three said to the divinity Sanaṅkumāra, ",
  "dn19:19.2": "‘Good, Great Divinity! Having appraised this, we rejoice. ",
  "dn19:19.3": "And there are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha spoken by Sakka—",
  "dn19:19.4": "having appraised them, too, we rejoice.’ ",
  "dn19:19.5.0": "4. Eight Genuine Praises ",
  "dn19:19.6": "Then the Divinity said to Sakka, ",
  "dn19:19.7": "‘It would be good, lord of gods, if I could also hear the eight genuine praises of the Buddha.’ ",

  "dn19:28.8": "‘What do the gods of the thirty-three think about the extent of the Buddha’s great wisdom? ",
  "dn19:29.1": "Once upon a time, there was a king named Disampati. ",
  "dn19:29.2": "He had a brahmin high priest named the Steward. ",
  "dn19:29.3": "Disampati’s son was the prince named Reṇu, ",

  "dn19:29.6": "In due course the brahmin Steward passed away. ",
  "dn19:29.7": "At his passing, King Disampati lamented, ",
  "dn19:29.8": "“At a time when I have relinquished all my duties to the brahmin Steward and amuse myself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, he passes away!” ",

  "dn19:29.10": "“Sire, don’t lament too much at the Steward’s passing. ",
  "dn19:29.11": "He has a son named Jotipāla, who is even more astute and expert than his father. ",
