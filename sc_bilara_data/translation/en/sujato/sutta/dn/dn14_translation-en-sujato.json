  "dn14:1.33.9": "Then King Bandhumā had the brahmin soothsayers dressed in unworn clothes and satisfied all their needs. ",
  "dn14:1.34.1": "Then the king appointed nursemaids for Prince Vipassī. ",
  "dn14:1.34.2": "Some suckled him, some bathed him, some held him, and some carried him on their hip. ",
  "dn14:1.34.3": "From when he was born, a white parasol was held over him night and day, with the thought, ",
  "dn14:1.34.4": "‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother him.’ ",
  "dn14:1.34.5": "He was dear and beloved by many people, ",

  "dn14:1.34.7": "",
  "dn14:1.34.8": "He was always passed from hip to hip. ",
  "dn14:1.35.1": "From when he was born, his voice was charming, graceful, sweet, and lovely. ",
  "dn14:1.35.2": "It was as sweet as the song of a cuckoo-bird found in the Himalayas. ",
  "dn14:1.35.3": "",
  "dn14:1.36.1": "From when he was born, Prince Vipassī had the power of clairvoyance which manifested as a result of past deeds, by which he could see for a league all around both by day and by night. ",
  "dn14:1.37.1": "And he was unblinkingly watchful, like the gods of the thirty-three. ",
  "dn14:1.37.2": "And because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful, he came to be known as ‘Vipassī’. ",
  "dn14:1.37.3": "Then while King Bandhumā was sitting in court, he’d sit Prince Vipassī in his lap and explain the case to him. ",
  "dn14:1.37.4": "And sitting there in his father’s lap, Vipassī would thoroughly consider the case and draw a conclusion using a logical system. ",
  "dn14:1.37.5": "So this was all the more reason for him to be known as ‘Vipassī’. ",
  "dn14:1.38.1": "Then King Bandhumā had three stilt longhouses built for him—one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season, ",
  "dn14:1.38.2": "and provided him with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. ",
  "dn14:1.38.3": "Prince Vipassī stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where he was entertained by musicians—none of them men. ",

  "dn14:2.1.6": "Then Prince Vipassī mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out for the park. ",
  "dn14:2.2.1": "Along the way he saw an elderly man, bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as he walked, ailing, past his prime. ",
