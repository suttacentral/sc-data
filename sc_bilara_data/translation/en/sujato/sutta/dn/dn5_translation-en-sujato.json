  "dn5:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "dn5:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata. ",
  "dn5:1.3": "There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā. ",
  "dn5:1.4": "Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. ",
  "dn5:1.5": "Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:1.6": "Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—seven hundred of each—had been led to the post for the sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:2.1": "The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumata heard: ",
  "dn5:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. ",
  "dn5:2.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "dn5:2.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "dn5:2.5": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "dn5:2.6": "He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "dn5:2.7": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "dn5:2.8": "Then, exiting Khāṇumata, they formed into companies and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā. ",
  "dn5:3.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. ",
  "dn5:3.2": "He saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā, ",
  "dn5:3.3": "and addressed his butler, ",

  "dn5:4.6": "Why don’t I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories?” ",
  "dn5:4.7": "Then Kūṭadanta addressed his butler, ",
  "dn5:4.8": "“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: ",
  "dn5:4.9": "‘Sirs, the brahmin Kūṭadanta asks ",

  "dn5:9.8": "“Yes, worthy sir,” Kūṭadanta replied. ",
  "dn5:9.9": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "dn5:10.1": "“Once upon a time, brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. ",
  "dn5:10.2": "Then as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: ",
  "dn5:10.3": "‘I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I hold a large sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ ",
  "dn5:10.4": "Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: ",
  "dn5:10.5": "‘Just now, brahmin, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind, ",
  "dn5:10.6": "“I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I perform a great sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” ",
  "dn5:10.7": "Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:10.8": "Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ ",
  "dn5:11.1": "When he had spoken, the brahmin high priest said to him: ",
  "dn5:11.2": "‘Sir, the king’s realm is harried and oppressed. Raiding of villages, towns, and cities has been seen, and infesting of highways. ",
  "dn5:11.3": "But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed, he would not be doing his duty. ",
  "dn5:11.4": "Now the king might think, ",
  "dn5:11.5": "“I’ll eradicate this plague of savages by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment!” But that’s not the right way to eradicate this plague of savages. ",
  "dn5:11.6": "Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the king’s realm. ",
  "dn5:11.7": "Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the plague of savages will be properly uprooted. ",
  "dn5:11.8": "So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in growing crops and raising cattle. ",
  "dn5:11.9": "Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade. ",
  "dn5:11.10": "Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service. ",
  "dn5:11.11": "Then the people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm. ",
  "dn5:11.12": "The king’s revenues will be great. ",
  "dn5:11.13": "When the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell as if their houses were wide open.’ ",
  "dn5:11.14": "The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation. ",

  "dn5:11.16": "",
  "dn5:11.17": "",
  "dn5:11.18": "",
  "dn5:11.19": "Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: ",
  "dn5:11.20": "‘I have eradicated the plague of savages. And relying on your plan my revenue is now great. ",
  "dn5:11.21": "Since the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, dwell as if their houses were wide open. ",
  "dn5:11.22": "Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:11.23": "Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ ",
  "dn5:12.0": "4.1. The Four Accessories ",
  "dn5:12.1": "‘In that case, let the king announce this throughout the realm to the aristocrat vassals of both town and country; the ministers and councillors of both town and country; the well-to-do brahmins of both town and country; and the well-off householders of both town and country. ",
  "dn5:12.2": "“I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please grant your approval, good fellows; it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” ",
  "dn5:12.3": "The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation. ",
  "dn5:12.4": "And all of the people who were thus informed responded by saying: ",

  "dn5:12.6": "",
  "dn5:12.7": "",

  "dn5:13.0": "4.2. The Eight Accessories ",
  "dn5:13.1": "King Mahāvijita possessed eight factors. ",
  "dn5:13.2": "He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. ",
  "dn5:13.3": "He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He had divine looks and lustre, remarkable to behold. ",
  "dn5:13.4": "He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. ",
  "dn5:13.5": "He was powerful, having an army of four divisions that was obedient and carried out instructions. He’d probably prevail over his enemies just with his reputation. ",
  "dn5:13.6": "He was faithful, generous, a donor, his door always open. He was a well-spring of support, making merit with ascetics and brahmins, for paupers, vagrants, supplicants, and beggars. ",
  "dn5:13.7": "He was very learned in diverse fields of learning. He understood the meaning of diverse statements, saying: ",
  "dn5:13.8": "‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’ ",
  "dn5:13.9": "He was astute, competent, and intelligent, able to think issues through as they bear upon the past, future, and present. ",
  "dn5:13.10": "These are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessed. ",
  "dn5:13.11": "And so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:14.0": "4.3. Four More Accessories ",
  "dn5:14.1": "And the brahmin high priest had four factors. ",
  "dn5:14.2": "He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. ",
  "dn5:14.3": "He recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. ",
  "dn5:14.4": "He was ethical, mature in ethical conduct. ",
  "dn5:14.5": "He was astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. ",
  "dn5:14.6": "These are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessed. ",
  "dn5:14.7": "And so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:15.0": "4.4. The Three Modes ",
  "dn5:15.1": "Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest taught the three modes to the king. ",
  "dn5:15.2": "‘Now, though the king wants to perform a great sacrifice, he might have certain regrets, thinking: ",
  "dn5:15.3": "“I shall lose a great fortune,” or ",

  "dn5:15.5": "“I am losing a great fortune,” or ",
  "dn5:15.6": "",
  "dn5:15.7": "“I have lost a great fortune.” But the king should not harbor such regrets.’ ",
  "dn5:15.8": "These are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the king before the sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:16.0": "4.5. The Ten Respects ",
  "dn5:16.1": "Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients in ten respects: ",
  "dn5:16.2": "‘There will come to the sacrifice those who kill living creatures and those who refrain from killing living creatures. ",
  "dn5:16.3": "As to those who kill living creatures, the outcome of that is theirs alone. ",
  "dn5:16.4": "But as to those who refrain from killing living creatures, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. ",
  "dn5:16.5": "There will come to the sacrifice those who steal … ",
  "dn5:16.6": "commit sexual misconduct … ",

  "dn5:19.1": "Then the aristocrat vassals, ministers and councillors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders came to the king bringing abundant wealth and said, ",
  "dn5:19.2": "‘Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you alone; may Your Highness accept it!’ ",
  "dn5:19.3": "‘There’s enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for you; and here, take even more!’ ",
  "dn5:19.4": "",
  "dn5:19.5": "When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a plan, ",
  "dn5:19.6": "‘It wouldn’t be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homes. ",
  "dn5:19.7": "King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice. Let us make an offering as an auxiliary sacrifice.’ ",
  "dn5:20.1": "Then the aristocrat vassals of town and country set up gifts to the east of the sacrificial enclosure. ",
  "dn5:20.2": "The ministers and councillors of town and country set up gifts to the south of the sacrificial enclosure. ",
  "dn5:20.3": "The well-to-do brahmins of town and country set up gifts to the west of the sacrificial enclosure. ",
  "dn5:20.4": "The well-off householders of town and country set up gifts to the north of the sacrificial enclosure. ",
  "dn5:20.5": "And brahmin, in that sacrifice too no cattle were killed, no goats were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice. ",
  "dn5:20.6": "No bondservants, servants, or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. ",
  "dn5:20.7": "Those who wished to work did so, while those who did not wish to did not. ",
  "dn5:20.8": "They did the work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn’t want to. ",
  "dn5:20.9": "The sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses. ",
  "dn5:20.10": "And so there were four consenting factions, eight factors possessed by King Mahāvijita, four factors possessed by the high priest, ",

  "dn5:20.12": "Brahmin, this is called the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.” ",
  "dn5:21.1": "When he said this, those brahmins made an uproar, ",
  "dn5:21.2": "“Hooray for such sacrifice! Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrifice!” ",
  "dn5:21.3": "But the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silence. ",
  "dn5:21.4": "So those brahmins said to him, ",
  "dn5:21.5": "“How can you not applaud the ascetic Gotama’s fine words?” ",
  "dn5:21.6": "“It’s not that I don’t applaud what he said. ",
  "dn5:21.7": "If anyone didn’t applaud such fine words, their head would explode! ",
  "dn5:21.8": "But, gentlemen, it occurs to me that ",
  "dn5:21.9": "the ascetic Gotama does not say: ",
  "dn5:21.10": "‘So I have heard’ or ‘It ought to be like this.’ ",
  "dn5:21.11": "Rather, he just says: ",
  "dn5:21.12": "‘So it was then, this is how it was then.’ ",
  "dn5:21.13": "It occurs to me that ",
  "dn5:21.14": "the ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King Mahāvijita, the owner of the sacrifice, or else the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for him. ",
  "dn5:21.15": "Does the worthy Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice, or having facilitated it, and then, when his body broke up, after death, being reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?” ",
  "dn5:21.16": "“I do recall that, brahmin. For I myself was the brahmin high priest at that time who facilitated the sacrifice.” ",

  "dn5:23.2": "“Because neither perfected ones nor those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice. ",

  "dn5:28.0": "6. Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower ",
  "dn5:28.1": "When he had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, ",
  "dn5:28.2": "“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ",
  "dn5:28.3": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. ",
