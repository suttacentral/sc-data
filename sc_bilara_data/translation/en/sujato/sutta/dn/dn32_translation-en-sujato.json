  "dn32:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "dn32:1.3": "Then, late at night, the Four Great Kings—with large armies of spirits, centaurs, goblins, and dragons—set guards, troops, and wards at the four quarters and then, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak with their beauty, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. ",
  "dn32:1.4": "Before sitting down to one side, some spirits bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. ",

  "dn32:2.12": "They don’t like that or approve of it. ",
  "dn32:2.13": "Sir, there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat. ",
