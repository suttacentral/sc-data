  "dn17:1.15.4": "When it was cool her limbs were warm, and when it was warm her limbs were cool. ",
  "dn17:1.15.5": "The fragrance of sandal floated from her body, and lotus from her mouth. ",
  "dn17:1.15.6": "She got up before the king and went to bed after him, and was obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. ",
  "dn17:1.15.7": "The woman-treasure did not betray the wheel-turning monarch even in thought, still less in deed. ",
