  "dn13:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "dn13:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Manasākaṭa. ",
  "dn13:1.3": "He stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa. ",
  "dn13:2.1": "Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa. They included ",
  "dn13:2.2": "the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. ",
  "dn13:3.1": "Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding what is the path and what is not the path. ",
  "dn13:4.1": "Vāseṭṭha said this: ",
  "dn13:4.2": "“This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Pokkharasāti.” ",
  "dn13:5.1": "Bhāradvāja said this: ",
  "dn13:5.2": "“This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity; namely, that explained by the brahmin Tārukkha.” ",
  "dn13:6.1": "But neither was able to persuade the other. ",
  "dn13:7.1": "So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, ",
  "dn13:7.2": "“Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa. ",
  "dn13:7.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "dn13:7.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "dn13:7.5": "Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. ",
  "dn13:7.6": "As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” ",
  "dn13:7.7": "“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. ",
  "dn13:8.0": "1. What is the Path and What is Not the Path ",
  "dn13:8.1": "So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "dn13:8.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation, adding: ",

  "dn13:8.5": "",
  "dn13:8.6": "",
  "dn13:8.7": "",
  "dn13:8.8": "“In this matter we have a dispute, a disagreement, a difference of opinion.” ",
  "dn13:9.1": "“So, Vāseṭṭha, it seems that you say that ",
  "dn13:9.2": "the straight path is that explained by Pokkharasāti, ",
  "dn13:9.3": "while Bhāradvāja says that ",
  "dn13:9.4": "the straight path is that explained by Tārukkha. ",
  "dn13:9.5": "But what exactly is your disagreement about?” ",
  "dn13:10.1": "“About what is the path and what is not the path, worthy Gotama. ",
  "dn13:10.2": "Even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity. ",
  "dn13:10.3": "It’s like a village or town that has many different roads nearby, yet all of them meet at that village. ",
  "dn13:10.4": "In the same way, even though brahmins describe different paths—the Adhvaryu brahmins, the Taittirīya brahmins, the Chāndogya brahmins, the Cāndrāyaṇa brahmins, and the Bahvṛca brahmins—all of them still lead someone who practices them to the company of Divinity.” ",

  "dn13:12.1": "“Well, of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas, Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single one who has seen the Divinity with their own eyes?” ",
  "dn13:12.2": "“No, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:12.3": "“Well, has even a single one of their tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?” ",
  "dn13:12.4": "“No, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:12.5": "“Well, has even a single one of their tutors’ tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?” ",
  "dn13:12.6": "“No, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:12.7": "“Well, has anyone back to the seventh generation of tutors seen the Divinity with their own eyes?” ",
  "dn13:12.8": "“No, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:13.1": "“Well, what of the ancient seers of the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught. ",
  "dn13:13.2": "Did they say: ",
  "dn13:13.3": "‘We know and see where the Divinity is or what way he lies’?” ",
  "dn13:13.4": "“No, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:14.1": "“So it seems that none of those brahmins have seen the Divinity with their own eyes, ",

  "dn13:14.3": "",
  "dn13:14.4": "",
  "dn13:14.5": "and not even the ancient seers ",

  "dn13:14.9": "This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of Divinity.’ ",
  "dn13:14.10": "What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? ",
  "dn13:14.11": "This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” ",
  "dn13:14.12": "“Clearly that’s the case, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:15.1": "“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. ",
  "dn13:15.2": "Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. ",
  "dn13:15.3": "In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. ",
  "dn13:15.4": "Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, vacuous and hollow. ",
  "dn13:16.1": "What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? ",
  "dn13:16.2": "Do the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do? And do they supplicate and entreat them, following their course from where they rise to where they set with joined palms held in worship?” ",
  "dn13:16.3": "“Yes, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:17.1": "“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? ",
  "dn13:17.2": "Though this is so, are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon, saying: ",
  "dn13:17.3": "‘This is the only straight path, the direct route that delivers one who practices it to the company of the sun and moon’?” ",
  "dn13:17.4": "“No, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "dn13:18.1": "“So it seems that even though the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon, they are not able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon. ",

  "dn13:32.11": "“They do not.” ",
  "dn13:33.1": "“So it seems that the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are encumbered with possessions, but the Divinity is not. ",
  "dn13:33.2": "But would brahmins who are encumbered with possessions join together and converge with the Divinity, who isn’t encumbered with possessions?” ",
  "dn13:33.3": "“No, worthy Gotama.” ",

  "dn13:36.1": "“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s impossible that brahmins who are opposite to the Divinity in all these things will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Divinity. ",
  "dn13:36.2": "Now in this regard, Vāseṭṭha, those brahmins proficient in the three Vedas, having dived in, sink down. Having sunk down, they undergo drowning, imagining they are crossing to the dry shore. ",
  "dn13:36.3": "That’s why the three Vedas of the brahmins are called a ‘salted land’ and a ‘barren land’ and a ‘disaster’.” ",
  "dn13:37.1": "When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha, ",
