  "dn4:1.3": "where he stayed by the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. ",
  "dn4:1.4": "Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in Campā. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. ",
  "dn4:2.1": "The brahmins and householders of Campā heard: ",
  "dn4:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. ",
  "dn4:2.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "dn4:2.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "dn4:2.5": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "dn4:2.6": "He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "dn4:2.7": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "dn4:2.8": "Then, exiting Campā, they formed into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. ",
  "dn4:3.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. ",
  "dn4:3.2": "He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pond, ",

  "dn4:6.28": "He leads an order and a community, and tutors a community, and is said to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn’t come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins. ",
  "dn4:6.29": "Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. … ",
  "dn4:6.30": "King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … ",

  "dn4:7.0": "4. Soṇadaṇḍa Has Second Thoughts ",
  "dn4:7.1": "Then Soṇadaṇḍa together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha. ",
  "dn4:8.1": "But as he reached the far side of the forest, this thought came to mind, ",
  "dn4:8.2": "“Suppose I was to ask the ascetic Gotama a question. ",
  "dn4:8.3": "He might say to me: ",
  "dn4:8.4": "‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t ask your question like that. This is how you should ask it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: ",

  "dn4:8.6": "And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. ",
  "dn4:8.7": "When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. ",
  "dn4:8.8": "But my wealth relies on my reputation. ",
  "dn4:8.9": "Or if the ascetic Gotama asks me a question, I might not satisfy him with my answer. ",
  "dn4:8.10": "He might say to me: ",
  "dn4:8.11": "‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t answer the question like that. This is how you should answer it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: ",
  "dn4:8.12": "‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to satisfy the ascetic Gotama’s mind with his answer.’ ",
  "dn4:8.13": "And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. ",
  "dn4:8.14": "When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. ",
  "dn4:8.15": "But my wealth relies on my reputation. ",
  "dn4:8.16": "On the other hand, if I were to turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama, the assembly might disparage me for that: ",
  "dn4:8.17": "‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s stuck-up and scared. He doesn’t dare to go and see the ascetic Gotama. For how on earth can he turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama!’ ",
  "dn4:8.18": "And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. ",
  "dn4:8.19": "When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. ",
  "dn4:8.20": "But my wealth relies on my reputation.” ",
  "dn4:9.1": "Then Soṇadaṇḍa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "dn4:9.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. ",
  "dn4:9.3": "Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Campā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. ",
  "dn4:10.1": "But while sitting there, Soṇadaṇḍa continued to be plagued by many second thoughts. He thought, ",

  "dn4:11.0": "5. What Makes a Brahmin ",

  "dn4:11.2": "“This brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is troubled by his own thoughts. ",
  "dn4:11.3": "Why don’t I ask him about his own tutor’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas?” ",

  "dn4:24.2": "“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ",
  "dn4:24.3": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "dn4:24.4": "I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
