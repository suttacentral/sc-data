  "sn6.2:2.1": "Then it occurred to him: ",
  "sn6.2:2.2": "“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. ",

  "sn6.2:6.3": "Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?” ",
  "sn6.2:7.1": "Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. ",
  "sn6.2:7.2": "He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: ",

  "sn6.2:9.3": "and they also will live. ",
  "sn6.2:9.4": "This is the nature of the Buddhas. ",
  "sn6.2:10.1": "Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare, ",
