  "sn42.9:2.3": "Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to the Jain Ñātika, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Jain Ñātika said to him: ",
  "sn42.9:2.4": "“Come, chief, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. ",
  "sn42.9:2.5": "Then you will get a good reputation: ",
  "sn42.9:2.6": "‘Asibandhaka’s son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’” ",

  "sn42.9:4.3": "“So what then are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw? ",
  "sn42.9:4.4": "The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!” ",

  "sn42.9:4.12": "Unless they give up that speech and that thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.” ",
  "sn42.9:5.1": "When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha, ",
  "sn42.9:5.2": "“Excellent, sir! Excellent! … ",
