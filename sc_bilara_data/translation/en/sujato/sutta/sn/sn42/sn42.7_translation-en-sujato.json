  "sn42.7:2.1": "“To me, the monks and nuns are like the good field. ",
  "sn42.7:2.2": "I teach them the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And I reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "sn42.7:2.3": "Why is that? ",

  "sn42.7:3.4": "Why is that? ",
  "sn42.7:3.5": "Because at least it can be used for washing the dishes.” ",
  "sn42.7:4.1": "“To me, the monks and nuns are like the water jar that’s uncracked and nonporous. ",
