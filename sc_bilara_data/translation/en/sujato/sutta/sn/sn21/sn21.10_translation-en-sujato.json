  "sn21.10:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "sn21.10:1.2": "Now at that time there was a certain mendicant named Senior. He lived alone and praised living alone. ",
  "sn21.10:1.3": "He entered the village for alms alone, returned alone, sat in private alone, and concentrated on walking mindfully alone. ",
  "sn21.10:1.4": "Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
  "sn21.10:1.5": "“Sir, there’s a certain mendicant named Senior who lives alone and praises living alone.” ",
  "sn21.10:2.1": "So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, ",
  "sn21.10:2.2": "“Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Senior that ",
  "sn21.10:2.3": "the teacher summons him.” ",
  "sn21.10:2.4": "“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Venerable Senior and said to him, ",
  "sn21.10:2.5": "“Reverend Senior, the teacher summons you.” ",
  "sn21.10:2.6": "“Yes, reverend,” that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: ",
  "sn21.10:2.7": "“Is it really true, Senior, that you live alone and praise living alone?” ",
  "sn21.10:2.8": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "sn21.10:2.9": "“But in what way do you live alone and praise living alone?” ",
  "sn21.10:2.10": "“Well, sir, I enter the village for alms alone, return alone, sit in private alone, and concentrate on walking mindfully alone. ",
  "sn21.10:2.11": "That’s how I live alone and praise living alone.” ",
  "sn21.10:3.1": "“That is a kind of living alone, I don’t deny it. ",
  "sn21.10:3.2": "But as to how living alone is fulfilled in detail, ",
  "sn21.10:3.3": "listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” ",
  "sn21.10:3.4": "“Yes, sir,” he replied. ",
  "sn21.10:3.5": "“And how, Senior, is living alone fulfilled in detail? ",
  "sn21.10:3.6": "It’s when what’s in the past is given up, what’s in the future is relinquished, and desire and greed for present incarnations is eliminated. ",
  "sn21.10:3.7": "That’s how living alone is fulfilled in detail.” ",
  "sn21.10:4.1": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "sn21.10:4.2": "Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: ",
  "sn21.10:5.1": "“The champion, all-knower, so very intelligent, ",
  "sn21.10:5.2": "is unsullied in the midst of all things. ",
  "sn21.10:5.3": "He’s given up all, freed in the ending of craving: ",
  "sn21.10:5.4": "I declare that man to be one who lives alone.” "
