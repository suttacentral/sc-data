  "sn44.2:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. ",
  "sn44.2:1.2": "Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. ",
  "sn44.2:1.3": "Then several wanderers of other religions went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "sn44.2:1.4": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: ",
  "sn44.2:1.5": "“Reverend Anurādha, when a realized one is describing a realized one—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: ",
  "sn44.2:1.6": "After death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.” ",
  "sn44.2:1.7": "“Reverends, when a realized one is describing a realized one—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: ",
  "sn44.2:1.8": "After death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.” ",
  "sn44.2:1.9": "When he said this, the wanderers said to him, ",
  "sn44.2:1.10": "“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” ",
  "sn44.2:1.11": "Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left. ",
  "sn44.2:2.1": "Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought, ",
  "sn44.2:2.2": "“If those wanderers were to inquire further, ",
  "sn44.2:2.3": "how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?” ",
  "sn44.2:2.4": "Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

  "sn44.2:15.6": "Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. ",
