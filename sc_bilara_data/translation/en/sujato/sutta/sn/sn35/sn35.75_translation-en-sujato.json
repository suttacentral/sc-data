  "sn35.75:3.2": "I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” ",
  "sn35.75:4.1": "“In that case, mendicant, why do you have remorse and regret?” ",
  "sn35.75:5.1": "“Because I understand that the Buddha has not taught the Dhamma merely for the sake of ethical purity.” ",

  "sn35.75:12.1": "“Impermanent, sir.” ",
  "sn35.75:13.1": "“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” ",
  "sn35.75:14.1": "“Suffering, sir.” ",
  "sn35.75:15.1": "“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ",
