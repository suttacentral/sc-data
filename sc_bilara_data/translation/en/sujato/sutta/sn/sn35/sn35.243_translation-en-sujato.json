  "sn35.243:1.5": "May the Buddha be the first to use it, ",
  "sn35.243:1.6": "and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it. ",
  "sn35.243:1.7": "That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.” ",
  "sn35.243:1.8": "The Buddha consented with silence. ",
  "sn35.243:2.1": "Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed an oil lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha and told him of their preparations, saying, ",

  "sn35.243:2.9": "Please go at your convenience.” ",
  "sn35.243:2.10": "“Yes, sir,” replied the Sakyans. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. ",
  "sn35.243:3.1": "And then, soon after the Sakyans had left, the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, ",
