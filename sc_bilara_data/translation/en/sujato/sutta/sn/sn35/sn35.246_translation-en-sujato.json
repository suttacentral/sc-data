  "sn35.246:2.2": "but the caretaker is negligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops they’d indulge themselves as much as they like. ",
  "sn35.246:2.3": "In the same way, when an unlearned ordinary person doesn’t exercise restraint when it comes to the six fields of contact, they indulge themselves in the five kinds of sensual stimulation as much as they like. ",
  "sn35.246:3.1": "Suppose the crops have ripened, and the caretaker is diligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops ",
  "sn35.246:3.2": "the caretaker would grab them firmly by the muzzle. ",
  "sn35.246:3.3": "Then they’d grab them above the hump and hold them fast there. ",

  "sn35.246:3.13": "remembering the beating they got earlier. ",
  "sn35.246:3.14": "In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is subdued, well subdued when it comes to the six fields of contact, becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. ",

  "sn35.246:4.4": "‘My man, what is making this sound, so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, infatuating, and captivating?’ ",

  "sn35.246:4.15": "‘Sir, this arched harp is made of many components assembled together, ",

  "sn35.246:4.17": "it depends on the body, the skin, the neck, the head, the strings, the plectrum, and a person to play it properly. That’s how an arched harp is made of many components assembled together, ",
  "sn35.246:4.18": "which make a sound when they’re played.’ ",
  "sn35.246:4.19": "But he’d split that harp into ten pieces or a hundred pieces, then splinter it up. ",
  "sn35.246:4.20": "He’d burn the splinters with fire, and reduce them to ashes. ",
