  "sn35.240:1.2": "At the same time, a jackal was also hunting along the river bank. ",
  "sn35.240:1.3": "The tortoise saw the jackal off in the distance hunting, ",
  "sn35.240:1.4": "so it drew its limbs and neck inside its shell, and kept passive and silent. ",
  "sn35.240:1.5": "But the jackal also saw the tortoise off in the distance grazing. ",
  "sn35.240:1.6": "So it went up to the tortoise and waiting nearby, thinking, ",
  "sn35.240:1.7": "‘When that tortoise sticks one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, I’ll grab it right there, rip it out, and eat it!’ ",
  "sn35.240:1.8": "But when that tortoise didn’t stick one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, the jackal left disappointed, since it couldn’t find a vulnerability. ",
