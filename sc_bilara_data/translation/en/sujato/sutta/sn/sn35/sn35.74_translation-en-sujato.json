  "sn35.74:1.1": "At Sāvatthī. ",
  "sn35.74:1.2": "Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, and said to him, ",
  "sn35.74:1.3": "“Sir, in such and such a monastery there’s a mendicant who is junior and not well-known. He’s sick, suffering, gravely ill. ",
  "sn35.74:1.4": "Please go to him out of sympathy.” ",
  "sn35.74:2.1": "When the Buddha heard that the mendicant was junior and ill, understanding that he was not well-known, he went to him. ",
  "sn35.74:2.2": "That mendicant saw the Buddha coming off in the distance ",
  "sn35.74:2.3": "and tried to rise on his cot. ",
  "sn35.74:2.4": "The Buddha said to that monk, ",
  "sn35.74:2.5": "“It’s all right, mendicant, don’t get up. ",

  "sn35.74:2.7": "He sat on the seat spread out ",
  "sn35.74:2.8": "and said to the mendicant, ",
  "sn35.74:2.9": "“I hope you’re keeping well, mendicant; I hope you’re all right. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” ",
  "sn35.74:3.1": "“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not getting by. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” ",
  "sn35.74:4.1": "“I hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?” ",
  "sn35.74:5.1": "“Indeed, sir, I have no little remorse and regret.” ",
  "sn35.74:6.1": "“I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?” ",
  "sn35.74:7.1": "“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” ",
  "sn35.74:8.1": "“In that case, mendicant, why do you have remorse and regret?” ",
  "sn35.74:9.1": "“Because I understand that the Buddha has not taught the Dhamma merely for the sake of ethical purity.” ",
  "sn35.74:10.1": "“If that is so, what then do you understand to be the purpose of teaching the Dhamma?” ",
  "sn35.74:11.1": "“I understand that the Buddha has taught the Dhamma for the purpose of the fading away of greed.” ",
  "sn35.74:12.1": "“Good, good, mendicant! ",
  "sn35.74:12.2": "It’s good that you understand that I’ve taught the Dhamma for the purpose of the fading away of greed. ",

  "sn35.74:12.4": "What do you think, mendicant? ",
  "sn35.74:12.5": "Is the eye permanent or impermanent?” ",
  "sn35.74:13.1": "“Impermanent, sir.” … ",

  "sn35.74:14.6": "mind permanent or impermanent?” ",
  "sn35.74:15.1": "“Impermanent, sir.” ",
  "sn35.74:16.1": "“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” ",
  "sn35.74:17.1": "“Suffering, sir.” ",
  "sn35.74:18.1": "“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ",
  "sn35.74:18.2": "‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” ",
  "sn35.74:19.1": "“No, sir.” ",
  "sn35.74:20.1": "“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. ",
  "sn35.74:20.2": "Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "sn35.74:20.3": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended … there is nothing further for this place.’” ",
  "sn35.74:21.1": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "sn35.74:21.2": "Satisfied, that mendicant approved what the Buddha said. ",
