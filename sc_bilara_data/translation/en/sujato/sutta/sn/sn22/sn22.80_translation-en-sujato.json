  "sn22.80:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. ",
  "sn22.80:1.2": "Then the Buddha, having dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha for some reason, robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms. ",
  "sn22.80:1.3": "He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood for the day’s meditation, ",
  "sn22.80:1.4": "plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood-apple tree to meditate. ",
  "sn22.80:2.1": "Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, ",
  "sn22.80:2.2": "“I have purged the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "sn22.80:2.3": "But there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. ",
  "sn22.80:2.4": "Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. ",
  "sn22.80:2.5": "If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart. … ",
  "sn22.80:2.6": "",
  "sn22.80:2.7": "Or if young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart. ",
  "sn22.80:2.8": "In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. ",
  "sn22.80:2.9": "Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. ",
  "sn22.80:2.10": "Why don’t I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the past?” ",
  "sn22.80:3.1": "Then the divinity Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the realm of divinity and reappeared in front of the Buddha. ",
  "sn22.80:3.2": "He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: ",
  "sn22.80:3.3": "“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! ",
  "sn22.80:3.4": "The Buddha has purged the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "sn22.80:3.5": "But there are mendicants who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. … ",

  "sn22.80:3.13": "May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!” ",
  "sn22.80:4.1": "The Buddha consented with silence. ",
  "sn22.80:4.2": "Then the divinity Sahampati, knowing that the Buddha had consented, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. ",
  "sn22.80:5.1": "Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, where he sat on the seat spread out. ",
  "sn22.80:5.2": "Then he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly, alone or in pairs. ",
  "sn22.80:5.3": "Those mendicants approached the Buddha timidly, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: ",
  "sn22.80:6.1": "“This is the last of lifestyles, mendicants, namely relying on alms. ",
  "sn22.80:6.2": "The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’ ",
  "sn22.80:6.3": "Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason. ",
  "sn22.80:6.4": "Not to escape a summons by a king or a summons for a bandit, or because you were in debt or in fear, or in order to make a living. ",
  "sn22.80:6.5": "But because they’re swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. ",
  "sn22.80:6.6": "And they think, ‘Hopefully I can make an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ ",
  "sn22.80:7.1": "That’s how this gentleman has gone forth. ",
  "sn22.80:7.2": "Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. ",
  "sn22.80:7.3": "Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness. ",
  "sn22.80:7.4": "I say that individual is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life. ",
  "sn22.80:8.1": "There are these three unskillful thoughts. ",
  "sn22.80:8.2": "Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. ",
  "sn22.80:8.3": "And where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over? ",
  "sn22.80:8.4": "In those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation; or who develop signless immersion. ",
  "sn22.80:8.5": "This is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion. ",
  "sn22.80:8.6": "When signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial. ",
  "sn22.80:9.1": "There are these two views. ",
  "sn22.80:9.2": "Views favoring existence and views favoring nonexistence. ",
  "sn22.80:9.3": "A learned noble disciple reflects on this: ",
  "sn22.80:9.4": "‘Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault?’ ",
  "sn22.80:9.5": "They understand: ",
  "sn22.80:9.6": "‘There’s nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault. ",
  "sn22.80:9.7": "For in grasping I would grasp only at form, feeling, ",
  "sn22.80:9.8": "perception, ",
  "sn22.80:9.9": "choices, or consciousness. ",
  "sn22.80:9.10": "That grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence. ",
  "sn22.80:9.11": "Continued existence is a requirement for rebirth. ",
  "sn22.80:9.12": "Rebirth is a requirement for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. ",
  "sn22.80:9.13": "That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.’ ",
  "sn22.80:10.1": "What do you think, mendicants? ",
  "sn22.80:10.2": "Is form permanent or impermanent?” ",
  "sn22.80:10.3": "“Impermanent, sir.” ",
  "sn22.80:10.4": "“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” ",
  "sn22.80:10.5": "“Suffering, sir.” ",
  "sn22.80:10.6": "“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ",
  "sn22.80:10.7": "‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” ",
  "sn22.80:10.8": "“No, sir.” ",
  "sn22.80:10.9": "“Is feeling … ",

  "sn22.80:10.12": "consciousness permanent or impermanent?” … ",
