  "sn22.86:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. ",
  "sn22.86:1.2": "Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. ",
  "sn22.86:1.3": "Then several wanderers of other religions went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "sn22.86:1.4": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: ",
  "sn22.86:1.5": "“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a realized one—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: ",
  "sn22.86:1.6": "After death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.” ",
  "sn22.86:2.1": "When they said this, Venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers: ",

  "sn22.86:2.4": "When he said this, the wanderers said to him: ",
  "sn22.86:2.5": "“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” ",
  "sn22.86:2.6": "Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seats and left. ",
  "sn22.86:3.1": "Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought: ",
  "sn22.86:3.2": "“If those wanderers were to inquire further, ",
  "sn22.86:3.3": "how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuttal and criticism?” ",
  "sn22.86:4.1": "Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened. ",
