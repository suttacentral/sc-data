  "sn22.87:1.2": "Now at that time Venerable Vakkali was staying in a potter’s shed, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. ",
  "sn22.87:1.3": "Then he addressed his carers, ",
  "sn22.87:1.4": "“Please, reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ",
  "sn22.87:1.5": "‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, and gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ ",
  "sn22.87:1.6": "And then say: ",

  "sn22.87:2.2": "Venerable Vakkali saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and stirred in his cot. ",
  "sn22.87:2.3": "But the Buddha said to him, ",

  "sn22.87:2.5": "There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.” ",
  "sn22.87:2.6": "He sat on the seat spread out and said to Vakkali, ",
  "sn22.87:2.7": "“I hope you’re keeping well, Vakkali; I hope you’re all right. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” ",

  "sn22.87:2.12": "“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” ",
  "sn22.87:2.13": "“In that case, Vakkali, why do you have remorse and regret?” ",
  "sn22.87:2.14": "“For a long time I’ve wanted to go and see the Buddha, but I was physically too weak.” ",
  "sn22.87:3.1": "“Enough, Vakkali! Why would you want to see this rotting body? ",

  "sn22.87:4.1": "What do you think, Vakkali? ",
  "sn22.87:4.2": "Is form permanent or impermanent?” ",
  "sn22.87:4.3": "“Impermanent, sir.” ",
  "sn22.87:4.4": "“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” ",
  "sn22.87:4.5": "“Suffering, sir.” ",
  "sn22.87:4.6": "“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ",

  "sn22.87:5.1": "And then, after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice, the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "sn22.87:5.2": "Then Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers, ",
  "sn22.87:5.3": "“Come on, reverends, lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. ",

  "sn22.87:5.5": "“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and did as he asked. ",
  "sn22.87:5.6": "Meanwhile, the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vulture’s Peak Mountain. ",
  "sn22.87:5.7": "Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. ",

  "sn22.87:5.12": "This is what those deities said. ",
  "sn22.87:5.13": "Then they bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there. ",
  "sn22.87:6.1": "Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ",
  "sn22.87:6.2": "“Come, mendicants, go to the mendicant Vakkali and tell him: ",
