  "sn41.3:4.13": "These views come to be when identity view exists. When identity view does not exist they do not come to be.” ",
  "sn41.3:5.1": "“But sir, how does identity view come about?” ",
  "sn41.3:5.2": "“It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
