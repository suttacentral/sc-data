  "sn41.3:1.6": "Then when the night had passed, the senior mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to Citta’s home, and sat down on the seats spread out. ",

  "sn41.3:2.2": "“Honorable Senior, there are many different views that arise in the world. For example: ",

  "sn41.3:4.12": "And also the sixty-two misconceptions spoken of in “The Divine Net”. ",
  "sn41.3:4.13": "These views come to be when substantialist view exists. When substantialist view does not exist they do not come to be.” ",
  "sn41.3:5.1": "“But sir, how does substantialist view come about?” ",
  "sn41.3:5.2": "“It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
