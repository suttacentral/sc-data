  "sn1.32:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "sn1.32:1.2": "Then, late at night, several glorious deities of the host of a hundred felicities, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. ",
  "sn1.32:1.3": "Standing to one side, one deity spoke this verse in the Buddha’s presence: ",
  "sn1.32:2.1": "“Because of stinginess and negligence ",
  "sn1.32:2.2": "a gift is not given. ",
  "sn1.32:2.3": "Wanting merit, ",
  "sn1.32:2.4": "a smart person would give.” ",
  "sn1.32:3.1": "Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: ",
  "sn1.32:4.1": "“When a miser fails to give because of fear, ",
  "sn1.32:4.2": "the very thing they’re afraid of comes to pass. ",
  "sn1.32:4.3": "The hunger and thirst ",
  "sn1.32:4.4": "that a miser fears ",
  "sn1.32:4.5": "hurt the fool ",
  "sn1.32:4.6": "in this world and the next. ",
  "sn1.32:5.1": "So you should dispel stinginess, ",
  "sn1.32:5.2": "overcoming that stain, and give a gift. ",
  "sn1.32:5.3": "The good deeds of sentient beings ",
  "sn1.32:5.4": "support them in the next world.” ",
  "sn1.32:6.1": "Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: ",
  "sn1.32:7.1": "“Among the dead they do not die, ",
  "sn1.32:7.2": "those who, like fellow travelers on the road, ",
  "sn1.32:7.3": "are happy to provide, though they have but little. ",
  "sn1.32:7.4": "This is an ancient teaching. ",
  "sn1.32:8.1": "Some who have little are happy to provide, ",
  "sn1.32:8.2": "while some who have much don’t wish to give. ",
  "sn1.32:8.3": "An offering given from little ",
  "sn1.32:8.4": "is multiplied a thousand times.” ",
  "sn1.32:9.1": "Then another deity recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: ",
  "sn1.32:10.1": "“Giving what’s hard to give, ",
  "sn1.32:10.2": "doing what’s hard to do; ",
  "sn1.32:10.3": "the wicked don’t act like this, ",
  "sn1.32:10.4": "for the teaching of the good is hard to follow. ",
  "sn1.32:11.1": "That’s why the virtuous and the wicked ",
  "sn1.32:11.2": "have different destinations after here. ",
  "sn1.32:11.3": "The wicked go to hell, ",
  "sn1.32:11.4": "while the virtuous are bound for heaven.” ",
  "sn1.32:12.1": "Then another deity said to the Buddha, ",
  "sn1.32:12.2": "“Sir, who has spoken well?” ",
  "sn1.32:13.1": "“You’ve all spoken well in your own way. However, listen to me also: ",
  "sn1.32:14.1": "A hundred thousand people <j>making a thousand sacrifices ",
  "sn1.32:14.2": "isn’t worth a fraction of that sort, ",
  "sn1.32:14.3": "who lives rightly, wandering for gleanings, ",
  "sn1.32:14.4": "or one who supports their partner <j>with what little they have.” ",
  "sn1.32:15.1": "Then another deity addressed the Buddha in verse: ",
  "sn1.32:16.1": "“Why doesn’t that sacrifice of theirs, so abundant and magnificent, ",
  "sn1.32:16.2": "equal the value of a moral person’s gift? ",
  "sn1.32:16.3": "How is it that a hundred thousand people  <j>making a thousand sacrifices ",

  "sn1.32:17.3": "Such an offering—tearful, violent—",
