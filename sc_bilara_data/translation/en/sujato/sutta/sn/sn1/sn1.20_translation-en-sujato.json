  "sn1.20:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Hot Springs Monastery. ",
  "sn1.20:1.3": "Then Venerable Samiddhi rose at the crack of dawn and went to the hot springs to bathe. ",
  "sn1.20:1.4": "When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs. ",
  "sn1.20:1.5": "Then, late at night, a glorious deity, lighting up the entire hot springs, went up to Samiddhi, and, standing in the air, addressed him in verse: ",
  "sn1.20:2.1": "“Mendicant, you seek alms before you eat; ",
  "sn1.20:2.2": "you don’t seek alms after eating. ",
  "sn1.20:2.3": "But you should eat first, then seek alms: ",

  "sn1.20:3.1": "“I actually don’t know the time; ",
  "sn1.20:3.2": "it’s hidden and unseen. ",

  "sn1.20:4.1": "Then that deity landed on the ground and said to Samiddhi, ",
  "sn1.20:4.2": "“You’ve gone forth while young, mendicant. With pristine black hair, you’re blessed with youth, in the prime of life, and you’ve never flirted with sensual pleasures. ",
  "sn1.20:4.3": "Enjoy human sensual pleasures! ",
  "sn1.20:4.4": "Don’t give up what is apparent in the present to chase after what takes effect over time.” ",

  "sn1.20:7.5": "And you should remember it in line with the Buddha’s answer.” ",
  "sn1.20:8.1": "“It’s not easy for us to approach the Buddha, as he is surrounded by other illustrious deities. ",
  "sn1.20:8.2": "If you go to the Buddha and ask him about this matter, we’ll come along and listen to the teaching.” ",
  "sn1.20:8.3": "“Yes, reverend,” Venerable Samiddhi replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. Then he added: ",
