  "sn47.43:1.5": "‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.",
  "sn47.43:2.1": "What four? ",
  "sn47.43:2.2": "A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",

  "sn47.43:3.3": "‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! ",
