  "sn56.41:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "sn56.41:1.2": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ",
  "sn56.41:1.3": "“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left Rājagaha, thinking ‘I’ll speculate about the world.’ They went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. ",
  "sn56.41:1.4": "Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. ",
  "sn56.41:1.5": "When he saw this he thought, ",
  "sn56.41:1.6": "‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! ",
  "sn56.41:1.7": "I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ ",
  "sn56.41:2.1": "Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd, ",
  "sn56.41:2.2": "‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! ",
  "sn56.41:2.3": "I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ ",
  "sn56.41:2.4": "‘But how is it that you’re mad? How have you lost your mind? ",
  "sn56.41:2.5": "And what have you seen that doesn’t exist in the world?’ ",
  "sn56.41:2.6": "‘Sirs, I left Rājagaha, thinking “I’ll speculate about the world.” I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. ",
  "sn56.41:2.7": "Then I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. ",
  "sn56.41:2.8": "That’s why I’m mad, that’s why I’ve lost my mind. ",
  "sn56.41:2.9": "And that’s what I’ve seen that doesn’t exist in the world.’ ",
  "sn56.41:2.10": "‘Well, mister, you’re definitely mad, you’ve definitely lost your mind. ",
  "sn56.41:2.11": "And you’re seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ ",
  "sn56.41:3.1": "But what that person saw was in fact real, not unreal. ",
  "sn56.41:3.2": "Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. ",
  "sn56.41:3.3": "In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. ",
  "sn56.41:3.4": "The defeated and terrified demons entered the demon city through the lotus stalk only to confuse the gods. ",
  "sn56.41:4.1": "So mendicants, don’t speculate about the world. ",
  "sn56.41:4.2": "For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. ",
  "sn56.41:4.3": "Why is that? ",
  "sn56.41:4.4": "Because those thoughts aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. ",
  "sn56.41:5.1": "When you think something up, you should think: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. ",
  "sn56.41:5.2": "Why is that? ",
  "sn56.41:5.3": "Because those thoughts are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. ",
  "sn56.41:6.1": "That’s why you should practice meditation …” "
