  "sn12.66:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "sn12.66:1.7": "“Mendicants, do you probe within?” ",
  "sn12.66:1.8": "When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, ",
  "sn12.66:1.9": "“Sir, I probe within.” ",
  "sn12.66:1.10": "“But mendicant, how do you probe within?” ",
  "sn12.66:1.11": "Then that mendicant answered, ",
  "sn12.66:1.12": "but the Buddha was not happy with the answer. ",
  "sn12.66:2.1": "When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, ",

  "sn12.66:3.1": "“Take a mendicant who probes within: ",
  "sn12.66:3.2": "‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. ",
  "sn12.66:3.3": "But what is the source of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ ",

  "sn12.66:3.5": "‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. ",
  "sn12.66:3.6": "The source of this suffering is attachment. When attachments exist old age and death come to be. And when attachments do not exist old age and death don’t come to be.’ ",
  "sn12.66:3.7": "They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. ",

  "sn12.66:5.1": "They probe further within: ",
  "sn12.66:5.2": "‘But where does that craving arise and where does it settle?’ ",

  "sn12.66:5.4": "‘That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant. ",
