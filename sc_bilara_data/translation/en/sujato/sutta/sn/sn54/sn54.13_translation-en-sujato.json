  "sn54.13:1.2": "Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: ",
  "sn54.13:1.3": "“Sir, is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?” ",

  "sn54.13:4.1": "And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? ",
  "sn54.13:4.2": "It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence. ",
  "sn54.13:4.3": "Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. ",
