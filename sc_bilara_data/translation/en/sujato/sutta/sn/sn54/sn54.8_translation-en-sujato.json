  "sn54.8:1.1": "“Mendicants, when immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. ",
  "sn54.8:1.2": "How so? ",
  "sn54.8:2.1": "It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence. ",
  "sn54.8:2.2": "Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. ",
  "sn54.8:2.3": "Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … ",
  "sn54.8:2.4": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ ",
  "sn54.8:2.5": "That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. ",
  "sn54.8:3.1": "Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too usually practiced this kind of meditation. ",
  "sn54.8:3.2": "And while I was usually practicing this kind of meditation neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. ",
  "sn54.8:3.3": "And my mind was freed from defilements by not grasping. ",
  "sn54.8:4.1": "Now, a mendicant might wish: ",
  "sn54.8:4.2": "‘May neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. And may my mind be freed from the defilements by not grasping.’ ",
  "sn54.8:4.3": "So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "sn54.8:5.1": "Now, a mendicant might wish: ",
  "sn54.8:5.2": "‘May I give up memories and thoughts tied to domestic life.’ ",

  "sn54.8:10.3": "So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "sn54.8:11.1": "Now, a mendicant might wish: ",
  "sn54.8:11.2": "‘Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, may I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ ",
  "sn54.8:11.3": "So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "sn54.8:12.1": "Now, a mendicant might wish: ",
  "sn54.8:12.2": "‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, may I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ ",
  "sn54.8:12.3": "So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "sn54.8:13.1": "Now, a mendicant might wish: ",
  "sn54.8:13.2": "‘With the fading away of rapture, may I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.”’ ",

  "sn54.8:15.1": "Now, a mendicant might wish: ",
  "sn54.8:15.2": "‘Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.’ ",

  "sn54.8:19.3": "So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. ",
  "sn54.8:20.1": "When immersion due to mindfulness of breathing has been developed and cultivated in this way, if they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. ",
  "sn54.8:20.2": "If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. ",
  "sn54.8:20.3": "If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. ",
