  "snp3.9:1.3": "Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included ",
  "snp3.9:1.4": "the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. ",
  "snp3.9:1.5": "Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question: ",
  "snp3.9:1.6": "“How do you become a brahmin?” ",
  "snp3.9:2.1": "Bhāradvāja said this: ",
  "snp3.9:2.2": "“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation—",
  "snp3.9:2.3": "then you’re a brahmin.” ",

  "snp3.9:3.2": "“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—",

  "snp3.9:3.4": "But neither was able to persuade the other. ",
  "snp3.9:4.1": "So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, ",
  "snp3.9:4.2": "“Worthy Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. ",

  "snp3.9:5.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, ",

  "snp3.9:8.6": "Oh Clear-eyed One, know this as our debate. ",
  "snp3.9:9.1": "Since neither of us was able ",
  "snp3.9:9.2": "to convince the other, ",
