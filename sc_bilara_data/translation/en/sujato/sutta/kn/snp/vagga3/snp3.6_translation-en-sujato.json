  "snp3.6:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "snp3.6:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "snp3.6:1.3": "Now at that time the wanderer Sabhiya had been presented with several questions by a deity who was a former blood relation, saying: ",
  "snp3.6:1.4": "“Sabhiya, you should live the spiritual life with whatever ascetic or brahmin answers these questions.” ",
  "snp3.6:2.1": "Then Sabhiya, after learning those questions in the presence of that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who led an order and a community, and taught a community, who were well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is, ",
  "snp3.6:2.2": "Pūraṇa Kassapa, the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla, Ajita of the hair blanket, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, and the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan. ",
  "snp3.6:2.3": "And he asked them those questions, ",
  "snp3.6:2.4": "but they were stumped by them. ",
  "snp3.6:2.5": "Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness, ",
  "snp3.6:2.6": "they questioned Sabhiya in return. ",
  "snp3.6:3.1": "Then Sabhiya thought, ",
  "snp3.6:3.2": "“Those famous ascetics and brahmins ",
  "snp3.6:3.4": "were stumped by my questions. ",
  "snp3.6:3.5": "Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness, ",
  "snp3.6:3.6": "they questioned me in return on that matter. ",
  "snp3.6:3.7": "Why don’t I return to a lesser life so I can enjoy sensual pleasures?” ",
  "snp3.6:4.1": "Then Sabhiya thought, ",
  "snp3.6:4.2": "“This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and tutors a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. ",
  "snp3.6:4.3": "Why don’t I ask him this question?” ",
  "snp3.6:5.1": "Then he thought, ",
  "snp3.6:5.2": "“Even those ascetics and brahmins who are elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; who are senior, long standing, long gone forth; who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community; who are well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people—that is ",
  "snp3.6:5.3": "Pūraṇa Kassapa and the rest—",
  "snp3.6:5.4": "were stumped by my questions. ",
  "snp3.6:5.5": "They displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness, and even questioned me in return. ",
  "snp3.6:5.6": "How can the ascetic Gotama possibly answer my questions, ",
  "snp3.6:5.7": "since he is so young in age and newly gone forth?” ",
  "snp3.6:6.1": "Then he thought, ",
  "snp3.6:6.2": "“An ascetic should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young. ",
  "snp3.6:6.3": "Though young, the ascetic Gotama has great psychic power and might. Why don’t I ask him this question?” ",
  "snp3.6:7.1": "Then Sabhiya set out for Rājagaha. ",
  "snp3.6:7.2": "Traveling stage by stage, he came to Rājagaha, the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "snp3.6:7.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, ",
  "snp3.6:7.4": "and addressed the Buddha in verse: ",
  "snp3.6:8.1": "“I’ve come full of  doubts and uncertainties,” ",
  "snp3.6:8.2": "said Sabhiya, ",
  "snp3.6:8.3": "“wishing to ask some questions. ",
  "snp3.6:8.4": "Please solve them for me. ",
  "snp3.6:8.5": "Answer my questions in turn, <j>in accordance with the truth.” ",
  "snp3.6:9.1": "“You have come from afar, Sabhiya,” ",
  "snp3.6:9.2": "said the Buddha, ",
  "snp3.6:9.3": "“wishing to ask some questions. ",
  "snp3.6:9.4": "I shall solve them for you, ",

  "snp3.6:10.1": "Ask me your question, Sabhiya, ",
  "snp3.6:10.2": "whatever you want. ",
  "snp3.6:10.3": "I’ll solve each and every ",
  "snp3.6:10.4": "question you have.” ",
  "snp3.6:11.1": "Then Sabhiya thought, ",
  "snp3.6:11.2": "“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! ",
  "snp3.6:11.3": "Where those other ascetics and brahmins didn’t even give me a chance, the Buddha has invited me.” ",
  "snp3.6:11.4": "Uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, he asked this question. ",
  "snp3.6:12.1": "“What must one attain to be called a mendicant?” ",
  "snp3.6:12.2": "said Sabhiya, ",
  "snp3.6:12.3": "“How is one ‘gentle’, how said to be ‘tamed’? ",

  "snp3.6:13.5": "their journey complete, their rebirths ended: <j>that is a mendicant. ",
  "snp3.6:14.1": "Equanimous towards everything, mindful, ",
  "snp3.6:14.2": "they don’t harm anyone in the world. ",
  "snp3.6:14.3": "An ascetic who has crossed over, unclouded, ",
  "snp3.6:14.4": "who has no pretensions, is gentle. ",

  "snp3.6:16.4": "the one they call ‘awakened’ has attained <j>the end of rebirth.” ",
  "snp3.6:17.1": "And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya asked another question: ",
  "snp3.6:18.1": "“What must one attain to be called ‘brahmin’?” ",
  "snp3.6:18.2": "said Sabhiya. ",
  "snp3.6:18.3": "“Why is one an ‘ascetic’, and how a ‘bathed initiate’? ",

  "snp3.6:22.3": "everywhere not stuck, freed: ",
  "snp3.6:22.4": "one such is rightly called ‘giant’.” ",
  "snp3.6:23.1": "And then Sabhiya asked another question: ",
