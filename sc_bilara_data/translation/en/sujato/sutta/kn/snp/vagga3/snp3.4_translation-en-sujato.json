  "snp3.4:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "snp3.4:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarikā river. ",
  "snp3.4:1.3": "Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā. ",
  "snp3.4:1.4": "Then he surveyed the four quarters, wondering, ",
  "snp3.4:1.5": "“Now who might eat the leftovers of this oblation?” ",
  "snp3.4:1.6": "He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. ",
  "snp3.4:1.7": "Taking the leftovers of the oblation in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. ",
  "snp3.4:2.1": "When he heard Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. ",
  "snp3.4:2.2": "Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. ",
  "snp3.4:2.3": "But he thought, ",
  "snp3.4:2.4": "“Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” ",
  "snp3.4:2.5": "Then the brahmin Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā went up to the Buddha, and said to him, ",
  "snp3.4:2.6": "“Sir, what are you by birth?” ",
  "snp3.4:3.1": "Then the Buddha addressed Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā in verse: ",
  "snp3.4:4.1": "“I am no brahmin, nor am I a ruler, ",
  "snp3.4:4.2": "nor peasant nor anything else. ",

  "snp3.4:5.2": "my hair shorn, quenched. ",
  "snp3.4:5.3": "Since I’m unburdened by the sons of Manu, ",
  "snp3.4:5.4": "it’s inappropriate to ask me about clan.” ",
  "snp3.4:6.1": "“Actually sir, when brahmins meet they politely ",
  "snp3.4:6.2": "ask each other whether they are brahmins.” ",
  "snp3.4:7.1": "“Well, if you say that you’re a brahmin, ",
  "snp3.4:7.2": "and that I am not, ",

  "snp3.4:8.2": "aristocrats and brahmins here in the world ",
  "snp3.4:8.3": "performed so many different sacrifices to the gods?” ",
  "snp3.4:9.1": "“During a sacrifice, should a past-master, <j>a knowledge master, ",
  "snp3.4:9.2": "receive an oblation, it profits the donor, I say.” ",
  "snp3.4:10.1": "“Then clearly my oblation will be profitable,” ",
  "snp3.4:10.2": "said the brahmin, ",
  "snp3.4:10.3": "“since I have met such a knowledge master. ",
  "snp3.4:10.4": "It’s because I’d never met anyone like you ",
  "snp3.4:10.5": "that others ate the sacrificial cake.” ",
  "snp3.4:11.1": "“So then, brahmin, since you have approached me ",
  "snp3.4:11.2": "as a seeker of the good, ask. ",
  "snp3.4:11.3": "Perhaps you may find here someone intelligent, ",
  "snp3.4:11.4": "peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, <j>with no need for hope.” ",
  "snp3.4:12.1": "“Worthy Gotama, I like to sacrifice ",
  "snp3.4:12.2": "and wish to perform a sacrifice. Please advise me, ",
  "snp3.4:12.3": "for I do not understand ",
  "snp3.4:12.4": "where an oblation is profitable; tell me this.” ",
  "snp3.4:13.1": "“Well then, brahmin, listen up, I will teach you the Dhamma. ",
  "snp3.4:14.1": "Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct; ",
  "snp3.4:14.2": "for the fire of Jātaveda is born from sticks. ",
