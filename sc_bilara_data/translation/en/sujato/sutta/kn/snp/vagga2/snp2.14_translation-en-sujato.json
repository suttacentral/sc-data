  "snp2.14:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "snp2.14:1.3": "Then the lay follower Dhammika, together with five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and addressed him in verse: ",
  "snp2.14:2.1": "“I ask you, Gotama, whose wisdom is vast: ",
  "snp2.14:2.2": "what does one do to become a good disciple, ",
  "snp2.14:2.3": "both one who has left the home, ",

  "snp2.14:15.2": "with anyone else, or with a mendicant, ",
  "snp2.14:15.3": "they’d bring up only the sublime teaching, ",
  "snp2.14:15.4": "not dividing or blaming. ",
  "snp2.14:16.1": "For some contend in debate, ",
