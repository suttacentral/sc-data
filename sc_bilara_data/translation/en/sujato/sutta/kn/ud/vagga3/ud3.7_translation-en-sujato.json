  "ud3.7:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "ud3.7:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "ud3.7:1.3": "Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying in the Pipphali cave. Having entered a certain state of immersion, he sat cross-legged for seven days without moving. ",
  "ud3.7:1.4": "When seven days had passed, Mahākassapa emerged from that state of immersion. ",
  "ud3.7:1.5": "It occurred to him, ",
  "ud3.7:1.6": "“Why not enter Rājagaha for almsfood?” ",
  "ud3.7:2.1": "Now at that time five hundred deities were ready and eager for the chance to offer alms to Mahākassapa. ",
  "ud3.7:2.2": "But Mahākasspa refused those deities. In the morning, he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms. ",
  "ud3.7:2.3": "Now at that time Sakka, lord of Gods, wished to give alms to Mahākassapa. ",
  "ud3.7:3.2": "Having manifested in the appearance of a weaver, he worked the loom while the demon maiden Sujā fed the shuttle. ",
  "ud3.7:3.3": "Then, as Mahākassapa wandered indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha, he approached Sakka’s house. ",
  "ud3.7:3.4": "Seeing Mahākassapa coming off in the distance, ",
  "ud3.7:3.5": "Sakka came out of his house, greeted him, and took the bowl from his hand. He re-entered the house and filled the bowl with rice from the pot. ",
  "ud3.7:3.6": "That almsfood had many tasty soups and sauces. ",
  "ud3.7:3.7": "Then it occurred to Mahākassapa, ",
  "ud3.7:3.8": "“Now, what being is this who has such psychic power?” ",
  "ud3.7:3.9": "It occurred to him, ",
  "ud3.7:3.10": "“This is Sakka, lord of Gods.” ",
  "ud3.7:3.11": "Knowing this, he said to Sakka, ",
  "ud3.7:3.12": "“This is your doing, Kosiya; ",
  "ud3.7:3.13": "don’t do such a thing again.” ",
  "ud3.7:3.14": "“But sir, Kassapa, we too need merit! ",
  "ud3.7:3.15": "We too ought make merit.” ",
  "ud3.7:4.1": "Then Sakka bowed and respectfully circled Mahākassapa, keeping him on his right. Then he rose into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: ",
  "ud3.7:4.2": "“Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa! ",
  "ud3.7:4.3": "Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa! ",
  "ud3.7:4.4": "Oh the gift, the best gift is well established in Kassapa!” ",
  "ud3.7:4.5": "With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard Sakka express this heartfelt sentiment while sitting in the sky. ",
  "ud3.7:5.1": "Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: ",
  "ud3.7:6.1": "“A mendicant who relies on alms, ",
  "ud3.7:6.2": "self-supported, providing for no other; ",
  "ud3.7:6.3": "the poised one is envied by even the gods, ",
  "ud3.7:6.4": "calm and ever mindful.” "
