  "ud8.6:14.1": "The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a Dhamma talk. Then he sent them off, ",

  "ud8.6:17.11": "from fire, flood, and dissension.” ",
  "ud8.6:18.1": "Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "ud8.6:18.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said, ",
  "ud8.6:18.4": "“Would the worthy Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?” ",

  "ud8.6:19.2": "“It’s time, worthy Gotama, the meal is ready.” ",
  "ud8.6:20.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to their guest house together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. ",
  "ud8.6:20.2": "Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. ",
  "ud8.6:21.1": "When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat and sat to one side. ",

  "ud8.6:23.3": "Venerated, they venerate him; ",
  "ud8.6:23.4": "honored, they honor him. ",
  "ud8.6:24.1": "After that they have sympathy for him, ",
  "ud8.6:24.2": "like a mother for the child at her breast. ",
  "ud8.6:24.3": "A man beloved of the deities ",
  "ud8.6:24.4": "always sees nice things.” ",
  "ud8.6:25.1": "When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses, he got up from his seat and left. ",
  "ud8.6:26.1": "Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha, thinking, ",
  "ud8.6:26.2": "“The gate through which the ascetic Gotama exits today shall be named the Gotama Gate. ",
  "ud8.6:26.3": "The ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be named the Gotama Ford.” ",
  "ud8.6:27.1": "Then the gate through which the Buddha exited was named the Gotama Gate. ",
  "ud8.6:27.2": "Then the Buddha came to the Ganges River. ",
  "ud8.6:27.3": "Now at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. ",
  "ud8.6:27.4": "Wanting to cross from the near to the far shore, some people were seeking a boat, some a dinghy, while some were tying up a raft. ",
  "ud8.6:27.5": "But, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shore. ",
  "ud8.6:28.1": "He saw all those humans wanting to cross over. ",
  "ud8.6:29.1": "Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: ",
  "ud8.6:30.1": "“Those who cross a deluge or stream ",
  "ud8.6:30.2": "have built a bridge and left the marshes behind. ",
  "ud8.6:30.3": "While some people are still tying a raft, ",
  "ud8.6:30.4": "intelligent people have crossed over.” "
