  "mn85:0.2": "With Prince Bodhi ",
  "mn85:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn85:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. ",
  "mn85:2.1": "Now at that time a new stilt longhouse named Pink Lotus had recently been constructed for Prince Bodhi. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. ",
  "mn85:3.1": "Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahmin student Sañjikāputta, ",
  "mn85:3.2": "“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",
  "mn85:3.3": "",
  "mn85:3.4": "And then ask him whether he ",
  "mn85:3.5": "might accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the mendicant Saṅgha.” ",
  "mn85:4.1": "“Yes, sir,” Sañjikāputta replied. He did as Prince Bodhi asked, and ",
  "mn85:4.2": "",
  "mn85:4.3": "",
  "mn85:4.4": "",
  "mn85:4.5": "",
  "mn85:4.6": "the Buddha consented in silence. ",
  "mn85:4.7": "Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañjikāputta got up from his seat, went to Prince Bodhi, and said, ",
  "mn85:4.8": "“I gave the ascetic Gotama your message, ",
  "mn85:4.9": "",
  "mn85:4.10": "",
  "mn85:4.11": "",
  "mn85:4.12": "and he accepted.” ",
  "mn85:5.1": "And when the night had passed Prince Bodhi had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. He also had the Pink Lotus longhouse spread with white cloth down to the last step of the staircase. Then he said to Sañjikāputta, ",
  "mn85:5.2": "“Please, dear Sañjikāputta, go to the Buddha, and announce the time, saying, ",
  "mn85:5.3": "‘Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.’” ",
  "mn85:5.4": "“Yes, sir,” Sañjikāputta replied, and he did as he was asked. ",
  "mn85:5.5": "",
  "mn85:6.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Prince Bodhi’s home. ",
  "mn85:7.1": "Now at that time Prince Bodhi was standing outside the gates waiting for the Buddha. ",
  "mn85:7.2": "Seeing the Buddha coming off in the distance, ",
  "mn85:7.3": "he went out to greet him. After bowing and inviting the Buddha to go first, he approached the Pink Lotus longhouse. ",
  "mn85:7.4": "But the Buddha stopped by the last step of the staircase. ",
  "mn85:7.5": "Then Prince Bodhi said to him, ",
  "mn85:7.6": "“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth! ",
  "mn85:7.7": "It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” ",
  "mn85:7.8": "But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. ",
  "mn85:7.9": "For a second time … ",
  "mn85:7.10": "and a third time, Prince Bodhi said to him, ",
  "mn85:7.11": "“Sir, let the Blessed One ascend on the cloth! Let the Holy One ascend on the cloth! ",
  "mn85:7.12": "It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” ",
  "mn85:7.13": "Then the Buddha glanced at Venerable Ānanda. ",
  "mn85:7.14": "So Ānanda said to Prince Bodhi, ",
  "mn85:7.15": "“Fold up the cloth, Prince. ",
  "mn85:7.16": "The Buddha will not step upon white cloth. ",
  "mn85:7.17": "The Realized One has compassion for future generations.” ",
  "mn85:8.1": "So Prince Bodhi had the cloth folded up and the seats spread out upstairs in the longhouse. ",
  "mn85:8.2": "Then the Buddha ascended the longhouse and sat on the seats spread out together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. ",
  "mn85:9.1": "Then Prince Bodhi served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. ",
  "mn85:9.2": "When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Prince Bodhi took a low seat, sat to one side, ",
  "mn85:9.3": "and said to him, ",
  "mn85:9.4": "“Sir, this is what I think: ",
  "mn85:9.5": "‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’” ",
  "mn85:10.1": "“Prince, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought: ",
  "mn85:10.2": "‘Pleasure is not gained through pleasure; pleasure is gained through pain.’ ",
  "mn85:11.1": "Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn85:11.2": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn85:11.3": "‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ ",
  "mn85:11.4": "Āḷāra Kālāma replied, ",
  "mn85:11.5": "‘Stay, venerable. ",
  "mn85:11.6": "This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn85:11.7": "I quickly memorized that teaching. ",
  "mn85:11.8": "So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others. ",
  "mn85:11.9": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:11.10": "‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.” ",
  "mn85:11.11": "Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’ ",
  "mn85:12.1": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn85:12.2": "‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’ ",
  "mn85:12.3": "When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness. ",
  "mn85:12.4": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:12.5": "‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith, ",
  "mn85:12.6": "energy, ",
  "mn85:12.7": "mindfulness, ",
  "mn85:12.8": "immersion, ",
  "mn85:12.9": "and wisdom; I too have these things. ",
  "mn85:12.10": "Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’ ",
  "mn85:12.11": "I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it. ",
  "mn85:12.12": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn85:12.13": "‘Reverend Kālāma, have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point, and declare having achieved it?’ ",
  "mn85:12.14": "‘I have, reverend.’ ",
  "mn85:12.15": "‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn85:12.16": "‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate ",
  "mn85:12.17": "to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions! ",
  "mn85:12.18": "So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it. ",
  "mn85:12.19": "The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it. ",
  "mn85:12.20": "So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know. ",
  "mn85:12.21": "I am like you and you are like me. ",
  "mn85:12.22": "Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’ ",
  "mn85:12.23": "And that is how my teacher Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his student, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise. ",
  "mn85:12.24": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:12.25": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’ ",
  "mn85:12.26": "Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. ",
  "mn85:12.27": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him, ",
  "mn85:12.28": "‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ ",
  "mn85:12.29": "Uddaka replied, ",
  "mn85:12.30": "‘Stay, venerable. ",
  "mn85:12.31": "This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ ",

  "mn85:13.3": "When I said this, Uddaka, son of Rāma, declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. ",
  "mn85:13.4": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:13.5": "‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith, ",
  "mn85:13.6": "energy, ",
  "mn85:13.7": "mindfulness, ",

  "mn85:13.19": "The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it. ",
  "mn85:13.20": "So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew. ",
  "mn85:13.21": "Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma. ",
  "mn85:13.22": "Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’ ",
  "mn85:13.23": "And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka, son of Rāma, placed me in the position of a teacher, and honored me with lofty praise. ",

  "mn85:13.26": "Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. ",
  "mn85:14.1": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā. ",
  "mn85:14.2": "There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village for alms. ",
  "mn85:14.3": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:14.4": "‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village for alms. ",
  "mn85:14.5": "This is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditation.’ ",
  "mn85:14.6": "So I sat down right there, thinking, ",
  "mn85:14.7": "‘This is good enough for meditation.’ ",
  "mn85:15.1": "And then these three examples, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me. ",
  "mn85:16.1": "Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water. ",
  "mn85:16.2": "Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking ",
  "mn85:16.3": "to light a fire and produce heat. ",
  "mn85:16.4": "What do you think, Prince? ",
  "mn85:16.5": "By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in water, could they light a fire and produce heat?” ",
  "mn85:16.6": "“No, sir. ",
  "mn85:16.7": "Why is that? ",
  "mn85:16.8": "Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water. ",
  "mn85:16.9": "That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.” ",
  "mn85:17.1": "“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings because of their efforts, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening. ",
  "mn85:17.2": "",
  "mn85:17.3": "",
  "mn85:17.4": "This was the first example that occurred to me. ",
  "mn85:18.1": "Then a second example occurred to me. ",
  "mn85:18.2": "Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water. ",
  "mn85:18.3": "Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking ",
  "mn85:18.4": "to light a fire and produce heat. ",

  "mn85:18.7": "“No, sir. ",
  "mn85:18.8": "Why is that? ",
  "mn85:18.9": "Because it’s still a green, sappy log, despite the fact that it’s lying on dry land far from water. ",

  "mn85:20.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:20.2": "‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and torture mind with mind.’ ",
  "mn85:20.3": "So that’s what I did, ",
  "mn85:20.4": "until sweat ran from my armpits. ",
  "mn85:20.5": "It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and tortures them. ",
  "mn85:20.6": "In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and tortured mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits. ",
  "mn85:20.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",
  "mn85:21.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:21.2": "‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’ ",
  "mn85:21.3": "So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose. ",
  "mn85:21.4": "But then winds came out my ears making a loud noise, ",
  "mn85:21.5": "like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows. ",
  "mn85:21.6": "",
  "mn85:21.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",
  "mn85:22.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:22.2": "‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’ ",
  "mn85:22.3": "So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears. ",
  "mn85:22.4": "But then strong winds ground my head, ",
  "mn85:22.5": "like a strong man was drilling into my head with a sharp point. ",
  "mn85:22.6": "",
  "mn85:22.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",
  "mn85:23.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:23.2": "‘Why don’t I keep practicing the breathless absorption?’ ",
  "mn85:23.3": "So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears. ",
  "mn85:23.4": "But then I got a severe headache, ",
  "mn85:23.5": "like a strong man was tightening a tough leather strap around my head. ",
  "mn85:23.6": "",
  "mn85:23.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",

  "mn85:24.4": "But then strong winds carved up my belly, ",
  "mn85:24.5": "like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a meat cleaver. ",
  "mn85:24.6": "",
  "mn85:24.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",

  "mn85:25.3": "So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose and ears. ",
  "mn85:25.4": "But then there was an intense burning in my body, ",
  "mn85:25.5": "like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. ",
  "mn85:25.6": "",
  "mn85:25.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",
  "mn85:26.1": "Then some deities saw me and said, ",
  "mn85:26.2": "‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’ ",
  "mn85:26.3": "Others said, ",
  "mn85:26.4": "‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’ ",
  "mn85:26.5": "Others said, ",
  "mn85:26.6": "‘He’s not dead or dying. The ascetic Gotama is a perfected one, for that is how the perfected ones live.’ ",
  "mn85:27.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:27.2": "‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’ ",
  "mn85:27.3": "But deities came to me and said, ",
  "mn85:27.4": "‘Good sir, don’t practice totally cutting off food. ",
  "mn85:27.5": "If you do, we’ll infuse divine nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’ ",
  "mn85:27.6": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:27.7": "‘If I claim to be completely fasting while these deities are infusing divine nectar in my pores, that would be a lie on my part.’ ",
  "mn85:27.8": "So I dismissed those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’ ",
  "mn85:28.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:28.2": "‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a cup of broth made from mung beans, lentils, chickpeas, or green gram.’ ",
  "mn85:28.3": "So that’s what I did, ",
  "mn85:28.4": "until my body became extremely emaciated. ",
  "mn85:28.5": "Due to eating so little, my limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a corpse, ",
  "mn85:28.6": "my bottom became like a camel’s hoof, ",
  "mn85:28.7": "my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string, ",
  "mn85:28.8": "and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn. ",
  "mn85:28.9": "Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well. ",
  "mn85:28.10": "Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun. ",
  "mn85:28.11": "Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly. ",
  "mn85:28.12": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there. ",
  "mn85:28.13": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out. ",
  "mn85:29.1": "Then some people saw me and said, ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’ ",
  "mn85:29.2": "Some said, ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’ ",
  "mn85:29.3": "Some said, ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has tawny skin.’ ",
  "mn85:29.4": "That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food. ",
  "mn85:30.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:30.2": "‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this. ",
  "mn85:30.3": "",
  "mn85:30.4": "",
  "mn85:30.5": "But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, gruelling work. ",
  "mn85:30.6": "Could there be another path to awakening?’ ",
  "mn85:31.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:31.2": "‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of the rose-apple tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn85:31.3": "Could that be the path to awakening?’ ",
  "mn85:31.4": "Stemming from that memory came the realization: ",
  "mn85:31.5": "‘<em>That</em> is the path to awakening!’ ",
  "mn85:32.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:32.2": "‘Why am I afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities?’ ",
  "mn85:32.3": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:32.4": "‘I’m not afraid of that pleasure, for it has nothing to do with sensual pleasures or unskillful qualities.’ ",
  "mn85:33.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:33.2": "‘I can’t achieve that pleasure with a body so excessively emaciated. Why don’t I eat some solid food, some rice and porridge?’ ",
  "mn85:33.3": "So I ate some solid food. ",
  "mn85:33.4": "Now at that time the five mendicants were attending on me, thinking, ",
  "mn85:33.5": "‘The ascetic Gotama will tell us of any truth that he realizes.’ ",
  "mn85:33.6": "But when I ate some solid food, they left disappointed in me, saying, ",

  "mn85:34-37.1": "After eating solid food and gathering my strength, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption … ",

  "mn85:34-37.3": "third absorption … ",
  "mn85:34-37.4": "fourth absorption. ",
  "mn85:34-37.5": "When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives. ",
  "mn85:34-37.6": "I recollected many past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details. ",
  "mn85:34-37.7": "This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night. ",
  "mn85:34-37.8": "Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. ",
  "mn85:38.1": "When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. ",
  "mn85:38.2": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ",
  "mn85:39.1": "This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. ",
  "mn85:40.1": "When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. ",
  "mn85:40.2": "I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. ",

  "mn85:41.1": "Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. ",
  "mn85:41.2": "When it was freed, I knew it was freed. ",
  "mn85:41.3": "I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’ ",
  "mn85:42.1": "This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night. ",
  "mn85:42.2": "Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. ",
  "mn85:43.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:43.2": "‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. ",
  "mn85:43.3": "But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. ",
  "mn85:43.4": "It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. ",
  "mn85:43.5": "It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. ",
  "mn85:43.6": "And if I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’ ",
  "mn85:43.7": "And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me: ",
  "mn85:43.8": "‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this, ",
  "mn85:43.9": "enough with trying to explain it! ",
  "mn85:43.10": "This teaching is not easily understood ",
  "mn85:43.11": "by those mired in greed and hate. ",
  "mn85:43.12": "Those besotted by greed can’t see ",
  "mn85:43.13": "what’s subtle, going against the stream, ",
  "mn85:43.14": "deep, hard to see, and very fine, ",
  "mn85:43.15": "for they’re veiled in a mass of darkness.’ ",
  "mn85:43.16": "And as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. ",
  "mn85:44.1": "Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, thought, ",
  "mn85:44.2": "‘Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’ ",
  "mn85:44.3": "Then Brahmā Sahampati, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me. ",
  "mn85:44.4": "He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said, ",
  "mn85:44.5": "‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! ",
  "mn85:44.6": "There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. ",
  "mn85:44.7": "There will be those who understand the teaching!’ ",
  "mn85:44.8": "That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. ",
  "mn85:44.9": "Then he went on to say: ",
  "mn85:44.10": "‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past ",
  "mn85:44.11": "an impure teaching thought up by those still stained. ",
  "mn85:44.12": "Fling open the door to the deathless! ",
  "mn85:44.13": "Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered. ",
  "mn85:44.14": "Standing high on a rocky mountain, ",
  "mn85:44.15": "you can see the people all around. ",
  "mn85:44.16": "In just the same way, all-seer, wise one, ",
  "mn85:44.17": "having ascended the Temple of Truth, ",
  "mn85:44.18": "rid of sorrow, look upon the people ",
  "mn85:44.19": "swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age. ",
  "mn85:44.20": "Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, ",

  "mn85:44.22": "Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! ",
  "mn85:44.23": "There will be those who understand!’ ",
  "mn85:45.1": "Then, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings. ",
  "mn85:45.2": "And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. ",
  "mn85:45.3": "It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. ",
  "mn85:45.4": "",
  "mn85:45.5": "Then I replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati: ",
  "mn85:45.6": "‘Flung open are the doors to the deathless! ",
  "mn85:45.7": "Let those with ears to hear commit to faith. ",
  "mn85:45.8": "Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, <j>I did not teach ",
  "mn85:45.9": "the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.’ ",
  "mn85:45.10": "Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there. ",
  "mn85:46.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn85:46.2": "‘Who should I teach first of all? ",
  "mn85:46.3": "Who will quickly understand the teaching?’ ",

  "mn85:49.2": "While I was traveling along the road between Gayā and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me ",
  "mn85:49.3": "and said, ",
