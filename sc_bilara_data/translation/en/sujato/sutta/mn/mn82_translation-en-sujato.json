  "mn82:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn82:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhika. ",
  "mn82:2.1": "The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika heard: ",
  "mn82:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. ",
  "mn82:2.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "mn82:2.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "mn82:2.5": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn82:2.6": "He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "mn82:2.7": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "mn82:3.1": "Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. ",
  "mn82:3.2": "When they were seated, the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. ",
  "mn82:4.1": "Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhika, was sitting in the assembly. ",
  "mn82:4.2": "He thought, ",
  "mn82:4.3": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "mn82:4.4": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?” ",
  "mn82:5.1": "Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhika got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. ",
  "mn82:6.1": "Soon after they left, Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
  "mn82:6.2": "“Sir, as I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "mn82:6.3": "I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn82:6.4": "Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence? ",
  "mn82:6.5": "May the Buddha please give me the going forth!” ",
  "mn82:6.6": "“But, Raṭṭhapāla, do you have your parents’ permission?” ",
  "mn82:6.7": "“No, sir.” ",
  "mn82:6.8": "“Raṭṭhapāla, Buddhas don’t give the going forth to the child of parents who haven’t given their permission.” ",
  "mn82:6.9": "“I’ll make sure, sir, to get my parents’ permission.” ",
  "mn82:7.1": "Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha. Then he went to his parents and said, ",
  "mn82:7.2": "“Mum and dad, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "mn82:7.3": "I wish to shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn82:7.4": "Please give me permission to go forth.” ",
  "mn82:7.5": "When he said this, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him, ",
  "mn82:7.6": "“But, dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort. ",
  "mn82:7.7": "You know nothing of suffering. ",
  "mn82:7.8": "Even when you die we will lose you against our wishes. ",
  "mn82:7.9": "So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?” ",
  "mn82:7.10": "For a second time, ",

  "mn82:13.4": "where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn82:14.1": "Then Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn82:14.2": "He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.” ",

  "mn82:16.3": "where he stayed in King Koravya’s deer range. ",
  "mn82:16.4": "Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Thullakoṭṭhika for alms. ",
  "mn82:16.5": "Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood, he approached his own father’s house. ",
  "mn82:17.1": "Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla’s father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gate. ",
  "mn82:17.2": "He saw Raṭṭhapāla coming off in the distance ",

  "mn82:17.4": "“Our dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings, these fake ascetics!” ",

  "mn82:18.1": "Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous night’s porridge. ",
  "mn82:18.2": "So Raṭṭhapāla said to her, ",
  "mn82:18.3": "“If that’s to be thrown away, sister, pour it here in my bowl.” ",
  "mn82:18.4": "As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl, she recognized the features of his hands, feet, and voice. ",
  "mn82:18.5": "She then went to his mother and said, ",
  "mn82:18.6": "“Please, madam, you should know this. ",
  "mn82:18.7": "Master Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.” ",
  "mn82:18.8": "“If you speak the truth, wench, I’ll make you a free woman!” ",
  "mn82:18.9": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s mother went to his father and said, ",
  "mn82:18.10": "“Please householder, you should know this. ",
  "mn82:18.11": "It seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.” ",
  "mn82:19.1": "Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last night’s porridge by a wall. ",
  "mn82:19.2": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father went up to him and said, ",
  "mn82:19.3": "“Dear Raṭṭhapāla! How can you be eating last night’s porridge? ",
  "mn82:19.4": "Why not go to your own home?” ",
  "mn82:19.5": "“Householder, how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house? ",
  "mn82:19.6": "We are homeless, householder. ",
  "mn82:19.7": "I came to your house, but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal, ",
  "mn82:19.8": "but only abuse.” ",
  "mn82:19.9": "“Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla, let’s go to the house.” ",
  "mn82:19.10": "“Enough, householder. My meal is finished for today.” ",
  "mn82:19.11": "“Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” ",
  "mn82:19.12": "Raṭṭhapāla consented with silence. ",
  "mn82:20.1": "Then, knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented, his father went back to his own house. He made a heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, and hid it under mats. Then he addressed Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives, ",
  "mn82:20.2": "“Please, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorable.” ",
  "mn82:21.1": "And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapāla’s father had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home, and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying, ",
  "mn82:21.2": "“Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” ",
  "mn82:22.1": "Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to his father’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out. Raṭṭhapāla’s father, revealing the heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, said to him, ",
  "mn82:22.2": "“Dear Raṭṭhapāla, this is your maternal fortune. There’s another paternal fortune, and an ancestral one. ",
  "mn82:22.3": "You can both enjoy your wealth and make merit. ",
  "mn82:22.4": "Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!” ",
  "mn82:22.5": "“If you’d follow my advice, householder, you’d have this heap of gold, both coined and uncoined, loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges river. ",
  "mn82:22.6": "Why is that? ",
  "mn82:22.7": "Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.” ",
  "mn82:23.1": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives each clasped his feet and said, ",
  "mn82:23.2": "“What are they like, master, the nymphs for whom you lead the spiritual life?” ",
  "mn82:23.3": "“Sisters, I don’t lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.” ",
  "mn82:23.4": "Saying, “Our master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us as sisters!” they fainted right away. ",
  "mn82:24.1": "Then Raṭṭhapāla said to his father, ",
  "mn82:24.2": "“If there is food to be given, householder, please give it. ",
  "mn82:24.3": "But don’t harass me.” ",
  "mn82:24.4": "“Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla. The meal is ready.” ",
  "mn82:24.5": "Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father served and satisfied Venerable Raṭṭhapāla with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. ",
  "mn82:24.6": "When he had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, he spoke this verse while standing right there: ",
  "mn82:25.1": "“See this fancy puppet, ",
  "mn82:25.2": "a body built of sores, ",
  "mn82:25.3": "diseased, obsessed over, ",
  "mn82:25.4": "in which nothing lasts at all. ",
  "mn82:25.5": "See this fancy figure, ",
  "mn82:25.6": "with its gems and earrings; ",
  "mn82:25.7": "it is bones encased in skin, ",
  "mn82:25.8": "made pretty by its clothes. ",
  "mn82:25.9": "Rouged feet ",
  "mn82:25.10": "and powdered face ",
  "mn82:25.11": "may be enough to beguile a fool, ",
  "mn82:25.12": "but not a seeker of the far shore. ",
  "mn82:25.13": "Hair in eight braids ",
  "mn82:25.14": "and eyeshadow ",
  "mn82:25.15": "may be enough to beguile a fool, ",
  "mn82:25.16": "but not a seeker of the far shore. ",
  "mn82:25.17": "A rotting body all adorned ",
  "mn82:25.18": "like a freshly painted makeup box ",
  "mn82:25.19": "may be enough to beguile a fool, ",
  "mn82:25.20": "but not a seeker of the far shore. ",
  "mn82:25.21": "The hunter laid his snare, ",
  "mn82:25.22": "but the deer didn’t spring the trap. ",
  "mn82:25.23": "I’ve eaten the bait and now I go, ",
  "mn82:25.24": "leaving the trapper to lament.” ",
  "mn82:26.1": "Then Raṭṭhapāla, having spoke this verse while standing, went to King Koravya’s deer range and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. ",
  "mn82:27.1": "Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper, ",
  "mn82:27.2": "“My good gamekeeper, tidy up the park of the deer range. ",
  "mn82:27.3": "We will go to see the scenery.” ",
  "mn82:27.4": "“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied the gamekeeper. While tidying the deer range he saw Raṭṭhapāla sitting in meditation. ",
  "mn82:27.5": "Seeing this, he went to the king, and said, ",
  "mn82:27.6": "“The deer range is tidy, sire. ",
  "mn82:27.7": "And the gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhika, of whom you have often spoken highly, is meditating there at the root of a tree.” ",
  "mn82:27.8": "“Well then, my good gamekeeper, that’s enough of the park for today. ",
  "mn82:27.9": "Now I shall pay homage to the worthy Raṭṭhapāla.” ",
  "mn82:28.1": "And then King Koravya said, “Give away the fresh and cooked foods that have been prepared there.” He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Thullakoṭṭhika to see Raṭṭhapāla. ",
  "mn82:28.2": "He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Raṭṭhapāla on foot, together with a group of eminent officials. They exchanged greetings, and, when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side and said to Raṭṭhapāla: ",
  "mn82:28.3": "“Here, worthy Raṭṭhapāla, sit on this elephant rug.” ",
  "mn82:28.4": "“Enough, great king, you sit on it. ",
  "mn82:28.5": "I’m sitting on my own seat.” ",
  "mn82:28.6": "So the king sat down on the seat spread out, and said: ",
  "mn82:29.1": "“Worthy Raṭṭhapāla, there are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn82:29.2": "What four? ",
  "mn82:29.3": "Decay due to old age, decay due to sickness, decay of wealth, and decay of relatives. ",
  "mn82:30.1": "And what is decay due to old age? ",
  "mn82:30.2": "It’s when someone is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life. ",
  "mn82:30.3": "They reflect: ",
  "mn82:30.4": "‘I’m now old, elderly, and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. ",
  "mn82:30.5": "It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired. ",
  "mn82:30.6": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "mn82:30.7": "So because of that decay due to old age they go forth. ",
  "mn82:30.8": "This is called decay due to old age. ",
  "mn82:30.9": "But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is now a youth, young, with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. ",
  "mn82:30.10": "You have no decay due to old age. ",
  "mn82:30.11": "So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth? ",
  "mn82:31.1": "And what is decay due to sickness? ",
  "mn82:31.2": "It’s when someone is sick, suffering, gravely ill. ",
  "mn82:31.3": "They reflect: ",

  "mn82:31.5": "It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired. ",
  "mn82:31.6": "Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "mn82:31.7": "So because of that decay due to sickness they go forth. ",
  "mn82:31.8": "This is called decay due to sickness. ",
  "mn82:31.9": "But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is now rarely ill or unwell. Your stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold. ",
  "mn82:31.10": "You have no decay due to sickness. ",
  "mn82:31.11": "So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth? ",
  "mn82:32.1": "And what is decay of wealth? ",
  "mn82:32.2": "It’s when someone is rich, affluent, and wealthy. ",
  "mn82:32.3": "But gradually their wealth dwindles away. ",
  "mn82:32.4": "They reflect: ",
  "mn82:32.5": "‘I used to be rich, affluent, and wealthy. ",
  "mn82:32.6": "But gradually my wealth has dwindled away. ",
  "mn82:32.7": "It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired. ",
  "mn82:32.8": "Why don’t I go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "mn82:32.9": "So because of that decay of wealth they go forth. ",
  "mn82:32.10": "This is called decay of wealth. ",
  "mn82:32.11": "But worthy Raṭṭhapāla is the son of the leading clan here in Thullakoṭṭhika. ",
  "mn82:32.12": "You have no decay of wealth. ",
  "mn82:32.13": "So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth? ",
  "mn82:33.1": "And what is decay of relatives? ",
  "mn82:33.2": "It’s when someone has many friends and colleagues, relatives and kin. ",
  "mn82:33.3": "But gradually their relatives dwindle away. ",
  "mn82:33.4": "They reflect: ",

  "mn82:33.9": "So because of that decay of relatives they go forth. ",
  "mn82:33.10": "This is called decay of relatives. ",
