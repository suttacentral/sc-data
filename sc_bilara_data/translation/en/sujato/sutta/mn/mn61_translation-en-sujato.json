  "mn61:0.2": "Advice to Rāhula at Ambalaṭṭhika ",
  "mn61:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn61:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "mn61:2.1": "Now at that time Venerable Rāhula was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. ",
  "mn61:2.2": "Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Ambalaṭṭhika to see Venerable Rāhula. ",
  "mn61:2.3": "Rāhula saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. ",
  "mn61:2.4": "He spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet. ",
  "mn61:2.5": "The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, ",
  "mn61:2.6": "and washed his feet. ",
  "mn61:2.7": "Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. ",
  "mn61:3.1": "Then the Buddha, leaving a little water in the pot, addressed Rāhula, ",
  "mn61:3.2": "“Rāhula, do you see this little bit of water left in the pot?” ",
  "mn61:3.3": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn61:3.4": "“That’s how little of the ascetic’s nature is left in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.” ",
  "mn61:4.1": "Then the Buddha, discarding what little water was left in the pot, said to Rāhula, ",
  "mn61:4.2": "“Do you see this little bit of water that was discarded?” ",
  "mn61:4.3": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn61:4.4": "“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is discarded in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.” ",
  "mn61:5.1": "Then the Buddha, turning the pot upside down, said to Rāhula, ",
  "mn61:5.2": "“Do you see how this pot is turned upside down?” ",
  "mn61:5.3": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn61:5.4": "“That’s how the ascetic’s nature is turned upside down in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie.” ",
  "mn61:6.1": "Then the Buddha, turning the pot right side up, said to Rāhula, ",
  "mn61:6.2": "“Do you see how this pot is vacant and hollow?” ",
  "mn61:6.3": "“Yes, sir.” ",
  "mn61:6.4": "“That’s how vacant and hollow the ascetic’s nature is in those who are not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie. ",
  "mn61:7.1": "Suppose there was a royal bull elephant with tusks like chariot-poles, able to draw a heavy load, pedigree and battle-hardened. In battle it uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, but it still protects its trunk. ",
  "mn61:7.2": "So its rider thinks: ",
  "mn61:7.3": "‘This royal bull elephant still protects its trunk. ",
  "mn61:7.4": "It has not yet given its life.’ ",
  "mn61:7.5": "But when that royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk, its rider thinks: ",
  "mn61:7.6": "‘This royal bull elephant … in battle uses its fore-feet and hind-feet, its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its head, ears, tusks, and tail, and its trunk. ",
  "mn61:7.7": "It has given its life. ",
  "mn61:7.8": "Now there is nothing that royal bull elephant would not do.’ ",
  "mn61:7.9": "In the same way, when someone is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie, there is no bad deed they would not do, I say. ",
  "mn61:7.10": "So you should train like this: ‘I will not tell a lie, even for a joke.’ ",
  "mn61:7.11": "",
  "mn61:8.1": "What do you think, Rāhula? ",
  "mn61:8.2": "What is the purpose of a mirror?” ",
  "mn61:8.3": "“It’s for checking your reflection, sir.” ",
  "mn61:8.4": "“In the same way, deeds of body, speech, and mind should be done only after repeated checking. ",
  "mn61:9.1": "When you want to act with the body, you should check on that same deed: ",
  "mn61:9.2": "‘Does this act with the body that I want to do lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both? ",
  "mn61:9.3": "Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’ ",
  "mn61:9.4": "If, while checking in this way, you know: ",
  "mn61:9.5": "‘This act with the body that I want to do leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. ",
  "mn61:9.6": "It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ To the best of your ability, Rāhula, you should not do such a deed. ",
  "mn61:9.7": "But if, while checking in this way, you know: ",
  "mn61:9.8": "‘This act with the body that I want to do doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. ",
  "mn61:9.9": "It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should do such a deed. ",
  "mn61:10.1": "While you are acting with the body, you should check on that same act: ",
  "mn61:10.2": "‘Does this act with the body that I am doing lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both? ",
  "mn61:10.3": "Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’ ",

  "mn61:10.5": "‘This act with the body that I am doing leads to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. ",
  "mn61:10.6": "It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should desist from such a deed. ",
  "mn61:10.7": "But if, while checking in this way, you know: ",
  "mn61:10.8": "‘This act with the body that I am doing doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. ",
  "mn61:10.9": "It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should continue doing such a deed. ",
  "mn61:11.1": "After you have acted with the body, you should check on that same act: ",
  "mn61:11.2": "‘Does this act with the body that I have done lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both? ",
  "mn61:11.3": "Is it unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result?’ ",

  "mn61:11.6": "It’s unskillful, with suffering as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should confess, reveal, and clarify such a deed to the Teacher or a sensible spiritual companion. ",
  "mn61:11.7": "And having revealed it you should restrain yourself in future. ",
  "mn61:11.8": "But if, while checking in this way, you know: ",
  "mn61:11.9": "‘This act with the body that I have done doesn’t lead to hurting myself, hurting others, or hurting both. ",
  "mn61:11.10": "It’s skillful, with happiness as its outcome and result.’ Then, Rāhula, you should live in rapture and joy because of this, training day and night in skillful qualities. ",
