  "mn50:3.2": "He saw that Māra the Wicked had got inside his belly. ",
  "mn50:3.3": "So he said to Māra, ",

  "mn50:8.1": "Once upon a time, Wicked One, I was a Māra named Dūsī, and I had a sister named Kāḷī. ",
  "mn50:8.2": "You were her son, ",

  "mn50:9.1": "At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. ",

  "mn50:10.1": "But when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he easily attained the cessation of perception and feeling. ",
  "mn50:10.2": "Once upon a time, Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception and feeling. ",
  "mn50:10.3": "Some cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him sitting there ",

  "mn50:10.8": "They collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, heaped it all on Sañjīva’s body, set it on fire, and left. ",
  "mn50:11.1": "Then, when the night had passed, Sañjīva emerged from that attainment, shook out his robes, and, since it was morning, he robed up and entered the village for alms. ",
  "mn50:11.2": "Those cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him wandering for alms ",
