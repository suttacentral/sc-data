  "mn63:2.1": "Then as Venerable Māluṅkyaputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: ",
  "mn63:2.2": "“There are several convictions that the Buddha has left undeclared; he has set them aside and turned them down. ",
  "mn63:2.3": "For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are one and the same, or the soul is one thing, the body another; after death, a realized one still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists.

  "mn63:2.4": "The Buddha does not explain these points to me. ",

  "mn63:2.13": "",
  "mn63:2.14": "I shall disavow the training and return to a lesser life.” ",
  "mn63:3.1": "Then in the late afternoon, Māluṅkyaputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his thoughts. He then continued: ",
