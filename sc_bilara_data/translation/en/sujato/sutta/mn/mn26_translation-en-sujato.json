  "mn26:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn26:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn26:2.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. ",
  "mn26:2.2": "Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and said to him, ",
  "mn26:2.3": "“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. ",
  "mn26:2.4": "It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” ",
  "mn26:2.5": "“Well then, reverends, go to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage. ",
  "mn26:2.6": "Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” ",
  "mn26:2.7": "“Yes, reverend,” they replied. ",
  "mn26:3.1": "Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, the Buddha addressed Ānanda, ",
  "mn26:3.2": "“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother for the day’s meditation.” ",
  "mn26:3.3": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "mn26:3.4": "So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery. ",
  "mn26:3.5": "In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, ",
  "mn26:3.6": "“Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.” ",
  "mn26:3.7": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "mn26:3.8": "So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe. ",
  "mn26:3.9": "When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself. ",
  "mn26:3.10": "Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn26:3.11": "“Sir, the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is nearby. ",
  "mn26:3.12": "It’s so delightful, ",
  "mn26:3.13": "so lovely. ",
  "mn26:3.14": "Please visit it out of compassion.” ",
  "mn26:3.15": "The Buddha consented in silence. ",
  "mn26:4.1": "He went to the brahmin Rammaka’s hermitage. ",
  "mn26:4.2": "Now at that time several mendicants were sitting together in the hermitage talking about the teaching. ",
  "mn26:4.3": "The Buddha stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end. ",
  "mn26:4.4": "When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked with the latch. ",
  "mn26:4.5": "The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha, ",
  "mn26:4.6": "and he entered the hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out ",
  "mn26:4.7": "and addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn26:4.8": "“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” ",
  "mn26:4.9": "“Sir, our unfinished discussion on the teaching was about the Buddha himself when the Buddha arrived.” ",
  "mn26:4.10": "“Good, mendicants! ",
  "mn26:4.11": "It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together and talk about the teaching. ",
  "mn26:4.12": "When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things: ",
  "mn26:4.13": "discuss the teachings or keep noble silence. ",
  "mn26:5.1": "Mendicants, there are these two searches: ",
  "mn26:5.2": "the noble search and the ignoble search. ",
  "mn26:5.3": "And what is the ignoble search? ",
  "mn26:5.4": "It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn seeks what is also liable to be reborn. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, they seek what is also liable to these things. ",
  "mn26:6.1": "And what should be described as liable to be reborn? ",
  "mn26:6.2": "Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to be reborn. ",
  "mn26:6.3": "These attachments are liable to be reborn. ",
  "mn26:6.4": "Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to being reborn, seeks what is also liable to be reborn. ",
  "mn26:7.1": "And what should be described as liable to grow old? ",
  "mn26:7.2": "Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to grow old. ",
  "mn26:7.3": "These attachments are liable to grow old. ",
  "mn26:7.4": "Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to grow old, seeks what is also liable to grow old. ",
  "mn26:8.1": "And what should be described as liable to fall sick? ",
  "mn26:8.2": "Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to fall sick. ",
  "mn26:8.3": "These attachments are liable to fall sick. ",
  "mn26:8.4": "Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to falling sick, seeks what is also liable to fall sick. ",
  "mn26:9.1": "And what should be described as liable to die? ",
  "mn26:9.2": "Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to die. ",
  "mn26:9.3": "These attachments are liable to die. ",
  "mn26:9.4": "Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to die, seeks what is also liable to die. ",
  "mn26:10.1": "And what should be described as liable to sorrow? ",
  "mn26:10.2": "Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and elephants and cattle are liable to sorrow. ",
  "mn26:10.3": "These attachments are liable to sorrow. ",
  "mn26:10.4": "Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to sorrow, seeks what is also liable to sorrow. ",
  "mn26:11.1": "And what should be described as liable to corruption? ",
  "mn26:11.2": "Partners and children, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants and cattle, and gold and money are liable to corruption. ",
  "mn26:11.3": "These attachments are liable to corruption. ",
  "mn26:11.4": "Someone who is tied, infatuated, and attached to such things, themselves liable to corruption, seeks what is also liable to corruption. ",
  "mn26:11.5": "This is the ignoble search. ",
  "mn26:12.1": "And what is the noble search? ",
  "mn26:12.2": "It’s when someone who is themselves liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, seeks the unborn supreme sanctuary, extinguishment. Themselves liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, they seek the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment. ",
  "mn26:12.3": "This is the noble search. ",
  "mn26:13.1": "Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too, being liable to be reborn, sought what is also liable to be reborn. Myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, I sought what is also liable to these things. ",
  "mn26:13.2": "Then it occurred to me: ",
  "mn26:13.3": "‘Why do I, being liable to be reborn, grow old, fall sick, sorrow, die, and become corrupted, seek things that have the same nature? ",
  "mn26:13.4": "Why don’t I seek the unborn, unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment?’ ",
  "mn26:14.1": "Some time later, while still black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn26:15.1": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn26:15.2": "‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ ",
  "mn26:15.3": "Āḷāra Kālāma replied, ",
  "mn26:15.4": "‘Stay, venerable. ",
  "mn26:15.5": "This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn26:15.6": "I quickly memorized that teaching. ",
  "mn26:15.7": "So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others. ",
  "mn26:15.8": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:15.9": "‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.” ",
  "mn26:15.10": "Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’ ",
  "mn26:15.11": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn26:15.12": "‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’ ",
  "mn26:15.13": "When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness. ",
  "mn26:15.14": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:15.15": "‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith, ",
  "mn26:15.16": "energy, ",
  "mn26:15.17": "mindfulness, ",
  "mn26:15.18": "immersion, ",
  "mn26:15.19": "and wisdom; I too have these things. ",
  "mn26:15.20": "Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’ ",
  "mn26:15.21": "I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it. ",
  "mn26:15.22": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn26:15.23": "‘Reverend Kālāma, have you realized this teaching with your own insight up to this point, and declare having achieved it?’ ",
  "mn26:15.24": "‘I have, reverend.’ ",
  "mn26:15.25": "‘I too, reverend, have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn26:15.26": "‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate ",
  "mn26:15.27": "to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions! ",
  "mn26:15.28": "So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it. ",
  "mn26:15.29": "The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it. ",
  "mn26:15.30": "So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching that you know, I know. ",
  "mn26:15.31": "I am like you and you are like me. ",
  "mn26:15.32": "Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’ ",
  "mn26:15.33": "And that is how my teacher Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his student, on the same position as him, and honored me with lofty praise. ",
  "mn26:15.34": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:15.35": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’ ",
  "mn26:15.36": "Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. ",
  "mn26:16.1": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him, ",
  "mn26:16.2": "‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ ",
  "mn26:16.3": "Uddaka replied, ",
  "mn26:16.4": "‘Stay, venerable. ",
  "mn26:16.5": "This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn26:16.6": "I quickly memorized that teaching. ",
  "mn26:16.7": "So far as lip-recital and oral recitation were concerned, I spoke with knowledge and the authority of the elders. I claimed to know and see, and so did others. ",

  "mn26:16.12": "‘Reverend, to what extent did Rāma say he’d realized this teaching with his own insight?’ ",
  "mn26:16.13": "When I said this, Uddaka, son of Rāma, declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. ",
  "mn26:16.14": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:16.15": "‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith, ",
  "mn26:16.16": "energy, ",
  "mn26:16.17": "mindfulness, ",
  "mn26:16.18": "immersion, ",
  "mn26:16.19": "and wisdom; I too have these things. ",
  "mn26:16.20": "Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Rāma said he had realized with his own insight?’ ",
  "mn26:16.21": "I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it. ",
  "mn26:16.22": "So I approached Uddaka, son of Rāma, and said to him, ",
  "mn26:16.23": "‘Reverend, had Rāma realized this teaching with his own insight up to this point, and declared having achieved it?’ ",
  "mn26:16.24": "‘He had, reverend.’ ",
  "mn26:16.25": "‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn26:16.26": "‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate ",
  "mn26:16.27": "to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions! ",
  "mn26:16.28": "So the teaching that Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it. ",
  "mn26:16.29": "The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and live having achieved it, Rāma had realized with his own insight, and declared having achieved it. ",
  "mn26:16.30": "So the teaching that Rāma directly knew, you know, and the teaching you know, Rāma directly knew. ",
  "mn26:16.31": "Rāma was like you and you are like Rāma. ",
  "mn26:16.32": "Come now, reverend! You should lead this community.’ ",
  "mn26:16.33": "And that is how my spiritual companion Uddaka, son of Rāma, placed me in the position of a teacher, and honored me with lofty praise. ",
  "mn26:16.34": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:16.35": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’ ",
  "mn26:16.36": "Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. ",
  "mn26:17.1": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at Senanigama near Uruvelā. ",
  "mn26:17.2": "There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village for alms. ",
  "mn26:17.3": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:17.4": "‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to go for alms. ",
  "mn26:17.5": "This is good enough for a gentleman who wishes to put forth effort in meditation.’ ",
  "mn26:17.6": "So I sat down right there, thinking, ",
  "mn26:17.7": "‘This is good enough for meditation.’ ",
  "mn26:18.1": "And so, being myself liable to be reborn, understanding the drawbacks in being liable to be reborn, I sought the unborn supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and I found it. Being myself liable to grow old, fall sick, die, sorrow, and become corrupted, understanding the drawbacks in these things, I sought the unaging, unailing, undying, sorrowless, uncorrupted supreme sanctuary, extinguishment—and I found it. ",
  "mn26:18.2": "Knowledge and vision arose in me: ",
  "mn26:18.3": "‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there are no more future lives.’ ",
  "mn26:19.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:19.2": "‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. ",
  "mn26:19.3": "But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. ",
  "mn26:19.4": "It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. ",
  "mn26:19.5": "It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. ",
  "mn26:19.6": "And if I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’ ",
  "mn26:19.7": "And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me: ",
  "mn26:19.8": "‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this, ",
  "mn26:19.9": "enough with trying to explain it! ",
  "mn26:19.10": "This teaching is not easily understood ",
  "mn26:19.11": "by those mired in greed and hate. ",
  "mn26:19.12": "Those besotted by greed can’t see ",
  "mn26:19.13": "what’s subtle, going against the stream, ",
  "mn26:19.14": "deep, hard to see, and very fine, ",
  "mn26:19.15": "for they’re shrouded in a mass of darkness.’ ",
  "mn26:19.16": "So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. ",
  "mn26:20.1": "Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, thought, ",
  "mn26:20.2": "‘Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’ ",
  "mn26:20.3": "Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. ",
  "mn26:20.4": "He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, ",
  "mn26:20.5": "‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! ",
  "mn26:20.6": "There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. ",
  "mn26:20.7": "There will be those who understand the teaching!’ ",
  "mn26:20.8": "That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. ",
  "mn26:20.9": "Then he went on to say: ",
  "mn26:20.10": "‘Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past ",
  "mn26:20.11": "an impure teaching thought up by those still stained. ",
  "mn26:20.12": "Fling open the door to the deathless! ",
  "mn26:20.13": "Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered. ",
  "mn26:20.14": "Standing high on a rocky mountain, ",
  "mn26:20.15": "you can see the people all around. ",
  "mn26:20.16": "In just the same way, all-seer, wise one, ",
  "mn26:20.17": "having ascended the Temple of Truth, ",
  "mn26:20.18": "rid of sorrow, look upon the people ",
  "mn26:20.19": "swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age. ",
  "mn26:20.20": "Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, ",
  "mn26:20.21": "wander the world without obligation. ",
  "mn26:20.22": "Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! ",
  "mn26:20.23": "There will be those who understand!’ ",
  "mn26:21.1": "Then, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, I surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of my compassion for sentient beings. ",
  "mn26:21.2": "And I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. ",
  "mn26:21.3": "It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. ",
  "mn26:21.4": "In the same way, I saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes. ",
  "mn26:21.5": "Then I replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati: ",
  "mn26:21.6": "‘Flung open are the doors to the deathless! ",
  "mn26:21.7": "Let those with ears to hear commit to faith. ",
  "mn26:21.8": "Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, <j>I did not teach ",
  "mn26:21.9": "the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.’ ",
  "mn26:21.10": "Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for me to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right, before vanishing right there. ",
  "mn26:22.1": "Then I thought, ",
  "mn26:22.2": "‘Who should I teach first of all? ",
  "mn26:22.3": "Who will quickly understand this teaching?’ ",
  "mn26:22.4": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:22.5": "‘That Āḷāra Kālāma is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes. ",
  "mn26:22.6": "Why don’t I teach him first of all? ",
  "mn26:22.7": "He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’ ",
  "mn26:22.8": "But a deity came to me and said, ",
  "mn26:22.9": "‘Sir, Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’ ",
  "mn26:22.10": "And knowledge and vision arose in me, ",
  "mn26:22.11": "‘Āḷāra Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’ ",
  "mn26:22.12": "I thought, ",
  "mn26:22.13": "‘This is a great loss for Āḷāra Kālāma. ",
  "mn26:22.14": "If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’ ",
  "mn26:23.1": "Then I thought, ",
  "mn26:23.2": "‘Who should I teach first of all? ",
  "mn26:23.3": "Who will quickly understand this teaching?’ ",
  "mn26:23.4": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:23.5": "‘That Uddaka, son of Rāma, is astute, competent, clever, and has long had little dust in his eyes. ",
  "mn26:23.6": "Why don’t I teach him first of all? ",
  "mn26:23.7": "He’ll quickly understand the teaching.’ ",
  "mn26:23.8": "But a deity came to me and said, ",
  "mn26:23.9": "‘Sir, Uddaka, son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’ ",
  "mn26:23.10": "And knowledge and vision arose in me, ",
  "mn26:23.11": "‘Uddaka, son of Rāma, passed away just last night.’ ",
  "mn26:23.12": "I thought, ",
  "mn26:23.13": "‘This is a great loss for Uddaka. ",
  "mn26:23.14": "If he had heard the teaching, he would have understood it quickly.’ ",
  "mn26:24.1": "Then I thought, ",
  "mn26:24.2": "‘Who should I teach first of all? ",
  "mn26:24.3": "Who will quickly understand this teaching?’ ",
  "mn26:24.4": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn26:24.5": "‘The group of five mendicants were very helpful to me. They looked after me during my time of resolute striving. ",
  "mn26:24.6": "Why don’t I teach them first of all?’ ",
  "mn26:24.7": "Then I thought, ",
  "mn26:24.8": "‘Where are the group of five mendicants staying these days?’ ",
  "mn26:24.9": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman I saw that the group of five mendicants were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. ",
  "mn26:24.10": "So, when I had stayed in Uruvelā as long as I wished, I set out for Benares. ",
  "mn26:25.1": "While I was traveling along the road between Gayā and Bodhgaya, the Ājīvaka ascetic Upaka saw me ",
  "mn26:25.2": "and said, ",
  "mn26:25.3": "‘Reverend, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. ",
  "mn26:25.4": "In whose name have you gone forth, reverend? Who is your Teacher? Whose teaching do you believe in?’ ",
  "mn26:25.5": "I replied to Upaka in verse: ",
  "mn26:25.6": "‘I am the champion, the knower of all, ",
