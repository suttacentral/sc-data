  "mn70:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kāsis together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. ",
  "mn70:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ",
  "mn70:2.1": "“Mendicants, I abstain from eating at night. ",
  "mn70:2.2": "Doing so, I find that I’m healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",
  "mn70:2.3": "You too should abstain from eating at night. ",
  "mn70:2.4": "Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.” ",
  "mn70:2.5": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn70:3.1": "Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the land of the Kāsis, arrived at a town of the Kāsis named Kīṭāgiri, ",
  "mn70:3.2": "and stayed there. ",
  "mn70:4.1": "Now at that time the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka were residing at Kīṭāgiri. ",
  "mn70:4.2": "Then several mendicants went up to them and said, ",
  "mn70:4.3": "“Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "mn70:4.4": "Doing so, they find that they’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",
  "mn70:4.5": "You too should abstain from eating at night. ",
  "mn70:4.6": "Doing so, you’ll find that you’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably.” ",
  "mn70:4.7": "When they said this, the mendicants who followed Assaji and Punabbasuka said to them, ",
  "mn70:4.8": "“Reverends, we eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day. ",
  "mn70:4.9": "Doing so, we find that we’re healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. ",
  "mn70:4.10": "Why should we give up what is apparent in the present to chase after what takes effect over time? ",
  "mn70:4.11": "We shall eat in the evening, the morning, and at the wrong time of day.” ",
  "mn70:5.1": "Since those mendicants were unable to persuade the mendicants who were followers of Assaji and Punabbasuka, they approached the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

  "mn70:6.4": "“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those mendicants and said, ",
  "mn70:6.5": "“Venerables, the teacher summons you.” ",
  "mn70:6.6": "“Yes, reverend,” those mendicants replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. ",
  "mn70:6.7": "The Buddha said to them, “Is it really true, mendicants, that several mendicants went to you and said: ",
  "mn70:6.8": "‘Reverends, the Buddha abstains from eating at night, and so does the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
