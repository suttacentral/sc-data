  "mn7:21.3": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "mn7:21.4": "I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
