  "mn98:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. ",
  "mn98:2.1": "Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included ",
  "mn98:2.2": "the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jānussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. ",
  "mn98:3.1": "Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question: ",
  "mn98:3.2": "“How do you become a brahmin?” ",
  "mn98:3.3": "Bhāradvāja said this: ",
  "mn98:3.4": "“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation—",
  "mn98:3.5": "then you’re a brahmin.” ",
  "mn98:3.6": "Vāseṭṭha said this: ",
  "mn98:3.7": "“When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—",
  "mn98:3.8": "then you’re a brahmin.” ",
  "mn98:4.1": "But neither was able to persuade the other. ",
  "mn98:5.1": "So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, ",
  "mn98:5.2": "“Worthy Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. ",
  "mn98:5.3": "He has this good reputation: ",

  "mn98:5.6": "As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” ",
  "mn98:5.7": "“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. ",
  "mn98:6.1": "So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn98:6.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, ",
  "mn98:6.3": "and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse: ",

  "mn98:7.11": "For Bhāradvāja says that ",
  "mn98:7.12": "one is a brahmin due to birth, ",
  "mn98:7.13": "but I declare it’s because of one’s deeds. ",
  "mn98:7.14": "Oh Clear-eyed One, know this as our debate. ",
  "mn98:7.15": "Since neither of us was able ",
  "mn98:7.16": "to convince the other, ",
  "mn98:7.17": "we’ve come to ask you, sir, ",
  "mn98:7.18": "renowned as the awakened one. ",

  "mn98:7.26": "or else because of deeds? ",
  "mn98:7.27": "We don’t know, please tell us, ",
