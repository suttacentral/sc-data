  "mn98:2.2": "the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. ",
  "mn98:3.1": "Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discussion the question of ",
  "mn98:3.2": "how one is a brahmin. ",
  "mn98:3.3": "Bhāradvāja said this: ",
  "mn98:3.4": "“When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation—",
  "mn98:3.5": "then you’re a brahmin.” ",

  "mn98:7.14": "Oh seer, know this as our debate. ",
