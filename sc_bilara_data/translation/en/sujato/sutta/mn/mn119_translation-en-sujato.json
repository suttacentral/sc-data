  "mn119:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn119:2.1": "Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several mendicants sat together in the assembly hall and this discussion came up among them. ",
  "mn119:2.2": "“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing, ",
  "mn119:2.3": "how the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha has said that mindfulness of the body, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial.” ",
  "mn119:2.4": "But their conversation was left unfinished. Then the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat on the seat spread out ",
  "mn119:2.5": "and addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn119:2.6": "“Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” ",
  "mn119:2.7": "So the mendicants told him what they had been talking about. The Buddha said: ",

  "mn119:3.1": "“And how, mendicants, is mindfulness of the body developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial? ",
  "mn119:4.1": "It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in their presence. ",
  "mn119:4.2": "Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. ",
  "mn119:4.3": "Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ ",
  "mn119:4.4": "When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ ",
  "mn119:4.5": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’",
  "mn119:4.6": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’ ",
  "mn119:4.7": "As they meditate like this—diligent, keen, and resolute—memories and thoughts tied to domestic life are given up. ",
  "mn119:4.8": "Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. ",
  "mn119:4.9": "That’s how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body. ",
  "mn119:5.1": "Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know ‘I am walking’. When standing they know ‘I am standing’. When sitting they know ‘I am sitting’. And when lying down they know ‘I am lying down’. ",
  "mn119:5.2": "Whatever posture their body is in, they know it. ",

  "mn119:5.5": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body. ",
  "mn119:6.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.

  "mn119:6.4": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body. ",

  "mn119:7.2": "‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ ",
  "mn119:7.3": "It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as ",
  "mn119:7.4": "fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. ",
  "mn119:7.5": "And a person with clear eyes were to open it and examine the contents: ",

  "mn119:7.11": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body. ",
  "mn119:8.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: ",
  "mn119:8.2": "‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’ ",
  "mn119:8.3": "It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into chops. ",
  "mn119:8.4": "In the same way, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: ",

  "mn119:9.1": "Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. ",
  "mn119:9.2": "They’d compare it with their own body: ",
  "mn119:9.3": "‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ ",

  "mn119:15-17.9": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body. ",
  "mn119:18.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn119:18.2": "They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. ",
  "mn119:18.3": "It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. ",
  "mn119:18.4": "In the same way, they drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. ",

  "mn119:18.7": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body. ",
  "mn119:19.1": "Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn119:19.2": "They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. ",
  "mn119:19.3": "It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and the heavens would not properly bestow showers from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. ",

  "mn119:20.1": "Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",
  "mn119:20.2": "They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. ",
  "mn119:20.3": "It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water. ",

  "mn119:20.6": "That too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body. ",
  "mn119:21.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant, with the giving up of pleasure and pain and the disappearance of former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ",
  "mn119:21.2": "They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not filled with pure bright mind. ",
