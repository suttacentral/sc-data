  "mn129:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn129:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn129:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn129:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn129:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn129:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn129:2.1": "“These are the three characteristics, signs, and manifestations of a fool. ",
  "mn129:2.2": "What three? ",
  "mn129:2.3": "A fool thinks poorly, speaks poorly, and acts poorly. ",
  "mn129:2.4": "If a fool didn’t think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then how would the astute know of them, ",
  "mn129:2.5": "‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’? ",
  "mn129:2.6": "But since a fool does think poorly, speak poorly, and act poorly, then the astute do know of them, ",
  "mn129:2.7": "‘This worthy one is a fool, an untrue person’. ",
  "mn129:3.1": "A fool experiences three kinds of suffering and sadness in this very life. ",
  "mn129:3.2": "Suppose a fool is sitting in a council hall, a street, or a crossroad, ",
  "mn129:3.3": "where people are discussing what is proper and fitting. ",
  "mn129:3.4": "And suppose that fool is someone who kills living creatures, steals, commits sexual misconduct, lies, and consumes beer, wine, and liquor intoxicants. ",
  "mn129:3.5": "Then that fool thinks, ",
  "mn129:3.6": "‘These people are discussing what is proper and fitting. ",
  "mn129:3.7": "But those bad things are found in me and I exhibit them!’ ",
  "mn129:3.8": "This is the first kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life. ",
  "mn129:4.1": "Furthermore, a fool sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—",
  "mn129:4.2": "whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the hounds, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. ",
  "mn129:4.3": "Then that fool thinks, ",
  "mn129:4.4": "‘The kinds of deeds for which the kings inflict such punishments—",
  "mn129:4.5": "",
  "mn129:4.6": "those things are found in me and I exhibit them! ",
  "mn129:4.7": "If the kings find out about me, they will inflict the same kinds of punishments on me!’ ",
  "mn129:4.8": "",
  "mn129:4.9": "This is the second kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life. ",
  "mn129:5.1": "Furthermore, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them. ",
  "mn129:5.2": "It is like the shadow of a great mountain peak in the evening as it settles down, rests down, and lays down upon the earth. ",
  "mn129:5.3": "In the same way, when a fool is resting on a chair or a bed or on the ground, their past bad deeds—misconduct of body, speech, and mind—settle down upon them, rest down upon them, and lay down upon them. ",
  "mn129:5.4": "Then that fool thinks, ",
  "mn129:5.5": "‘Alas, I haven’t done good and skillful things that keep me safe. ",
  "mn129:5.6": "And I have done bad things, violence and sin. ",
  "mn129:5.7": "When I depart, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’ ",
  "mn129:5.8": "They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breasts and falling into confusion. ",
  "mn129:5.9": "This is the third kind of suffering and sadness that a fool experiences in this very life. ",
  "mn129:6.1": "Having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",
  "mn129:7.1": "And if there’s anything of which it may be rightly said that ",
  "mn129:7.2": "it is utterly unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable, it is of hell that this should be said. ",
  "mn129:7.3": "",
  "mn129:7.4": "So much so that it’s not easy to give a simile for how painful hell is.” ",
  "mn129:7.5": "When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, ",
  "mn129:7.6": "“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” ",
  "mn129:8.1": "“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. ",
  "mn129:8.2": "“Suppose they arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying, ",
  "mn129:8.3": "‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ ",
  "mn129:8.4": "The king would say, ",
  "mn129:8.5": "‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’ ",
  "mn129:8.6": "The king’s men did as they were told. ",
  "mn129:8.7": "Then at midday the king would say, ",
  "mn129:8.8": "‘My men, how is that man?’ ",
  "mn129:8.9": "‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ ",
  "mn129:8.10": "The king would say, ",
  "mn129:8.11": "‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the midday with a hundred spears!’ ",
  "mn129:8.12": "The king’s men did as they were told. ",
  "mn129:8.13": "Then late in the afternoon the king would say, ",
  "mn129:8.14": "‘My men, how is that man?’ ",
  "mn129:8.15": "‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ ",
  "mn129:8.16": "The king would say, ",
  "mn129:8.17": "‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’ ",
  "mn129:8.18": "The king’s men did as they were told. ",
  "mn129:8.19": "What do you think, mendicants? ",
  "mn129:8.20": "Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears?” ",
  "mn129:8.21": "“Sir, that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!” ",
  "mn129:9.1": "Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn129:9.2": "“What do you think, mendicants? ",
  "mn129:9.3": "Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?” ",
  "mn129:9.4": "“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.” ",
  "mn129:9.5": "“In the same way, compared to the suffering in hell, the pain and distress experienced by that man due to being struck with three hundred spears doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison. ",
  "mn129:10.1": "The wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion. ",
  "mn129:10.2": "They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest. ",
  "mn129:10.3": "And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated. ",
  "mn129:11.1": "The wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. … ",
  "mn129:11.2": "",
  "mn129:12.1": "They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. … ",
  "mn129:12.2": "",
  "mn129:13.1": "They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. … ",
  "mn129:13.2": "",
  "mn129:14.1": "They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. … ",
  "mn129:14.2": "",
  "mn129:15.1": "The wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them into a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing. ",
  "mn129:15.2": "",
  "mn129:15.3": "There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round. ",
  "mn129:15.4": "And there they feel painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated. ",
  "mn129:16.1": "The wardens of hell toss them in the Great Hell. ",
  "mn129:16.2": "Now, about that Great Hell: ",
  "mn129:16.3": "‘Four are its corners, four its doors, ",
  "mn129:16.4": "neatly divided section by section. ",
  "mn129:16.5": "Surrounded by an iron wall, ",
  "mn129:16.6": "of iron is its roof. ",
  "mn129:16.7": "The ground is even made of iron, ",
  "mn129:16.8": "it burns with fierce fire. ",
  "mn129:16.9": "The heat forever radiates ",
  "mn129:16.10": "a hundred leagues around.’ ",
  "mn129:17.1": "I could tell you many different things about hell. ",
  "mn129:17.2": "So much so that it’s not easy to completely describe the suffering in hell. ",
  "mn129:18.1": "There are, mendicants, animals that feed on grass. ",
  "mn129:18.2": "They eat by cropping fresh or dried grass with their teeth. ",
  "mn129:18.3": "And what animals feed on grass? ",
  "mn129:18.4": "Elephants, horses, cattle, donkeys, goats, deer, and various others. ",
  "mn129:18.5": "A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on grass. ",
  "mn129:19.1": "There are animals that feed on dung. ",
  "mn129:19.2": "When they catch a whiff of dung they run to it, thinking, ",
  "mn129:19.3": "‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’ ",
  "mn129:19.4": "It’s like when brahmins smell a burnt offering, they run to it, thinking, ",
  "mn129:19.5": "‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’ ",
  "mn129:19.6": "In the same way, there are animals that feed on dung. ",

  "mn129:19.8": "‘There we’ll eat! There we’ll eat!’ ",

  "mn129:19.11": "A fool who used to be a glutton here and did bad deeds here, after death is reborn in the company of those sentient beings who feed on dung. ",

  "mn129:23.1": "I could tell you many different things about the animal realm. ",
  "mn129:23.2": "So much so that it’s not easy to completely describe the suffering in the animal realm. ",
  "mn129:24.1": "Mendicants, suppose a person were to throw a yoke with a single hole into the ocean. ",
  "mn129:24.2": "The east wind wafts it west; the west wind wafts it east; the north wind wafts it south; and the south wind wafts it north. ",
  "mn129:24.3": "And there was a one-eyed turtle who popped up once every hundred years. ",
  "mn129:24.4": "What do you think, mendicants? ",
  "mn129:24.5": "Would that one-eyed turtle still poke its neck through the hole in that yoke?” ",
  "mn129:24.6": "“No, sir. ",
  "mn129:24.7": "Only after a very long time, sir, if ever.” ",
  "mn129:24.8": "“That one-eyed turtle would poke its neck through the hole in that yoke sooner than a fool who has fallen to the underworld would be reborn as a human being, I say. ",
  "mn129:24.9": "Why is that? ",
  "mn129:24.10": "Because in that place there’s no principled or moral conduct, and no doing what is good and skillful. ",
  "mn129:24.11": "There they just prey on each other, preying on the weak. ",
  "mn129:25.1": "And suppose that fool, after a very long time, returned to the human realm. ",
  "mn129:25.2": "They’d be reborn in a low class family—a family of corpse-workers, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or scavengers. ",
  "mn129:25.3": "Such families are poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. ",
  "mn129:25.4": "And they’d be ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. ",
  "mn129:25.5": "And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. ",
  "mn129:25.6": "When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",
  "mn129:26.1": "Suppose a gambler were to lose his wife and child, all his property, and then get thrown in jail with his first losing hand. ",
  "mn129:26.2": "Such a losing hand is trivial compared to ",
  "mn129:26.3": "the losing hand whereby a fool, having done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. ",
  "mn129:26.4": "This is the total fulfillment of the fool’s level. ",

  "mn129:39.5": "The fragrance of sandal floats from her body, and lotus from her mouth. ",
  "mn129:39.6": "She gets up before the king and goes to bed after him, and is obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. ",
  "mn129:39.7": "The woman-treasure does not betray the wheel-turning monarch even in thought, still less in deed. ",
  "mn129:39.8": "Such is the woman-treasure who appears to the wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "mn129:40.1": "Next, the householder-treasure appears to the wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "mn129:40.2": "The power of clairvoyance manifests in him as a result of past deeds, by which he sees treasure troves, both owned and ownerless. ",
  "mn129:40.3": "He approaches the wheel-turning monarch and says, ",
  "mn129:40.4": "‘Relax, sire. I will take care of the treasury.’ ",
  "mn129:40.5": "Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same householder-treasure, boarded a boat and sailed to the middle of the Ganges river. Then he said to the householder-treasure, ",

  "mn129:40.7": "‘Well then, great king, draw the boat up to one shore.’ ",
  "mn129:40.8": "‘It’s right here, householder, that I need gold, both coined and uncoined.’ ",
  "mn129:40.9": "Then that householder-treasure, immersing both hands in the water, pulled up a pot full of gold, both coined and uncoined, and said to the king, ",
  "mn129:40.10": "‘Is this sufficient, great king? Has enough been done, great king, enough offered?’ ",
  "mn129:40.11": "The wheel-turning monarch said, ",
  "mn129:40.12": "‘That is sufficient, householder. Enough has been done, enough offered.’ ",

  "mn129:41.6": "These are the seven treasures possessed by a wheel-turning monarch. ",
  "mn129:42.1": "And what are the four blessings? ",
  "mn129:42.2": "A wheel-turning monarch is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty, more so than other humans. ",
  "mn129:42.3": "This is the first blessing. ",
  "mn129:43.1": "Furthermore, he is long-lived, more so than other humans. ",
  "mn129:43.2": "This is the second blessing. ",
  "mn129:44.1": "Furthermore, he is rarely ill or unwell, and his stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, more so than other humans. ",
  "mn129:44.2": "This is the third blessing. ",
  "mn129:45.1": "Furthermore, a wheel-turning monarch is as dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders ",
  "mn129:45.2": "as a father is to his children. ",
  "mn129:45.3": "",
  "mn129:45.4": "And the brahmins and householders are as dear to the wheel-turning monarch ",
  "mn129:45.5": "as children are to their father. ",
  "mn129:45.6": "",
  "mn129:45.7": "Once it so happened that a wheel-turning monarch went with his army of four divisions to visit a park. ",
  "mn129:45.8": "Then the brahmins and householders went up to him and said, ",
  "mn129:45.9": "‘Slow down, Your Majesty, so we may see you longer!’ ",
  "mn129:45.10": "And the king addressed his charioteer, ",
  "mn129:45.11": "‘Drive slowly, charioteer, so I can see the brahmins and householders longer!’ ",

  "mn129:46.3": "“Sir, a wheel-turning monarch who possessed even a single one of these treasures would experience pleasure and happiness because of that, let alone all seven treasures and four blessings!” ",
  "mn129:47.1": "Then the Buddha, picking up a stone the size of his palm, addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn129:47.2": "“What do you think, mendicants? ",
  "mn129:47.3": "Which is bigger: the stone the size of my palm that I’ve picked up, or the Himalayas, the king of mountains?” ",
  "mn129:47.4": "“Sir, the stone you’ve picked up is tiny. Compared to the Himalayas, it doesn’t count, it’s not worth a fraction, there’s no comparison.” ",
  "mn129:47.5": "“In the same way, compared to the happiness of heaven, the pleasure and happiness experienced by a wheel-turning monarch due to those seven treasures and those four blessings doesn’t even count, it’s not even a fraction, there’s no comparison. ",
  "mn129:48.1": "And suppose that astute person, after a very long time, returned to the human realm. ",
  "mn129:48.2": "They’d be reborn in a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. ",
  "mn129:48.3": "And they’d be attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They’d get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and a bed, house, and lighting. ",
  "mn129:48.4": "And they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. ",
  "mn129:48.5": "When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. ",
  "mn129:49.1": "Suppose a gambler was to win a big pile of money with the first perfect hand. ",
  "mn129:49.2": "Such a perfect hand is trivial compared to ",
  "mn129:49.3": "the perfect hand whereby an astute person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. ",
  "mn129:49.4": "This is the total fulfillment of the astute person’s level.” ",
  "mn129:49.5": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn129:49.6": "Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. "
