  "mn22:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn22:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn22:2.1": "Now at that time a mendicant called Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture trapper, had the following harmful misconception: ",
  "mn22:2.2": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” ",
  "mn22:2.3": "Several mendicants heard this rumour. ",
  "mn22:2.4": "",
  "mn22:2.5": "",
  "mn22:3.1": "They went up to Ariṭṭha and said to him, ",

  "mn22:3.3": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them’?” ",
  "mn22:3.4": "“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, the acts that he says are obstructions are not really obstructions for the one who performs them.” ",
  "mn22:3.5": "Then, wishing to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him, ",
  "mn22:3.6": "“Don’t say that, Ariṭṭha! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. ",
  "mn22:3.7": "In many ways the Buddha has said that obstructive acts are obstructive, and that they really do obstruct the one who performs them. ",
  "mn22:3.8": "The Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. ",
  "mn22:3.9": "With the similes of a skeleton … ",

  "mn22:3.19": "But even though the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him in this way, Ariṭṭha obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it. ",
  "mn22:3.20": "",
  "mn22:3.21": "When they weren’t able to dissuade Ariṭṭha from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

  "mn22:6.15": "This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.” ",
  "mn22:7.1": "Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, ",
  "mn22:7.2": "“What do you think, mendicants? ",
  "mn22:7.3": "Has this mendicant Ariṭṭha kindled even a spark of ardor in this teaching and training?” ",

  "mn22:7.6": "When this was said, Ariṭṭha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. ",

  "mn22:8.3": "“No, sir. ",

  "mn22:13.17": "What do you think, mendicants? ",
