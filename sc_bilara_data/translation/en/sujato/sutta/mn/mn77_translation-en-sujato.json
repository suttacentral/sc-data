  "mn77:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "mn77:2.1": "Now at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground. ",
  "mn77:2.2": "They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers. ",
  "mn77:3.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. ",
  "mn77:3.2": "Then it occurred to him, ",
  "mn77:3.3": "“It’s too early to wander for alms in Rājagaha. ",
  "mn77:3.4": "Why don’t I visit the wanderer Sakuludāyī at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground?” ",
  "mn77:4.1": "So the Buddha went to the monastery of the wanderers. ",
  "mn77:4.2": "Now at that time, Sakuludāyī was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as ",
  "mn77:4.3": "talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence.

  "mn77:4.4": "Sakuludāyī saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, ",

  "mn77:6.3": "Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other religions were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them: ",
  "mn77:6.4": "‘The people of Aṅga and Magadha are so fortunate, so very fortunate! ",
  "mn77:6.5": "For there are these ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and tutor a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. And they have come down for the rainy season residence at Rājagaha. ",

Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!” ",

  "mn77:6.70": "Even when disciples of the ascetic Gotama, having clashed with their spiritual companions, disavow the training and return to a lesser life, they speak only praise of the teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. They blame only themselves, not others: “We were unlucky, we had little merit. For even after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we weren’t able to practice for life the perfectly full and pure spiritual life.” ",
  "mn77:6.71": "They become monastery workers or lay followers, and they proceed having undertaken the five precepts. ",

  "mn77:8.6": "This is the second such quality I see in the Buddha. ",
  "mn77:8.7": "Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of almsfood, and praises such contentment. ",
  "mn77:8.8": "This is the third such quality I see in the Buddha. ",
  "mn77:8.9": "Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of lodging, and praises such contentment. ",

  "mn77:8.12": "This is the fifth such quality I see in the Buddha. ",
  "mn77:8.13": "These are the five qualities I see in the Buddha, because of which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate him; and honoring and respecting him, they remain loyal to him.” ",
  "mn77:9.1": "“Suppose, Udāyī, my disciples were loyal to me because I eat little. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat a tumbler of food, or half a tumbler; they eat a wood-apple, or half a wood-apple. ",
  "mn77:9.2": "But sometimes I even eat this bowl full to the brim, or even more. ",
  "mn77:9.3": "So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I eat little, then those disciples who eat even less would not be loyal to me. ",
  "mn77:9.4": "Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of robe. Well, there are disciples of mine who have rag robes, wearing shabby robes. They gather scraps from charnel grounds, rubbish dumps, and shops, make them into a patchwork robe and wear it. ",
  "mn77:9.5": "But sometimes I wear robes offered by householders that are strong, yet next to which bottle-gourd down is coarse. ",
  "mn77:9.6": "So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of robe, then those disciples who wear rag robes would not be loyal to me. ",
  "mn77:9.7": "Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of almsfood. Well, there are disciples of mine who eat only almsfood, wander indiscriminately for almsfood, happy to eat whatever they glean. When they’ve entered an inhabited area, they don’t consent when invited to sit down. ",
  "mn77:9.8": "But sometimes I even eat by invitation boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces. ",
  "mn77:9.9": "So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of almsfood, then those disciples who eat only almsfood would not be loyal to me. ",
  "mn77:9.10": "Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of lodging. Well, there are disciples of mine who stay at the root of a tree, in the open air. For eight months they don’t go under a roof. ",
  "mn77:9.11": "But sometimes I even stay in bungalows, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with doors fastened and windows shuttered. ",
  "mn77:9.12": "So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m content with any kind of lodging, then those disciples who stay at the root of a tree would not be loyal to me. ",
  "mn77:9.13": "Suppose my disciples were loyal to me because I’m secluded and I praise seclusion. Well, there are disciples of mine who live in the wilderness, in remote lodgings. Having ventured deep into remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest, they live there, coming down to the midst of the Saṅgha each fortnight for the recitation of the monastic code. ",
  "mn77:9.14": "But sometimes I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their chief ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. ",
  "mn77:9.15": "So if it were the case that my disciples are loyal to me because I’m secluded and praise seclusion, then those disciples who live in the wilderness would not be loyal to me. ",
  "mn77:9.16": "So, Udāyī, it’s not because of these five qualities that my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me. ",
  "mn77:10.1": "There are five other qualities because of which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and venerate me; and honoring and respecting me, they remain loyal to me. ",
  "mn77:10.2": "What five? ",
  "mn77:10.3": "Firstly, my disciples esteem me for the higher ethics: ",
  "mn77:10.4": "‘The ascetic Gotama is ethical. He possesses the entire spectrum of ethical conduct to the highest degree.’ ",

  "mn77:13.3": "It’s not possible that he would fail to foresee grounds for future criticism, or to legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up.’ ",
  "mn77:13.4": "What do you think, Udāyī? ",
