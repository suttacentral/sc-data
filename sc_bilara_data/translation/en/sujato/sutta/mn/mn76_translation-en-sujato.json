  "mn76:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. ",
  "mn76:2.1": "Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was residing at the cave of the wavy leaf fig tree together with a large assembly of around five hundred wanderers. ",
  "mn76:3.1": "Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Ānanda came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: ",
  "mn76:3.2": "“Come, reverends, let’s go to the Devakata Pool to see the cave.” ",
  "mn76:3.3": "“Yes, reverend,” they replied. ",
  "mn76:3.4": "Then Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Devakata Pool. ",
  "mn76:4.1": "Now at that time, Sandaka and the large assembly of wanderers were sitting together making an uproar, a colossal racket. They engaged in all kinds of low talk, such as ",
  "mn76:4.2": "talk about kings, bandits, and chief ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. ",
  "mn76:4.3": "Sandaka saw Ānanda coming off in the distance, ",
  "mn76:4.4": "and hushed his own assembly, ",
  "mn76:4.5": "“Be quiet, good fellows, don’t make a sound. ",
  "mn76:4.6": "The ascetic Ānanda, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming. ",
  "mn76:4.7": "He is included among the disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Kosambī. ",
  "mn76:4.8": "Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. ",
  "mn76:4.9": "Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” ",
  "mn76:4.10": "Then those wanderers fell silent. ",

  "mn76:5.10": "“Worthy Ānanda, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now. ",
  "mn76:5.11": "It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later. ",
  "mn76:5.12": "It’d be great if the worthy Ānanda himself would give a Dhamma talk explaining his own tradition.” ",
  "mn76:5.13": "“Well then, Sandaka, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn76:5.14": "“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Sandaka. ",
  "mn76:5.15": "Venerable Ānanda said this: ",
  "mn76:6.1": "“Sandaka, these things have been explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: four ways that negate the spiritual life, and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the system of the skillful teaching.” ",
  "mn76:6.2": "“But worthy Ānanda, what are the four ways that negate the spiritual life, and the four kinds of unreliable spiritual life?” ",
  "mn76:7.1": "“Sandaka, take a certain teacher who has this doctrine and view: ",
  "mn76:7.2": "‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight. ",
  "mn76:7.3": "This person is made up of the four principal states. When they die, the earth in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of earth. The water in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of water. The fire in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of fire. The air in their body progresses and proceeds to the substance of air. The faculties are transferred to space. ",
