  "mn56:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn56:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. ",
  "mn56:2.1": "At that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics. ",
  "mn56:2.2": "Then the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī wandered for alms in Nāḷandā. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to Pāvārika’s mango grove. There he approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn56:2.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side. The Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn56:2.4": "“There are seats, Tapassī. Please sit if you wish.” ",
  "mn56:3.1": "When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat to one side. ",
  "mn56:3.2": "The Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn56:3.3": "“Tapassī, how many kinds of deed does the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan describe for performing bad deeds?” ",
  "mn56:3.4": "“Reverend Gotama, the Jain Ñātika doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘deeds’. ",
  "mn56:3.5": "He usually speaks in terms of ‘rods’.” ",
  "mn56:3.6": "“Then how many kinds of rod does the Jain Ñātika describe for performing bad deeds?” ",
  "mn56:3.7": "“The Jain Ñātika describes three kinds of rod for performing bad deeds: ",
  "mn56:3.8": "the physical rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod.” ",
  "mn56:3.9": "“But are these kinds of rod all distinct from each other?” ",
  "mn56:3.10": "“Yes, each is quite distinct.” ",
  "mn56:3.11": "“Of the three rods thus analyzed and differentiated, which rod does the Jain Ñātika describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: the physical rod, the verbal rod, or the mental rod?” ",
  "mn56:3.12": "“The Jain Ñātika describes the physical rod as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.” ",
  "mn56:3.13": "“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?” ",
  "mn56:3.14": "“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.” ",
  "mn56:3.15": "“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?” ",
  "mn56:3.16": "“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.” ",
  "mn56:3.17": "“Do you say the physical rod, Tapassī?” ",
  "mn56:3.18": "“I say the physical rod, Reverend Gotama.” ",
  "mn56:3.19": "Thus the Buddha made Dīgha Tapassī stand by this point up to the third time. ",
  "mn56:4.1": "When this was said, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn56:4.2": "“But Reverend Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for performing bad deeds?” ",
  "mn56:4.3": "“Tapassī, the Realized One doesn’t usually speak in terms of ‘rods’. ",
  "mn56:4.4": "He usually speaks in terms of ‘deeds’.” ",
  "mn56:4.5": "“Then how many kinds of deed do you describe for performing bad deeds?” ",
  "mn56:4.6": "“I describe three kinds of deed for performing bad deeds: ",
  "mn56:4.7": "physical deeds, verbal deeds, and mental deeds.” ",
  "mn56:4.8": "“But are these kinds of deed all distinct from each other?” ",
  "mn56:4.9": "“Yes, each is quite distinct.” ",
  "mn56:4.10": "“Of the three deeds thus analyzed and differentiated, which deed do you describe as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds: physical deeds, verbal deeds, or mental deeds?” ",
  "mn56:4.11": "“I describe mental deeds as being the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much physical deeds or verbal deeds.” ",
  "mn56:4.12": "“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?” ",
  "mn56:4.13": "“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.” ",
  "mn56:4.14": "“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?” ",
  "mn56:4.15": "“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.” ",
  "mn56:4.16": "“Do you say mental deeds, Reverend Gotama?” ",
  "mn56:4.17": "“I say mental deeds, Tapassī.” ",
  "mn56:4.18": "Thus the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī made the Buddha stand by this point up to the third time, after which he got up from his seat and went to see the Jain Ñātika. ",
  "mn56:5.1": "Now at that time the Jain Ñātika was sitting together with a large assembly of Bālaki laypeople headed by Upāli. ",
  "mn56:5.2": "The Jain Ñātika saw Dīgha Tapassī coming off in the distance ",
  "mn56:5.3": "and said to him, ",
  "mn56:5.4": "“So, Tapassī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” ",
  "mn56:5.5": "“Just now, sir, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.” ",
  "mn56:5.6": "“But did you have some discussion with him?” ",
  "mn56:5.7": "“I did.” ",
  "mn56:5.8": "“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?” ",
  "mn56:5.9": "Then Dīgha Tapassī informed the Jain Ñātika of all they had discussed. ",
  "mn56:6.1": "When he had spoken, the Jain Ñātika said to him, ",
  "mn56:6.2": "“Good, good, Tapassī! ",
  "mn56:6.3": "Dīgha Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions. ",
  "mn56:6.4": "For how impressive is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod? ",
  "mn56:6.5": "Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod.” ",
  "mn56:7.1": "When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him, ",
  "mn56:7.2": "“Good, sir! Well done, Dīgha Tapassī! ",
  "mn56:7.3": "The Honorable Tapassī has answered the ascetic Gotama like a learned disciple who rightly understands their teacher’s instructions. ",
  "mn56:7.4": "For how significant is the measly mental rod when compared with the solid physical rod? ",
  "mn56:7.5": "Rather, the physical rod is the most blameworthy for performing bad deeds, not so much the verbal rod or the mental rod. ",
  "mn56:7.6": "I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine regarding this point. ",
  "mn56:7.7": "If he stands by the position that he stated to Dīgha Tapassī, I’ll take him on in debate and drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong man would grab a fleecy sheep and drag it to and fro and round about! ",
  "mn56:7.8": "Taking him on in debate, I’ll drag him to and fro and round about, like a strong brewer’s worker would toss a large brewer’s sieve into a deep lake, grab it by the corners, and drag it to and fro and round about! ",
  "mn56:7.9": "Taking him on in debate, I’ll shake him down and about and give him a beating, like a strong brewer’s mixer would grab a strainer by the corners and shake it down and about, and give it a beating! ",
  "mn56:7.10": "I’ll play a game of hemp-washing with the ascetic Gotama, like a sixty-year-old elephant would plunge into a deep lotus pond and play a game of hemp-washing! ",
  "mn56:7.11": "Sir, I’d better go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point.” ",
  "mn56:7.12": "“Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point. ",
  "mn56:7.13": "For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.” ",
  "mn56:8.1": "When he said this, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika, ",
  "mn56:8.2": "“Sir, I don’t believe it’s a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. ",
  "mn56:8.3": "For the ascetic Gotama is deceitful. He knows a conversion trick, and uses it to convert the disciples of other religions.” ",
  "mn56:8.4": "“It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that Upāli could become Gotama’s disciple. ",
  "mn56:8.5": "But it is possible that Gotama could become Upāli’s disciple. ",
  "mn56:8.6": "Go, householder, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine on this point. ",
  "mn56:8.7": "For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.” ",
  "mn56:9.1": "For a second time … ",
  "mn56:9.2": "and a third time, Dīgha Tapassī said to the Jain Ñātika, ",
  "mn56:9.3": "“Sir, I don’t believe it’s a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. ",

  "mn56:9.8": "For either I should do so, or Dīgha Tapassī, or you.” ",
  "mn56:9.9": "“Yes, sir,” replied the householder Upāli to the Jain Ñātika. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, ",
  "mn56:9.10": "“Sir, did the Jain ascetic Dīgha Tapassī come here?” ",
  "mn56:9.11": "“He did, householder.” ",
  "mn56:9.12": "“But did you have some discussion with him?” ",
  "mn56:9.13": "“I did.” ",
  "mn56:9.14": "“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?” ",
  "mn56:9.15": "Then the Buddha informed Upāli of all they had discussed. ",
  "mn56:10.1": "When he said this, the householder Upāli said to him, ",

  "mn56:10.7": "“I will debate on the basis of truth, sir. ",
  "mn56:10.8": "Let us have some discussion about this.” ",
  "mn56:11.1": "“What do you think, householder? ",
  "mn56:11.2": "Take a Jain ascetic who is sick, suffering, gravely ill. They turn down cold water and use only hot water. ",
  "mn56:11.3": "Not getting cold water, they might die. ",
  "mn56:11.4": "Now, where does the Jain Ñātika say they would be reborn?” ",
  "mn56:11.5": "“Sir, there are gods called ‘mind-bound’. They would be reborn there. ",
  "mn56:11.6": "Why is that? ",
  "mn56:11.7": "Because they died with mental attachment.” ",
  "mn56:11.8": "“Think about it, householder! You should think before answering. ",
  "mn56:11.9": "What you said before and what you said after don’t match up. ",

  "mn56:12.2": "Take a Jain ascetic who is restrained in all that is to be restrained, is bridled in all that is to be restrained, has shaken off evil in all that is to be restrained, and is curbed in all that is to be restrained. ",
  "mn56:12.3": "When going out and coming back they injure many little creatures. ",
  "mn56:12.4": "Now, what result does the Jain Ñātika say they would incur?” ",
  "mn56:12.5": "“Sir, the Jain Ñātika says that unintentional acts are not very blameworthy.” ",

  "mn56:12.7": "“Then they are very blameworthy.” ",
  "mn56:12.8": "“But where does the Jain Ñātika say that intention is classified?” ",

  "mn56:15.4": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",

  "mn56:18.1": "Then the Buddha taught the householder Upāli step by step, with ",
  "mn56:18.2": "a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. ",
  "mn56:18.3": "And when he knew that Upāli’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: ",

  "mn56:18.5": "Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, ",

  "mn56:18.7": "“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” ",
  "mn56:18.8": "Then Upāli saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. ",
  "mn56:18.9": "He said to the Buddha, “Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” ",
  "mn56:18.10": "“Please, householder, go at your convenience.” ",
  "mn56:19.1": "And then the householder Upāli approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went back to his own home, where he addressed the gatekeeper, ",

  "mn56:19.8": "“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. ",
  "mn56:20.1": "Dīgha Tapassī heard that ",

  "mn56:21.10": "Sir, I couldn’t get you to accept that it wasn’t a good idea for the householder Upāli to rebut the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. ",

  "mn56:22.14": "Upāli said to him, “Well, then, my good gatekeeper, prepare seats in the hall of the middle gate.” ",

  "mn56:22.16": "“Sir, seats have been prepared in the hall of the middle gate. ",
  "mn56:22.17": "Please go at your convenience.” ",
  "mn56:23.1": "Then Upāli went to the hall of the middle gate, where he sat on the highest and finest seat. He addressed the gatekeeper, ",
  "mn56:23.2": "“Well then, my good gatekeeper, go to the Jain Ñātika and say to him: ",

  "mn56:23.5": "“Yes, sir,” replied the gatekeeper. He went to the Jain Ñātika and relayed what was said. ",
  "mn56:23.6": "",
  "mn56:23.7": "",

  "mn56:24.2": "Previously, when Upāli saw the Jain Ñātika coming, he would go out to greet him and, having wiped off the highest and finest seat with his upper robe, he would embrace him and sit him down. ",
  "mn56:24.3": "But today, having seated himself on the highest and finest seat, he said to the Jain Ñātika, ",
  "mn56:24.4": "“There are seats, sir. ",
  "mn56:24.5": "Please sit if you wish.” ",
  "mn56:25.1": "When he said this, the Jain Ñātika said to him: ",
  "mn56:25.2": "“You’re mad, householder! You’re a moron! ",
  "mn56:25.3": "You said: ‘I’ll go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine. ",
  "mn56:25.4": "Suppose a man went to deliver a pair of testicles, but came back castrated. Or they went to deliver eyes, but came back blinded. ",
  "mn56:25.5": "In the same way, you said: ‘I’ll go and refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine.’ But you come back caught in the vast net of his doctrine. ",
  "mn56:25.6": "You’ve been converted by the ascetic Gotama’s conversion trick!” ",
  "mn56:26.1": "“Sir, this conversion trick is excellent. ",

  "mn56:26.7": "For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. ",
  "mn56:27.1": "Once upon a time there was an old brahmin, elderly and senior. His wife was a young brahmin lady who was pregnant and about to give birth. ",
  "mn56:27.2": "Then she said to the brahmin, ",
  "mn56:27.3": "‘Go, brahmin, buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’ ",
  "mn56:27.4": "When she said this, the brahmin said to her, ",
  "mn56:27.5": "‘Wait, my dear, until you give birth. ",
  "mn56:27.6": "If your child is a boy, I’ll buy you a male monkey, ",

  "mn56:27.10": "‘Go, brahmin, buy a baby monkey from the market and bring it back so it can be a playmate for my child.’ ",
  "mn56:27.11": "Then that brahmin, because of his love for the brahmin lady, bought a male baby monkey at the market, brought it to her, and said, ",
  "mn56:27.12": "‘I’ve bought this male baby monkey for you so it can be a playmate for your child.’ ",
  "mn56:27.13": "When he said this, she said to him, ",

  "mn56:27.19": "‘Sir, this monkey can endure a dying, but not a pounding or a pressing.’ ",
  "mn56:27.20": "In the same way, the doctrine of the foolish Jains looks fine initially—for fools, not for the astute—but can’t endure being scrutinized or pressed. ",
  "mn56:27.21": "Then some time later that brahmin took a new pair of garments to Rattapāṇi the dyer and said, ",

  "mn56:27.23": "When he said this, Rattapāṇi said to him, ",
  "mn56:27.24": "‘Sir, this pair of garments can endure a dying, a pounding, and a pressing.’ ",
  "mn56:27.25": "In the same way, the doctrine of the Buddha looks fine initially—for the astute, not for fools—and it can endure being scrutinized and pressed.” ",
