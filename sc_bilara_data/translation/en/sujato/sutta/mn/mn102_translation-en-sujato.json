  "mn102:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn102:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn102:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn102:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn102:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn102:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn102:2.1": "“Mendicants, there are some ascetics and brahmins who speculate and theorize about the final end, and assert various hypotheses concerning the final end. ",
  "mn102:2.2": "Some propose this: ‘The self is percipient and healthy after death.’ ",
  "mn102:2.3": "",
  "mn102:2.4": "Some propose this: ‘The self is non-percipient and healthy after death.’ ",
  "mn102:2.5": "",
  "mn102:2.6": "Some propose this: ‘The self is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death.’ ",
  "mn102:2.7": "",
  "mn102:2.8": "But some assert the annihilation, eradication, and nonexistence of an existing being, while others propose extinguishment in this life. ",
  "mn102:2.9": "Thus they assert an existent self that is free of disease after death; or they assert the annihilation of an existing being; while some propose extinguishment in this life. ",
  "mn102:2.10": "In this way five become three, and three become five. ",
  "mn102:2.11": "This is the summary recital of the five and three. ",
  "mn102:3.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception. Or some among those who go beyond this propose universal consciousness, limitless and imperturbable. ",
  "mn102:4.1": "The Realized One understands this as follows. ",
  "mn102:4.2": "There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. Or they describe it as of unified perception, or of diverse perception, or of limited perception, or of limitless perception. ",
  "mn102:4.3": "",
  "mn102:4.4": "Or some, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, propose the dimension of nothingness, limitless and imperturbable. They declare that this is the purest, highest, best, and supreme of all those perceptions, whether of form or of formlessness or of unity or of diversity. ",
  "mn102:4.5": "‘That much is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—<em>that</em> is real.’ ",
  "mn102:4.6": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that. ",
  "mn102:5.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. ",
  "mn102:6.1": "So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death. ",
  "mn102:6.2": "Why is that? ",
  "mn102:6.3": "Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart, and that the state of non-perception is peaceful and sublime. ",
  "mn102:7.1": "The Realized One understands this as follows. ",
  "mn102:7.2": "There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. ",
  "mn102:7.3": "But if any ascetic or brahmin should say this: ",
  "mn102:7.4": "‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’ ",
  "mn102:7.5": "That is not possible. ",
  "mn102:7.6": "‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—<em>that</em> is real.’ ",
  "mn102:7.7": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that. ",
  "mn102:8.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death describe it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. ",
  "mn102:9.1": "So they reject those who assert a self that is percipient and healthy after death, as well as those who assert a self that is non-percipient and healthy after death. ",
  "mn102:9.2": "Why is that? ",
  "mn102:9.3": "Because they believe that perception is a disease, a boil, a dart; that non-perception is a stupor; and that the state of neither perception nor non-perception is peaceful and sublime. ",

  "mn102:10.1": "The Realized One understands this as follows. ",
  "mn102:10.2": "There are ascetics and brahmins who assert a self that is neither percipient nor non-percipient and healthy after death, describing it as formed, or formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless. ",
  "mn102:10.3": "Some ascetics or brahmins assert the embracing of that dimension merely through the conditioned phenomena of what is able to be seen, heard, thought, and known. But that is said to be a disastrous approach. ",
  "mn102:10.4": "For that dimension is said to be not attainable by means of conditioned phenomena, ",
  "mn102:10.5": "but only with a residue of conditioned phenomena. ",
  "mn102:10.6": "‘All that is conditioned and crude. But there is the cessation of conditions—<em>that</em> is real.’ ",
  "mn102:10.7": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that. ",
  "mn102:11.1": "Now, the ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and nonexistence of an existing being reject those who assert a self that is free of disease after death, whether percipient or non-percipient or neither percipient non-percipient. ",
  "mn102:11.2": "Why is that? ",
  "mn102:11.3": "Because they think: ‘All of those ascetics and brahmins only assert their attachment to heading upstream: ",
  "mn102:11.4": "“After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!” ",
  "mn102:12.1": "Suppose a trader was going to market, thinking: ",
  "mn102:12.2": "“With this, that shall be mine! This way, I shall get that!” ",
  "mn102:12.3": "In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins seem to be like traders when they say: ",
  "mn102:12.4": "“After death we shall be like this! After death we shall be like that!”’ ",
  "mn102:12.5": "The Realized One understands this as follows. ",
  "mn102:12.6": "The ascetics and brahmins who assert the annihilation, eradication, and nonexistence of an existing being; from fear and disgust with substantial reality, they just keep running and circling around substantial reality. ",
  "mn102:12.7": "Suppose a hound on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar. It would just keeping running and circling around that post or pillar. ",
  "mn102:12.8": "In the same way, those ascetics and brahmins, from fear and disgust with substantial reality, just keep running and circling around substantial reality. ",

  "mn102:12.10": "Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that. ",
  "mn102:13.1": "Whatever ascetics and brahmins speculate and theorize about the final end, and propose various hypotheses concerning the final end, all of them propose one or other of these five theses. ",
  "mn102:14.1": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the first beginning, and propose various hypotheses concerning the first beginning. They propose the following, each insisting that theirs is the only truth and that everything else is wrong. ",
  "mn102:14.2": "‘The self and the cosmos are eternal.’ ",
