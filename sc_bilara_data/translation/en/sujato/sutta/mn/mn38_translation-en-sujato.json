  "mn38:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn38:2.1": "Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following harmful misconception: ",
  "mn38:2.2": "“As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” ",
  "mn38:3.1": "Several mendicants heard this rumour. ",

  "mn38:3.7": "“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” ",
  "mn38:3.8": "Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him, ",
  "mn38:3.9": "“Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. ",
  "mn38:3.10": "In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated, since without a cause, consciousness does not come to be.” ",
  "mn38:3.11": "But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on it. ",
  "mn38:3.12": "",
  "mn38:4.1": "When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

  "mn38:5.4": "“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti and said to him, ",

  "mn38:5.8": "‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?” ",
  "mn38:5.9": "“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.” ",
  "mn38:5.10": "“Sāti, what is that consciousness?” ",
  "mn38:5.11": "“Sir, he is the one who speaks, the one who knows, who experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms.” ",
  "mn38:5.12": "“Futile man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way? ",
  "mn38:5.13": "Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause? ",
  "mn38:5.14": "But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and brim with much wickedness. ",
  "mn38:5.15": "This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.” ",

  "mn38:6.6": "When this was said, Sāti sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. ",

  "mn38:7.3": "“No, sir. ",
