  "mn97:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "mn97:2.1": "Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. ",
  "mn97:2.2": "Then a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in Rājagaha went to the Southern Hills, where he approached Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn97:2.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him, ",
  "mn97:2.4": "“Reverend, I hope the Buddha is healthy and strong?” ",
  "mn97:2.5": "“He is, reverend.” ",
  "mn97:2.6": "“And I hope that the mendicant Saṅgha is healthy and strong.” ",
  "mn97:2.7": "“It is.” ",
  "mn97:2.8": "“Reverend, at the rice checkpoint at the city gate there is a brahmin named Dhanañjāni. ",
  "mn97:2.9": "I hope that he is healthy and strong?” ",
  "mn97:2.10": "“He too is well.” ",
  "mn97:2.11": "“But is he diligent?” ",
  "mn97:2.12": "“How could he possibly be diligent? ",
  "mn97:2.13": "Dhanañjāni robs the brahmins and householders in the name of the king, and he robs the king in the name of the brahmins and householders. ",
  "mn97:2.14": "His wife, a lady of faith who he married from a family of faith, has passed away. ",
  "mn97:2.15": "And he has taken a new wife who has no faith.” ",
  "mn97:2.16": "“Oh, it’s bad news ",
  "mn97:2.17": "to hear that Dhanañjāni is negligent. ",
  "mn97:2.18": "Hopefully, some time or other I’ll get to meet him, and we can have a discussion.” ",
  "mn97:3.1": "When Sāriputta had stayed in the Southern Hills as long as he pleased, he set out for Rājagaha. ",
  "mn97:3.2": "Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha, ",
  "mn97:3.3": "where he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "mn97:4.1": "Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. ",
  "mn97:4.2": "Now at that time Dhanañjāni was having his cows milked in a cow-shed outside the city. ",
  "mn97:4.3": "Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he approached Dhanañjāni. ",
  "mn97:4.4": "Seeing Sāriputta coming off in the distance, ",
  "mn97:4.5": "Dhanañjāni went to him and said, ",
  "mn97:4.6": "“Here, worthy Sāriputta, drink some fresh milk before the meal time.” ",
  "mn97:4.7": "“Enough, brahmin, ",
  "mn97:4.8": "I’ve finished eating for today. ",
  "mn97:4.9": "I shall be at the root of that tree for the day’s meditation. ",
  "mn97:4.10": "Come see me there.” ",
  "mn97:4.11": "“Yes, worthy sir,” replied Dhanañjāni. ",
  "mn97:5.1": "When Dhanañjāni had finished breakfast he went to Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn97:5.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to him, ",
  "mn97:5.3": "“I hope you’re diligent, Dhanañjāni?” ",
  "mn97:5.4": "“How can I possibly be diligent, worthy Sāriputta? I have to provide for my mother and father, my wives and children, and my bondservants and workers. And I have to make the proper offerings to friends and colleagues, relatives and kin, guests, ancestors, deities, and king. And then this body must also be fattened and built up.” ",
  "mn97:6.1": "“What do you think, Dhanañjāni? ",
  "mn97:6.2": "Suppose someone was to behave in an unprincipled and unjust way for the sake of their parents. Because of this the wardens of hell would drag them to hell. ",

  "mn97:6.4": "“No, worthy Sāriputta. ",
