  "mn27:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn27:2.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Jānussoṇi drove out from Sāvatthī in the middle of the day in an all-white chariot drawn by mares. ",
  "mn27:2.2": "He saw the wanderer Pilotika coming off in the distance, ",
  "mn27:2.3": "and said to him, ",
  "mn27:2.4": "“So, worthy Vacchāyana, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” ",
  "mn27:2.5": "“Just now, good fellow, I’ve come from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.” ",
  "mn27:2.6": "“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?” ",
  "mn27:2.7": "“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? ",
  "mn27:2.8": "You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.” ",
  "mn27:2.9": "“Mister Vacchāyana praises the ascetic Gotama with high praise indeed.” ",
  "mn27:2.10": "“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama? ",
  "mn27:2.11": "He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.” ",
  "mn27:2.12": "“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?” ",
  "mn27:3.1": "“Suppose that a skilled bull elephant tracker were to enter a bull elephant wood. ",
  "mn27:3.2": "There he’d see a large elephant’s footprint, long and broad. ",
  "mn27:3.3": "He would come to the conclusion, ",
  "mn27:3.4": "‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ ",
  "mn27:3.5": "In the same way, because I saw four footprints of the ascetic Gotama I came to the conclusion, ",
  "mn27:3.6": "‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ ",
  "mn27:4.1": "What four? ",
  "mn27:4.2": "Firstly, I see some clever aristocrats who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. ",
  "mn27:4.3": "They hear, ",
  "mn27:4.4": "‘So, gentlemen, that ascetic Gotama will come down to such and such village or town.’ ",
  "mn27:4.5": "They formulate a question, thinking, ",
  "mn27:4.6": "‘We’ll approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him this question. ",
  "mn27:4.7": "If he answers like this, we’ll refute him like that; ",
  "mn27:4.8": "and if he answers like that, we’ll refute him like this.’ ",
  "mn27:4.9": "When they hear that ",
  "mn27:4.10": "he has come down ",
  "mn27:4.11": "they approach him. ",
  "mn27:4.12": "The ascetic Gotama educates, encourages, fires up, and inspires them with a Dhamma talk. ",
  "mn27:4.13": "They don’t even get around to asking their question to the ascetic Gotama, so how could they refute his answer? ",
  "mn27:4.14": "Invariably, they become his disciples. ",
  "mn27:4.15": "When I saw this first footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion, ",
  "mn27:4.16": "‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ ",
  "mn27:5.1": "Furthermore, I see some clever brahmins … ",

  "mn27:7.11": "Invariably, they ask the ascetic Gotama for the chance to go forth. ",
  "mn27:7.12": "And he gives them the going-forth. ",
  "mn27:7.13": "Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, they realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn27:7.14": "They say, ",
  "mn27:7.15": "‘We were almost lost! We almost perished! ",
  "mn27:7.16": "For we used to claim that we were ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones, but we were none of these things. ",
  "mn27:7.17": "But now we really are ascetics, brahmins, and perfected ones!’ ",
  "mn27:7.18": "When I saw this fourth footprint of the ascetic Gotama, I came to the conclusion, ",
  "mn27:7.19": "‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ ",

  "mn27:7.21": "‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’” ",
  "mn27:8.1": "When he had spoken, Jānussoṇi got down from his chariot, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: ",
  "mn27:8.2": "“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! ",

  "mn27:9.7": "listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn27:9.8": "“Yes, worthy sir,” Jānussoṇi replied. ",
  "mn27:9.9": "The Buddha said this: ",

  "mn27:10.5": "Why not? ",

  "mn27:10.7": "",
  "mn27:10.8": "They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces high up. ",
  "mn27:10.9": "A skilled bull elephant tracker does not yet come to the conclusion, ",
  "mn27:10.10": "‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ ",
  "mn27:10.11": "Why not? ",

  "mn27:10.13": "",
  "mn27:10.14": "They keep following the track until they see a big footprint, long and broad, and traces and tusk-marks high up. ",

  "mn27:10.16": "‘This must be a big bull elephant.’ ",

  "mn27:11.1": "In the same way, brahmin, a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. ",
  "mn27:11.2": "He realizes with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",

  "mn27:13.1": "Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings. ",
  "mn27:13.2": "They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. ",
  "mn27:13.3": "They give up unchastity. They are chaste, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. ",
  "mn27:13.4": "They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words. ",
  "mn27:13.5": "They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided and support those who are united, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. ",
  "mn27:13.6": "They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. ",
  "mn27:13.7": "They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. ",
