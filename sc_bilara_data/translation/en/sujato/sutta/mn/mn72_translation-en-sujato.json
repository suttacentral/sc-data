  "mn72:2.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: ",

  "mn72:19.18": "“It doesn’t apply, worthy Gotama. The fire depended on grass and logs as fuel. When that runs out, and no more fuel is added, the fire is reckoned to have become quenched due to lack of fuel.” ",
  "mn72:20.1": "“In the same way, Vaccha, any form by which a realized one might be described has been given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. ",

  "mn72:21.4": "After some time it would be rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, pure, and consolidated in the core. ",
  "mn72:21.5": "In the same way, worthy Gotama’s dispensation is rid of branches and foliage, bark and shoots, and softwood, pure, and consolidated in the core. ",
