  "mn130:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn130:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn130:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn130:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn130:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn130:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn130:2.1": "“Mendicants, suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro. ",
  "mn130:2.2": "In the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, or among humans. These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm, the animal realm, or in a lower realm, a bad destination, a world of misery, hell.’ ",
  "mn130:3.1": "Then the wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying, ",
  "mn130:3.2": "‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family. ",
  "mn130:3.3": "May Your Majesty punish them!’ ",
  "mn130:3.4": "Then King Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first messenger of the gods. ",
  "mn130:3.5": "‘Mister, did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’ ",
  "mn130:3.6": "He says, ",
  "mn130:3.7": "‘I saw nothing, sir.’ ",
  "mn130:4.1": "Then King Yama says, ",
  "mn130:4.2": "‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a little baby collapsed in their own urine and feces?’ ",
  "mn130:4.3": "He says, ",
  "mn130:4.4": "‘I saw that, sir.’ ",
  "mn130:4.5": "Then King Yama says, ",
  "mn130:4.6": "‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—",
  "mn130:4.7": "“I, too, am liable to be born. I’m not exempt from rebirth. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’ ",
  "mn130:4.8": "He says, ",
  "mn130:4.9": "‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’ ",
  "mn130:4.10": "Then King Yama says, ",
  "mn130:4.11": "‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. ",
  "mn130:4.12": "Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. ",
  "mn130:4.13": "That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ ",
  "mn130:5.1": "Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods. ",
  "mn130:5.2": "‘Mister, did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’ ",
  "mn130:5.3": "He says, ",
  "mn130:5.4": "‘I saw nothing, sir.’ ",

  "mn130:5.6": "‘Mister, did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a man—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy?’ ",
  "mn130:5.7": "He says, ",
  "mn130:5.8": "‘I saw that, sir.’ ",

  "mn130:6.6": "‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in their own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others?’ ",
  "mn130:6.7": "He says, ",
