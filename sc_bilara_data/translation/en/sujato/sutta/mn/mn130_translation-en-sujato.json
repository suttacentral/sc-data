  "mn130:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",

  "mn130:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn130:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn130:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn130:2.1": "“Mendicants, suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with clear eyes standing in between them would see humans entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro. ",
  "mn130:2.2": "In the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, or among humans. These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm, the animal realm, or in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ ",
  "mn130:3.1": "The wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying, ",
  "mn130:3.2": "‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family. ",
  "mn130:3.3": "May Your Majesty punish them!’ ",

  "mn130:4.13": "That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by ascetics and brahmins, or by the deities. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ ",
