  "mn100:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn100:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. ",
  "mn100:2.1": "Now at that time a brahmin lady named Dhanañjānī was residing at Caṇḍalakappa. She was devoted to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. ",
  "mn100:2.2": "Once, she tripped and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: ",
  "mn100:2.3": "“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! ",
  "mn100:2.4": "Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! ",
  "mn100:2.5": "Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” ",
  "mn100:3.1": "Now at that time the student Saṅgārava was residing in Caṇḍalakappa. He was young, newly tonsured; he was sixteen years old. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies and ritual performance, their phonology and word classification, and the testaments as fifth. He knew them word-by-word, and their grammar. He was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. ",
  "mn100:3.2": "Hearing Dhanañjānī’s exclamation, ",
  "mn100:3.3": "he said to her, ",
  "mn100:3.4": "“The brahmin lady Dhanañjānī is a disgrace! Though brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are found, she praises that shaveling, that fake ascetic.” ",
  "mn100:3.5": "“But dearest boy, you don’t understand the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom. ",
  "mn100:3.6": "If you did, you’d never think of abusing or insulting him.” ",
  "mn100:3.7": "“Well then, ma’am, let me know when the Buddha arrives in Caṇḍalakappa.” ",
  "mn100:3.8": "“I will, dearest,” she replied. ",
  "mn100:4.1": "And then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage in the Kosalan lands, arrived at Caṇḍalakappa, ",
  "mn100:4.2": "where he stayed in the mango grove of the Todeyya brahmins. ",
  "mn100:5.1": "Dhanañjānī heard that he had arrived. ",
  "mn100:5.2": "So she went to Saṅgārava and told him, adding, ",
  "mn100:5.3": "",
  "mn100:5.4": "“Please, dearest boy, go at your convenience.” ",
  "mn100:5.5": "“Yes, ma’am,” replied Saṅgārava. He went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn100:5.6": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: ",
  "mn100:6.1": "“Worthy Gotama, there are some ascetics and brahmins who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life. ",
  "mn100:6.2": "Where do you stand regarding these?” ",
  "mn100:7.1": "“I say there is a disparity among those who claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life having attained perfection and consummation of insight in this life. ",
  "mn100:7.2": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who are oral transmitters. ",
  "mn100:7.3": "Through oral transmission they claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life. ",
  "mn100:7.4": "For example, the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas. ",
  "mn100:7.5": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who solely by mere faith claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life. ",
  "mn100:7.6": "For example, those who rely on logic and inquiry. ",
  "mn100:7.7": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who, having directly known for themselves the principle regarding teachings not learned before from another, claim to have mastered the fundamentals of the spiritual life. ",
  "mn100:7.8": "I am one of those. ",
  "mn100:8.1": "And here’s a way to understand that I am one of them. ",
  "mn100:9.1": "Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ",
  "mn100:9.2": "‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open. ",
  "mn100:9.3": "It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "mn100:9.4": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "mn100:9.5": "Some time later, while still with pristine black hair, blessed with youth, in the prime of life—though my mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces—I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn100:9.6": "Once I had gone forth I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn100:9.7": "‘Reverend Kālāma, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ ",
  "mn100:9.8": "Āḷāra Kālāma replied, ",
  "mn100:9.9": "‘Stay, venerable. ",
  "mn100:9.10": "This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn100:9.11": "I quickly memorized that teaching. ",
  "mn100:9.12": "As far as lip-recital and verbal repetition went, I spoke the doctrine of knowledge, the elder doctrine. I claimed to know and see, and so did others. ",
  "mn100:9.13": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:9.14": "‘It is not solely by mere faith that Āḷāra Kālāma declares: “I realize this teaching with my own insight, and live having achieved it.” ",
  "mn100:9.15": "Surely he meditates knowing and seeing this teaching.’ ",
  "mn100:10.1": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him: ",
  "mn100:10.2": "‘Reverend Kālāma, to what extent do you say you’ve realized this teaching with your own insight?’ ",
  "mn100:10.3": "When I said this, he declared the dimension of nothingness. ",
  "mn100:10.4": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:10.5": "‘It’s not just Āḷāra Kālāma who has faith, ",
  "mn100:10.6": "energy, ",
  "mn100:10.7": "mindfulness, ",
  "mn100:10.8": "immersion, ",
  "mn100:10.9": "and wisdom; I too have these things. ",
  "mn100:10.10": "Why don’t I make an effort to realize the same teaching that Āḷāra Kālāma says he has realized with his own insight?’ ",
  "mn100:10.11": "I quickly realized that teaching with my own insight, and lived having achieved it. ",
  "mn100:10.12": "So I approached Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him, ",
  "mn100:10.13": "‘Reverend Kālāma, is it up to this point that you realized this teaching with your own insight, and declare having achieved it?’ ",
  "mn100:10.14": "‘I have, reverend.’ ",
  "mn100:10.15": "‘I too have realized this teaching with my own insight up to this point, and live having achieved it.’ ",
  "mn100:10.16": "‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate ",
  "mn100:10.17": "to see a venerable such as yourself as one of our spiritual companions! ",
  "mn100:10.18": "So the teaching that I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it, you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it. ",
  "mn100:10.19": "The teaching that you’ve realized with your own insight, and dwell having achieved it, I’ve realized with my own insight, and declare having achieved it. ",
  "mn100:10.20": "So the teaching that I know, you know, and the teaching you know, I know. ",
  "mn100:10.21": "I am like you and you are like me. ",
  "mn100:10.22": "Come now, reverend! We should both lead this community together.’ ",
  "mn100:10.23": "And that is how my tutor Āḷāra Kālāma placed me, his pupil, on the same position as him, and honored me with high praise. ",
  "mn100:10.24": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:10.25": "‘This teaching doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the dimension of nothingness.’ ",
  "mn100:10.26": "Realizing that this teaching was inadequate, I left disappointed. ",
  "mn100:11.1": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. I approached Uddaka son of Rāma and said to him, ",
  "mn100:11.2": "‘Reverend, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.’ ",
  "mn100:11.3": "Uddaka replied, ",
  "mn100:11.4": "‘Stay, venerable. ",
  "mn100:11.5": "This teaching is such that a sensible person can soon realize their own tradition with their own insight and live having achieved it.’ ",

  "mn100:11.13": "When I said this, Uddaka son of Rāma declared the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. ",
  "mn100:11.14": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:11.15": "‘It’s not just Rāma who had faith, ",
  "mn100:11.16": "energy, ",
  "mn100:11.17": "mindfulness, ",
  "mn100:11.18": "immersion, ",
  "mn100:11.19": "and wisdom; I too have these things. ",

  "mn100:13.1": "I set out to discover what is skillful, seeking the supreme state of sublime peace. Traveling stage by stage in the Magadhan lands, I arrived at the town of Senā in Uruvelā. ",
  "mn100:13.2": "There I saw a delightful park, a lovely grove with a flowing river that was clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby was a village to resort to for alms. ",
  "mn100:13.3": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:13.4": "‘This park is truly delightful, a lovely grove with a flowing river that’s clean and charming, with smooth banks. And nearby there’s a village to resort to for alms. ",
  "mn100:13.5": "This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive.’ ",
  "mn100:13.6": "So I sat down right there, thinking: ",
  "mn100:13.7": "‘This is good enough for striving.’ ",
  "mn100:14.1": "And then these three similes, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to me. ",
  "mn100:14.2": "Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying in water. ",
  "mn100:14.3": "Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking ",
  "mn100:14.4": "to light a fire and produce heat. ",
  "mn100:14.5": "What do you think, Bhāradvāja? ",
  "mn100:14.6": "By drilling the stick against that green, sappy log lying in water, could they light a fire and produce heat?” ",
  "mn100:14.7": "“No, worthy Gotama. ",
  "mn100:14.8": "Why is that? ",
  "mn100:14.9": "Because it’s a green, sappy log, and it’s lying in the water. ",
  "mn100:14.10": "That person will eventually get weary and frustrated.” ",
  "mn100:14.11": "“In the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins who don’t live withdrawn in body and mind from sensual pleasures. They haven’t internally given up or stilled desire, affection, infatuation, thirst, and passion for sensual pleasures. Regardless of whether or not they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion, they are incapable of knowledge and vision, of supreme awakening. ",
  "mn100:14.12": "This was the first example that occurred to me. ",
  "mn100:15.1": "Then a second example occurred to me. ",
  "mn100:15.2": "Suppose there was a green, sappy log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water. ",

  "mn100:16.1": "Then a third example occurred to me. ",
  "mn100:16.2": "Suppose there was a dried up, withered log, and it was lying on dry land far from the water. ",
  "mn100:16.3": "Then a person comes along with a drill-stick, thinking ",

  "mn100:17.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:17.2": "‘Why don’t I, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, squeeze, squash, and scorch mind with mind?’ ",
  "mn100:17.3": "So that’s what I did, ",
  "mn100:17.4": "until sweat ran from my armpits. ",
  "mn100:17.5": "It was like when a strong man grabs a weaker man by the head or throat or shoulder and squeezes, squashes, and crushes them. ",
  "mn100:17.6": "In the same way, with teeth clenched and tongue pressed against the roof of my mouth, I squeezed, squashed, and crushed mind with mind until sweat ran from my armpits. ",
  "mn100:17.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",
  "mn100:18.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:18.2": "‘Why don’t I practice the breathless absorption?’ ",
  "mn100:18.3": "So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose. ",
  "mn100:18.4": "But then winds came out my ears making a severe noise, ",
  "mn100:18.5": "like the puffing of a blacksmith’s bellows. ",
  "mn100:18.6": "",
  "mn100:18.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",

  "mn100:19.3": "So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose. ",
  "mn100:19.4": "But then severe winds ground my head, ",

  "mn100:20.3": "So I cut off my breathing through my mouth and nose. ",
  "mn100:20.4": "But then I got a severe headache, ",

  "mn100:21.4": "But then severe winds carved up my belly, ",
  "mn100:21.5": "like a deft butcher or their apprentice was slicing my belly open with a sharp meat cleaver. ",
  "mn100:21.6": "",
  "mn100:21.7": "My energy was roused up and unflagging, and my mindfulness was established and lucid, but my body was disturbed, not tranquil, because I’d pushed too hard with that painful striving. ",

  "mn100:22.4": "But then there was a severe burning in my body, ",

  "mn100:23.1": "Then some deities saw me and said, ",
  "mn100:23.2": "‘The ascetic Gotama is dead.’ ",
  "mn100:23.3": "Others said, ",
  "mn100:23.4": "‘He’s not dead, but he’s dying.’ ",

  "mn100:24.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:24.2": "‘Why don’t I practice completely cutting off food?’ ",
  "mn100:24.3": "But deities came to me and said, ",
  "mn100:24.4": "‘Good fellow, don’t practice totally cutting off food. ",
  "mn100:24.5": "If you do, we’ll infuse heavenly nectar into your pores and you will live on that.’ ",
  "mn100:24.6": "",
  "mn100:24.7": "Then it occurred to me, ",

  "mn100:24.9": "",
  "mn100:24.10": "So I refused those deities, saying, ‘There’s no need.’ ",
  "mn100:25.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:25.2": "‘Why don’t I just take a little bit of food each time, a handful of broth made from mung beans, horse gram, chickpeas, or green gram?’ ",
  "mn100:25.3": "So that’s what I did, ",
  "mn100:25.4": "until my body became severely emaciated. ",
  "mn100:25.5": "Due to eating so little, my major and minor limbs became like the joints of an eighty-year-old or a dying man, ",
  "mn100:25.6": "my bottom became like a camel’s hoof, ",
  "mn100:25.7": "my vertebrae stuck out like beads on a string, ",
  "mn100:25.8": "and my ribs were as gaunt as the broken-down rafters on an old barn. ",
  "mn100:25.9": "Due to eating so little, the gleam of my eyes sank deep in their sockets, like the gleam of water sunk deep down a well. ",
  "mn100:25.10": "Due to eating so little, my scalp shriveled and withered like a green bitter-gourd in the wind and sun. ",
  "mn100:25.11": "Due to eating so little, the skin of my belly stuck to my backbone, so that when I tried to rub the skin of my belly I grabbed my backbone, and when I tried to rub my backbone I rubbed the skin of my belly. ",
  "mn100:25.12": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to urinate or defecate I fell face down right there. ",
  "mn100:25.13": "Due to eating so little, when I tried to relieve my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell out. ",
  "mn100:26.1": "Then some people saw me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama is black.’ ",
  "mn100:26.2": "Some said: ‘He’s not black, he’s brown.’ ",
  "mn100:26.3": "Some said: ‘He’s neither black nor brown. The ascetic Gotama has dingy skin.’ ",
  "mn100:26.4": "That’s how far the pure, bright complexion of my skin had been ruined by taking so little food. ",
  "mn100:27.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:27.2": "‘Whatever ascetics and brahmins have experienced painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings due to overexertion—whether in the past, future, or present—this is as far as it goes, no-one has done more than this. ",

  "mn100:27.4": "",
  "mn100:27.5": "But I have not achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones by this severe, grueling work. ",
  "mn100:27.6": "Could there be another path to awakening?’ ",
  "mn100:28.1": "Then it occurred to me, ",
  "mn100:28.2": "‘I recall sitting in the cool shade of a black plum tree while my father the Sakyan was off working. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn100:28.3": "Could that be the path to awakening?’ ",
  "mn100:28.4": "Stemming from that memory came the understanding: ",
