  "mn137:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn137:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn137:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn137:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn137:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn137:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn137:2.1": "“Mendicants, I shall teach you the analysis of the six sense fields. ",
  "mn137:2.2": "Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn137:2.3": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn137:2.4": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn137:3.1": "“‘The six interior sense fields should be understood. The six exterior sense fields should be understood. The six classes of consciousness should be understood. The six classes of contact should be understood. The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood. The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood. Therein, relying on this, give up that. The Noble One cultivates the establishment of mindfulness in three cases, by virtue of which they are a Teacher worthy to instruct a group. Of all meditation tutors, it is he that is called the supreme guide for those fit for training.’ ",
  "mn137:3.2": "This is the summary recital for the analysis of the six sense fields. ",
  "mn137:4.1": "‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:4.2": "That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
  "mn137:4.3": "There are the sense fields of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. ",
  "mn137:4.4": "‘The six interior sense fields should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:4.5": "That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. ",
  "mn137:5.1": "‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:5.2": "That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
  "mn137:5.3": "There are the sense fields of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and ideas. ",
  "mn137:5.4": "‘The six exterior sense fields should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:5.5": "That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. ",
  "mn137:6.1": "‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:6.2": "That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
  "mn137:6.3": "There are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness. ",
  "mn137:6.4": "‘The six classes of consciousness should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:6.5": "That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. ",
  "mn137:7.1": "‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:7.2": "That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
  "mn137:7.3": "There is contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. ",
  "mn137:7.4": "‘The six classes of contact should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:7.5": "That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. ",
  "mn137:8.1": "‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:8.2": "That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
  "mn137:8.3": "Seeing a sight with the eye, one is preoccupied with a sight that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity. ",
  "mn137:8.4": "Hearing a sound with the ear … ",
  "mn137:8.5": "Smelling an odor with the nose … ",
  "mn137:8.6": "Tasting a flavor with the tongue … ",
  "mn137:8.7": "Feeling a touch with the body … ",
  "mn137:8.8": "Becoming conscious of an idea with the mind, one is preoccupied with an idea that’s a basis for happiness or sadness or equanimity. ",
  "mn137:8.9": "So there are six preoccupations with happiness, six preoccupations with sadness, and six preoccupations with equanimity. ‘The eighteen mental preoccupations should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:8.10": "That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. ",
  "mn137:9.1": "‘The thirty-six positions of sentient beings should be understood.’ ",
  "mn137:9.2": "That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
  "mn137:9.3": "There are six kinds of domestic happiness and six kinds of renunciate happiness. There are six kinds of domestic sadness and six kinds of renunciate sadness. There are six kinds of domestic equanimity and six kinds of renunciate equanimity. ",

  "mn137:10.2": "There are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the worldly pleasures of the flesh. Happiness arises when you regard it as a gain to obtain such sights, or when you recollect sights you formerly obtained that have passed, ceased, and perished. ",

  "mn137:12.2": "There are sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasing, connected with the worldly pleasures of the flesh. Sadness arises when you regard it as a loss to lose such sights, or when you recollect sights you formerly lost that have passed, ceased, and perished. ",
  "mn137:12.3": "Such sadness is called domestic sadness. ",

Upon seeing this, you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations: ",
  "mn137:13.3": "‘Oh, when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today?’ When you give rise to yearning for the supreme liberations like this, sadness arises because of the yearning. ",
