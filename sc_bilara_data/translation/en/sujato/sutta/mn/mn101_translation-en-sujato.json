  "mn101:33.2": "They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. ",
  "mn101:33.3": "In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. ",
  "mn101:33.4": "When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. ",
  "mn101:34.1": "When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. ",
  "mn101:34.2": "If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. ",
  "mn101:34.3": "When they hear a sound with their ears … ",
  "mn101:34.4": "When they smell an odor with their nose … ",
  "mn101:34.5": "When they taste a flavor with their tongue … ",
  "mn101:34.6": "When they feel a touch with their body … ",
  "mn101:34.7": "When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. ",
  "mn101:34.8": "If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. ",
  "mn101:34.9": "When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves. ",
  "mn101:35.1": "They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. ",
  "mn101:36.1": "When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, ",
  "mn101:36.2": "they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. ",
  "mn101:36.3": "After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in front of them. ",
  "mn101:37.1": "Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. ",
  "mn101:37.2": "Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. ",
  "mn101:37.3": "Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. ",
  "mn101:37.4": "Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. ",
  "mn101:37.5": "Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. ",
  "mn101:38.1": "They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. ",
  "mn101:38.2": "Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn101:38.3": "That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful. ",
  "mn101:39.1": "Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn101:39.2": "That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful. ",
  "mn101:40.1": "Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",
  "mn101:40.2": "That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful. ",
  "mn101:41.1": "Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ",
  "mn101:41.2": "That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful. ",
  "mn101:42.1": "When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives. ",
  "mn101:42.2": "They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. ",
  "mn101:42.3": "That too is how exertion and striving is fruitful. ",
  "mn101:43.1": "When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. ",
  "mn101:43.2": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ",

  "mn101:45.2": "When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "mn101:45.3": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ ",
