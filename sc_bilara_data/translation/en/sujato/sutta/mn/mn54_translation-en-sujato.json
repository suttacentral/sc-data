  "mn54:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn54:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅguttarāpans, near the town of theirs named Āpaṇa. ",
  "mn54:2.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Āpaṇa for alms. ",
  "mn54:2.2": "He wandered for alms in Āpaṇa. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation. ",
  "mn54:2.3": "Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate. ",
  "mn54:3.1": "Potaliya the householder also approached that forest grove while going for a walk. He was well dressed in sarong and cloak, with parasol and sandals. Having plunged deep into it, he went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn54:3.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and the Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn54:3.3": "“There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.” ",
  "mn54:3.4": "When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he stayed silent. ",
  "mn54:3.5": "For a second time … ",
  "mn54:3.6": "and a third time the Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn54:3.7": "“There are seats, householder. Please sit if you wish.” ",
  "mn54:3.8": "When he said this, Potaliya was angry and upset. Thinking, “The ascetic Gotama addresses me as ‘householder’!” he said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn54:3.9": "“Worthy Gotama, it is neither proper nor appropriate for you to address me as ‘householder’.” ",
  "mn54:3.10": "“Well, householder, you have the features, attributes, and signs of a householder.” ",
  "mn54:3.11": "“Mister Gotama, it’s because I have turned down all work and cut off all business.” ",
  "mn54:3.12": "“Householder, in what way have you turned down all work and cut off all business?” ",
  "mn54:3.13": "“Worthy Gotama, all the money, grain, gold, and silver I used to have has been handed over to my children as their inheritance. And in this matter I do not advise or reprimand them, but live with nothing more than food and clothes. ",
  "mn54:3.14": "That’s how I have turned down all work and cut off all business.” ",
  "mn54:3.15": "“The cutting off of business as you describe it is one thing, householder, but the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training is quite different.” ",
  "mn54:3.16": "“But what, sir, is cutting off of business in the noble one’s training? ",
  "mn54:3.17": "Sir, please teach me this.” ",
  "mn54:3.18": "“Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn54:3.19": "“Yes, sir,” said Potaliya. ",
  "mn54:4.1": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn54:4.2": "“Householder, these eight things lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training. ",
  "mn54:4.3": "What eight? ",
  "mn54:4.4": "Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures. ",
  "mn54:4.5": "Stealing should be given up, relying on not stealing. ",
  "mn54:4.6": "Lying should be given up, relying on speaking the truth. ",
  "mn54:4.7": "Divisive speech should be given up, relying on speech that isn’t divisive. ",
  "mn54:4.8": "Greed and lust should be given up, relying on not being greedy and lustful. ",
  "mn54:4.9": "Blaming and insulting should be given up, relying on not blaming and not insulting. ",
  "mn54:4.10": "Anger and distress should be given up, relying on not being angry and distressed. ",
  "mn54:4.11": "Arrogance should be given up, relying on not being arrogant. ",
  "mn54:4.12": "These are the eight things—stated in brief without being analyzed in detail—that lead to the cutting off of business in the noble one’s training.” ",
  "mn54:5.1": "“Sir, please teach me these eight things in detail out of sympathy.” ",
  "mn54:5.2": "“Well then, householder, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn54:5.3": "“Yes, sir,” said Potaliya. ",
  "mn54:5.4": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn54:6.1": "“‘Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? ",
  "mn54:6.2": "It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ",
  "mn54:6.3": "‘I am practicing to give up and cut off the fetters that might cause me to kill living creatures. ",
  "mn54:6.4": "But if I were to kill living creatures, because of that I would reprimand myself; sensible people, after examination, would criticize me; and when my body breaks up, after death, I could expect to be reborn in a bad place. ",
  "mn54:6.5": "And killing living creatures is itself a fetter and a hindrance. ",
  "mn54:6.6": "The distressing and feverish defilements that might arise because of killing living creatures do not occur in someone who does not kill living creatures.’ ",
  "mn54:6.7": "‘Killing living creatures should be given up, relying on not killing living creatures.’ ",
