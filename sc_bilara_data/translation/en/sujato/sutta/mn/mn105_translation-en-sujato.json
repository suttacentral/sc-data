  "mn105:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. ",
  "mn105:2.1": "Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence: ",

  "mn105:5.7": "If the Realized One thinks ",
  "mn105:5.8": "he should teach them the Dhamma, ",
  "mn105:5.9": "but then certain futile men, having carefully planned a question, approach the Realized One and ask it, ",
  "mn105:5.10": "then the Realized One ",

  "mn105:6.4": "“Yes, sir,” replied Sunakkhatta. ",
  "mn105:6.5": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn105:7.1": "“Sunakkhatta, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. ",
  "mn105:7.2": "What five? ",
  "mn105:7.3": "Sights known by the eye, which are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. ",

  "mn105:8.1": "It’s possible that a certain individual person may be intent on worldly pleasures of the flesh. ",
  "mn105:8.2": "Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it rewarding. ",
  "mn105:8.3": "But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it rewarding. ",
