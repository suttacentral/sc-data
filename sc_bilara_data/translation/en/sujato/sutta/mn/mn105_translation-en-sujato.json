  "mn105:2.1": "Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence: ",

  "mn105:5.7": "If the Realized One thinks ",
  "mn105:5.8": "he should teach them the Dhamma, ",
  "mn105:5.9": "but then certain foolish men, having carefully planned a question, approach the Realized One and ask it, ",
  "mn105:5.10": "then the Realized One ",

  "mn105:8.1": "It’s possible that a certain individual may be intent on worldly pleasures of the flesh. ",
  "mn105:8.2": "Such an individual engages in pertinent conversation, thinking and considering in line with that. They associate with that kind of person, and they find it satisfying. ",
  "mn105:8.3": "But when talk connected with the imperturbable is going on they don’t want to listen. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. They don’t associate with that kind of person, and they don’t find it satisfying. ",
