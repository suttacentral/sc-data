  "mn8:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn8:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn8:2.1": "Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahācunda came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: ",
  "mn8:3.1": "“Sir, there are many different views that arise in the world ",
  "mn8:3.2": "connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos. ",
  "mn8:3.3": "How does a mendicant who is focusing on the starting point give up and let go of these views?” ",
  "mn8:3.4": "“Cunda, there are many different views that arise in the world ",
  "mn8:3.5": "connected with theories of self or with theories of the cosmos. ",
  "mn8:3.6": "A mendicant gives up and lets go of these views by truly seeing with right wisdom where they arise, where they settle in, and where they operate as: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ ",
  "mn8:4.1": "It’s possible that a certain mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, might enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn8:4.2": "They might think ",
  "mn8:4.3": "they’re practicing self-effacement. ",
  "mn8:4.4": "But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; ",
  "mn8:4.5": "they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’. ",
  "mn8:5.1": "It’s possible that some mendicant, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, might enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.

  "mn8:6.1": "It’s possible that some mendicant, with the fading away of rapture, might enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",
  "mn8:6.2": "They might think ",
  "mn8:6.3": "they’re practicing self-effacement. ",
  "mn8:6.4": "But in the training of the Noble One these are not called ‘self-effacement’; ",

  "mn8:7.1": "It’s possible that some mendicant, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, might enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ",

  "mn8:7.5": "they’re called ‘blissful meditations in this life’. ",
  "mn8:8.1": "It’s possible that some mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, might enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. ",
  "mn8:8.2": "They might think ",
  "mn8:8.3": "they’re practicing self-effacement. ",

  "mn8:13.0": "2. Giving Rise to the Thought ",
  "mn8:13.1": "Cunda, I say that even giving rise to the thought of skillful qualities is very helpful, let alone following that path in body and speech. ",
  "mn8:13.2": "That’s why you should give rise to the following thoughts. ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’ ",
  "mn8:13.3": "‘Others will kill living creatures, but here we will not kill living creatures.’ … ",
  "mn8:13.4": "‘Others will be attached to their own views, holding them tight, and refusing to let go, but here we will not be attached to our own views, not holding them tight, but will let them go easily.’ ",

  "mn8:16.0": "5. The Exposition by Extinguishment ",
  "mn8:16.1": "If you’re sinking in the mud yourself, Cunda, it is quite impossible for you to pull out someone else who is sinking in the mud. ",

  "mn8:17.1": "So, Cunda, I’ve taught the expositions by way of self-effacement, arising of thought, bypassing, going up, and extinguishing. ",
  "mn8:17.2": "Out of sympathy, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. ",
  "mn8:17.3": "Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Cunda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction.” ",
  "mn8:17.4": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn8:17.5": "Satisfied, Venerable Mahācunda approved what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn8:17.6": "Forty-four items have been stated, ",
