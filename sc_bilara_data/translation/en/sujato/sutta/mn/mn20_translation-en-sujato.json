  "mn20:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn20:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn20:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn20:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn20:2.1": "“Mendicants, a mendicant committed to the higher mind should focus on five subjects from time to time. ",
  "mn20:2.2": "What five? ",
  "mn20:3.1": "Take a mendicant who is focusing on some subject that gives rise to bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion. That mendicant should focus on some other subject connected with the skillful. ",
  "mn20:3.2": "As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. ",
  "mn20:3.3": "Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. ",
  "mn20:3.4": "It’s like a deft mason or their apprentice who’d knock out or extract a large peg with a finer peg. ",

  "mn20:4.1": "Now, suppose that mendicant is focusing on some other subject connected with the skillful, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should examine the drawbacks of those thoughts: ",
  "mn20:4.2": "‘So these thoughts are unskillful, they’re blameworthy, and they result in suffering.’ ",
  "mn20:4.3": "As they do so, those bad thoughts are given up and come to an end. ",
  "mn20:4.4": "Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. ",
  "mn20:4.5": "Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted. ",

  "mn20:4.8": "",
  "mn20:4.9": "",
  "mn20:5.1": "Now, suppose that mendicant is examining the drawbacks of those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should try to forget and ignore them. ",

  "mn20:5.3": "Their mind becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. ",
  "mn20:5.4": "Suppose there was a person with clear eyes, and some undesirable sights came into their range of vision. ",
  "mn20:5.5": "They’d just close their eyes or look away. ",

  "mn20:5.7": "",
  "mn20:6.1": "Now, suppose that mendicant is ignoring and forgetting about those thoughts, but bad, unskillful thoughts connected with desire, hate, and delusion keep coming up. They should focus on stopping the formation of thoughts. ",

  "mn20:6.6": "‘Why am I walking so quickly? ",
  "mn20:6.7": "Why don’t I slow down?’ ",
  "mn20:6.8": "So they’d slow down. ",
  "mn20:6.9": "They’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.10": "‘Why am I walking slowly? ",
  "mn20:6.11": "Why don’t I stand still?’ ",
  "mn20:6.12": "So they’d stand still. ",
  "mn20:6.13": "They’d think: ",
  "mn20:6.14": "‘Why am I standing still? ",
  "mn20:6.15": "Why don’t I sit down?’ ",

  "mn20:6.21": "And so that person would shun successively coarser postures and adopt more subtle ones. ",
  "mn20:6.22": "In the same way, a mendicant … those thoughts are given up and come to an end … ",
