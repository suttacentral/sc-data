  "mn25:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn25:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn25:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn25:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn25:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn25:2.1": "“Mendicants, a trapper doesn’t cast bait for deer thinking, ",
  "mn25:2.2": "‘May the deer, enjoying this bait, be healthy and in good condition. May they live long and prosper!’ ",
  "mn25:2.3": "A trapper casts bait for deer thinking, ",
  "mn25:2.4": "‘When these deer intrude on where I cast the bait, they’ll recklessly enjoy eating it. They’ll become indulgent, then they’ll become negligent, and then I’ll be able to do what I want with them on account of this bait.’ ",
  "mn25:3.1": "And indeed, the first herd of deer intruded on where the trapper cast the bait and recklessly enjoyed eating it. They became indulgent, then they became negligent, and then the trapper was able to do what he wanted with them on account of that bait. ",
  "mn25:3.2": "And that’s how the first herd of deer failed to get free from the trapper’s power. ",
  "mn25:4.1": "So then a second herd of deer thought up a plan, ",

  "mn25:4.4": "and failed to get free of the trapper’s power. ",
  "mn25:4.5": "Why don’t we avoid eating the bait altogether? Avoiding dangerous food, we can venture deep into a wilderness region and live there.’ ",
  "mn25:4.6": "And that’s just what they did. ",
  "mn25:4.7": "But when it came to the last month of summer, the grass and water ran out. Their bodies became much too thin, ",
  "mn25:4.8": "and they lost their strength and energy. ",
