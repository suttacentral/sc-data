  "mn46:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn46:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn46:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn46:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn46:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn46:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn46:2.1": "“Mendicants, sentient beings typically have the wish, desire, and hope: ",
  "mn46:2.2": "‘Oh, if only unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things would decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things would increase!’ ",
  "mn46:2.3": "But exactly the opposite happens to them. ",
  "mn46:2.4": "What do you take to be the reason for this?” ",
  "mn46:2.5": "“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” ",
  "mn46:2.6": "“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn46:2.7": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn46:2.8": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn46:3.1": "“Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen true persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
  "mn46:3.2": "They don’t know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster. ",
  "mn46:3.3": "So they cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they should. ",
  "mn46:3.4": "When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things increase, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things decrease. ",
  "mn46:3.5": "Why is that? ",
  "mn46:3.6": "Because that’s what it’s like for someone who doesn’t know. ",
  "mn46:4.1": "But a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen true persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the true persons. ",
  "mn46:4.2": "They know what practices they should cultivate and foster, and what practices they shouldn’t cultivate and foster. ",
  "mn46:4.3": "So they cultivate and foster practices they should, and don’t cultivate and foster practices they shouldn’t. ",
  "mn46:4.4": "When they do so, unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable things decrease, and likable, desirable, and agreeable things increase. ",
  "mn46:4.5": "Why is that? ",
