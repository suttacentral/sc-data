  "mn152:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Kajaṅgalā in a bamboo grove. ",
  "mn152:2.1": "Then the brahmin student Uttara, a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya, approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn152:2.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn152:2.3": "“Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?” ",
  "mn152:2.4": "“He does, Master Gotama.” ",
  "mn152:2.5": "“But how does he teach it?” ",
  "mn152:2.6": "“Master Gotama, it’s when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound. ",
  "mn152:2.7": "That’s how Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.” ",
  "mn152:2.8": "“In that case, Uttara, a blind person and a deaf person will have developed faculties ",
  "mn152:2.9": "according to what Pārāsariya says. ",
  "mn152:2.10": "For a blind person sees no sight with the eye and a deaf person hears no sound with the ear.” ",
  "mn152:2.11": "When he said this, Uttara sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. ",
  "mn152:3.1": "Knowing this, the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda, ",
  "mn152:3.2": "“Ānanda, the development of the faculties taught by Pārāsariya is quite different from the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One.” ",
  "mn152:3.3": "“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One. ",
  "mn152:3.4": "Let the Buddha teach the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” ",
  "mn152:3.5": "“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” ",
  "mn152:3.6": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "mn152:3.7": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn152:4.1": "“And how, Ānanda, is there the supreme development of the faculties in the training of the Noble One? ",
  "mn152:4.2": "When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them. ",
  "mn152:4.3": "They understand: ",
  "mn152:4.4": "‘Liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking have come up in me. ",
  "mn152:4.5": "That’s conditioned, coarse, and dependently originated. ",
  "mn152:4.6": "But this is peaceful and sublime, namely ",
  "mn152:4.7": "equanimity.’ ",
  "mn152:4.8": "Then the liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking that came up in them cease, ",
  "mn152:4.9": "and equanimity becomes stabilized. ",
  "mn152:4.10": "It’s like how a person with clear eyes might open their eyes then shut them; or might shut their eyes then open them. ",
  "mn152:4.11": "Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized. ",
  "mn152:4.12": "In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding sights known by the eye. ",
  "mn152:5.1": "Furthermore, when a mendicant hears a sound with their ears, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them. ",
  "mn152:5.2": "They understand: ",

  "mn152:6.11": "In the training of the Noble One this is called the supreme development of the faculties regarding smells known by the nose. ",
  "mn152:7.1": "Furthermore, when a mendicant tastes a flavor with their tongue, liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking come up in them. ",

  "mn152:7.9": "It’s like how a strong person who’s formed a glob of spit on the tip of their tongue could easily spit it out. ",
  "mn152:7.10": "Such is the speed, the swiftness, the ease with which any liking, disliking, and both liking and disliking at all that came up in them cease, and equanimity becomes stabilized. ",
