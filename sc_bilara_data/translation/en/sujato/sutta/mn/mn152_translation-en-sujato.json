  "mn152:2.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn152:2.3": "“Uttara, does Pārāsariya teach his disciples the development of the faculties?” ",
  "mn152:2.4": "“He does, worthy Gotama.” ",
  "mn152:2.5": "“But how does he teach it?” ",
  "mn152:2.6": "“Worthy Gotama, it’s when the eye sees no sight and the ear hears no sound. ",
  "mn152:2.7": "That’s how Pārāsariya teaches his disciples the development of the faculties.” ",
  "mn152:2.8": "“In that case, Uttara, a blind person and a deaf person will have developed faculties ",
  "mn152:2.9": "according to what Pārāsariya says. ",

  "mn152:4.5": "That’s conditioned, crude, and dependently originated. ",
  "mn152:4.6": "But this is peaceful and sublime, namely ",
  "mn152:4.7": "equanimity.’ ",
