  "mn28:2.4": "The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. ",
  "mn28:3.1": "And what is the noble truth of suffering? ",
  "mn28:3.2": "Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. ",
  "mn28:3.3": "And what are the five grasping aggregates? ",
