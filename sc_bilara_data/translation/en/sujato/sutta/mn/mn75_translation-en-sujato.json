  "mn75:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma, on a grass mat in the fire chamber of a brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan. ",
  "mn75:2.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kammāsadamma for alms. ",
  "mn75:2.2": "He wandered for alms in Kammāsadamma. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to a certain forest grove for the day’s meditation. ",
  "mn75:2.3": "Having plunged deep into it, he sat at the root of a certain tree to meditate. ",
  "mn75:3.1": "Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber. ",
  "mn75:3.2": "He saw the grass mat spread out there ",
  "mn75:3.3": "and asked the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan, ",
  "mn75:3.4": "“Worthy Bhāradvāja, who has this grass mat been spread out for? It looks like an ascetic’s bed.” ",
  "mn75:4.1": "“There is the ascetic Gotama, a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family. ",
  "mn75:4.2": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "mn75:4.3": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "mn75:4.4": "This bed has been spread for that worthy Gotama.” ",
  "mn75:5.1": "“Well, it’s a sad sight, worthy Bhāradvāja, ",
  "mn75:5.2": "a very sad sight indeed, ",
  "mn75:5.3": "to see a bed for the worthy Gotama, that baby-killer!” ",
  "mn75:5.4": "“Be careful what you say, Māgaṇḍiya, ",
  "mn75:5.5": "be careful what you say. ",
  "mn75:5.6": "Many astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics are devoted to the worthy Gotama. They’ve been guided by him in the noble system, the skillful teaching.” ",
  "mn75:5.7": "“Even if I was to see the worthy Gotama face to face, worthy Bhāradvāja, I would say to his face: ",
  "mn75:5.8": "‘The ascetic Gotama is a baby-killer.’ ",
  "mn75:5.9": "Why is that? ",
  "mn75:5.10": "For so it came to me while sleeping.” ",
  "mn75:5.11": "“If you don’t mind, I’ll tell the ascetic Gotama about this.” ",
  "mn75:5.12": "“Don’t worry, worthy Bhāradvāja. You may tell him exactly what I’ve said.” ",
  "mn75:6.1": "With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan and the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya. ",
  "mn75:6.2": "Coming out of retreat, he went to the brahmin’s fire chamber and sat on the grass mat. ",
  "mn75:6.3": "Then the brahmin of the Bhāradvāja clan went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn75:6.4": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn75:6.5": "“Bhāradvāja, did you have a discussion with the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya about this grass mat?” ",
  "mn75:6.6": "When he said this, the brahmin, shocked and awestruck, said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn75:6.7": "“I wanted to mention this very thing to the worthy Gotama, ",
  "mn75:6.8": "but you brought it up before I had a chance.” ",
  "mn75:7.1": "But this conversation between the Buddha and the brahmin was left unfinished. ",
  "mn75:7.2": "Then as the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya was going for a walk he approached that fire chamber. He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn75:7.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the Buddha said to him: ",
  "mn75:8.1": "“Māgaṇḍiya, the eye likes sights, it loves them and enjoys them. ",
  "mn75:8.2": "That’s been tamed, guarded, protected and restrained by the Realized One, and he teaches Dhamma for its restraint. ",

  "mn75:11.8": "“No, worthy Gotama. ",

  "mn75:13.8": "“No, worthy Gotama. ",

  "mn75:18.2": "Have you seen or heard of a king or a royal minister of the past, future, or present, amusing themselves supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, who—without giving up craving for sensual pleasures and dispelling passion for sensual pleasures—lives rid of thirst, their mind peaceful inside?” ",

  "mn75:25.7": "‘These are diseases, boils, and darts. ",
  "mn75:25.8": "And here is where diseases, boils, and darts cease without anything left over.’ ",
  "mn75:25.9": "When my grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. ",
  "mn75:25.10": "That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” ",
  "mn75:26.1": "When he said this, Māgaṇḍiya said to him, ",
  "mn75:26.2": "“Excellent, worthy Gotama! Excellent! ",
  "mn75:26.3": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, worthy Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "mn75:26.4": "I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",
  "mn75:26.5": "May I receive the going forth, the ordination in the worthy Gotama’s presence?” ",
  "mn75:27.1": "“Māgaṇḍiya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. ",
  "mn75:27.2": "However, I recognize individual differences in this matter.” ",
  "mn75:27.3": "“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” ",
  "mn75:28.1": "And the wanderer Māgaṇḍiya received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. ",
  "mn75:28.2": "Not long after his ordination, Venerable Māgaṇḍiya, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn75:28.3": "He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is nothing further for this place.” ",
  "mn75:28.4": "And Venerable Māgaṇḍiya became one of the perfected. "
