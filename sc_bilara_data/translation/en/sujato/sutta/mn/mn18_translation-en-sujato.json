  "mn18:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. ",
  "mn18:2.1": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms. ",
  "mn18:2.2": "He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood, ",
  "mn18:2.3": "plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation. ",
  "mn18:3.1": "Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan, while going for a walk, ",
  "mn18:3.2": "plunged deep into the Great Wood. He approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn18:3.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side leaning on his staff, and said to the Buddha, ",
  "mn18:3.4": "“What is the ascetic’s doctrine? What does he assert?” ",
  "mn18:4.1": "“Sir, my doctrine is such that one does not conflict with anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. And it is such that perceptions do not underlie the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without doubting, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state. ",
  "mn18:4.2": "That is my doctrine, and that is what I assert.” ",
  "mn18:5.1": "When he had spoken, Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head, waggled his tongue, raised his eyebrows until his brow puckered in three furrows, and he departed leaning on his staff. ",
  "mn18:6.1": "Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, sat down on the seat spread out, ",

  "mn18:7.2": "And how is it that perceptions do not underlie the Buddha, the brahmin who lives detached from sensual pleasures, without indecision, stripped of worry, and rid of craving for rebirth in this or that state?” ",
