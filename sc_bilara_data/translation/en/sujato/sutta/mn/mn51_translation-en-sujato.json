  "mn51:1.3": "Then Pessa the elephant driver’s son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to see the Buddha. When they had approached, Pessa bowed and sat down to one side. ",
  "mn51:1.4": "But the wanderer Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Buddha and stood to one side. ",
  "mn51:1.5": "He looked around the mendicant Saṅgha, who were so very silent, and said to the Buddha: ",
  "mn51:2.1": "“It’s incredible, worthy Gotama, it’s amazing! ",
  "mn51:2.2": "How the mendicant Saṅgha has been led to practice properly by the worthy Gotama! ",
  "mn51:2.3": "The perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas in the past or the future who lead the mendicant Saṅgha to practice properly at best do so ",

  "mn51:3.5": "",
  "mn51:3.6": "For in this mendicant Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their heart’s goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. ",
  "mn51:3.7": "And in this mendicant Saṅgha there are trainee mendicants who are consistently ethical, living consistently, alert, living alertly. ",
  "mn51:3.8": "They meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. ",
  "mn51:3.9": "What four? ",

  "mn51:6.6": "The individual who mortifies themselves and others does so even though both themselves and others want to be happy and recoil from pain. ",
  "mn51:6.7": "That’s why I don’t like the sound of that individual. ",
  "mn51:6.8": "The individual who doesn’t mortify either themselves or others—living without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine—does not torment themselves or others, both of whom want to be happy and recoil from pain. ",

  "mn51:6.10": "That’s why I like the sound of that individual. ",
  "mn51:6.11": "Well, now, sir, I must go. ",
  "mn51:6.12": "I have many duties, and much to do.” ",
  "mn51:6.13": "“Please, Pessa, go at your convenience.” ",
  "mn51:6.14": "And then Pessa the elephant driver’s son approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
  "mn51:7.1": "Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ",
  "mn51:7.2": "“Mendicants, Pessa the elephant driver’s son is astute. ",

  "mn51:7.9": "“Yes, sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn51:7.10": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn51:8.1": "“And what individual mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves? It’s when an individual goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared for them, or an invitation for a meal. ",
  "mn51:8.2": "They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who lives with a man; or where there’s a hound waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or beer or wine, and drink no fermented gruel. ",

  "mn51:8.5": "They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals. ",
  "mn51:8.6": "They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. ",
  "mn51:8.7": "They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. ",

  "mn51:8.12": "They’re devoted to ritual bathing three times a day, including the evening. ",
  "mn51:8.13": "And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. ",
  "mn51:8.14": "This is called an individual who mortifies themselves, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves. ",
  "mn51:9.1": "And what individual mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others? ",
  "mn51:9.2": "It’s when an individual is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, or poultry, a hunter or trapper, a fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher, a jailer, or someone with some other kind of cruel livelihood. ",
  "mn51:9.3": "This is called an individual who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others. ",
  "mn51:10.1": "And what individual mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others? ",
  "mn51:10.2": "It’s when an individual is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin. ",
  "mn51:10.3": "He has a new ceremonial hall built to the east of the citadel. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the hall with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest. ",
  "mn51:10.4": "There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass. ",
  "mn51:10.5": "The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the leftovers. ",
  "mn51:10.6": "He says: ",
  "mn51:10.7": "‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’ ",
  "mn51:10.8": "His bondservants, servants, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. ",
  "mn51:10.9": "This is called an individual who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others. ",
  "mn51:11.1": "And what individual doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, but lives without wishes, quenched, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine? ",
  "mn51:12.1": "It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. ",
  "mn51:12.2": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn51:12.3": "He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "mn51:13.1": "A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family. ",
  "mn51:13.2": "They gain faith in the Realized One ",
  "mn51:13.3": "and reflect: ",
  "mn51:13.4": "‘Life at home is cramped and dirty, life gone forth is wide open. ",
  "mn51:13.5": "It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "mn51:13.6": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "mn51:13.7": "After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn51:14.1": "Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of sympathy for all living beings. ",
  "mn51:14.2": "They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. ",

  "mn51:14.4": "They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and dependable, and don’t trick the world with their words. ",
  "mn51:14.5": "They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided and support those who are united, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. ",
  "mn51:14.6": "They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people. ",
  "mn51:14.7": "They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. ",

  "mn51:15.2": "They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. ",
  "mn51:15.3": "In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. ",

  "mn51:16.2": "If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. ",

  "mn51:18.1": "When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble contentment, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, ",
  "mn51:18.2": "they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. ",
  "mn51:19.1": "After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in their presence. ",

  "mn51:21.1": "As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn51:22.1": "And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",

They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. ",
  "mn51:25.1": "When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. ",
  "mn51:25.2": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings pass on according to their deeds. ",

  "mn51:27.3": "When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "mn51:27.4": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further for this place.’ ",
  "mn51:28.1": "This is called an individual who neither mortifies themselves or others, being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others. ",
