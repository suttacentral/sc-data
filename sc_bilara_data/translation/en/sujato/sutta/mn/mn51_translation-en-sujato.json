  "mn51:1.3": "Then Pessa the elephant driver’s son and Kandaraka the wanderer went to see the Buddha. When they had approached, Pessa bowed and sat down to one side. ",
  "mn51:1.4": "But the wanderer Kandaraka exchanged greetings with the Buddha and stood to one side. ",
  "mn51:1.5": "He looked around the mendicant Saṅgha, who were so very silent, and said to the Buddha: ",
  "mn51:2.1": "“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing! ",
  "mn51:2.2": "How the mendicant Saṅgha has been led to practice properly by Master Gotama! ",

  "mn51:3.5": "",
  "mn51:3.6": "For in this mendicant Saṅgha there are perfected mendicants, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. ",
  "mn51:3.7": "And in this mendicant Saṅgha there are trainee mendicants who are consistently ethical, living consistently, alert, living alertly. ",
  "mn51:3.8": "They meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. ",

  "mn51:6.10": "That’s why I like the sound of that person. ",
  "mn51:6.11": "Well, now, sir, I must go. ",
  "mn51:6.12": "I have many duties, and much to do.” ",
  "mn51:6.13": "“Please, Pessa, go at your convenience.” ",
  "mn51:6.14": "And then Pessa the elephant driver’s son approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",
  "mn51:7.1": "Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: ",
  "mn51:7.2": "“Mendicants, Pessa the elephant driver’s son is astute. ",

  "mn51:7.10": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn51:8.1": "“And what person mortifies themselves, committed to the practice of mortifying themselves? It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared for them, or an invitation for a meal. ",
  "mn51:8.2": "They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing.

  "mn51:8.12": "They’re committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening. ",
  "mn51:8.13": "And so they live committed to practicing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. ",
  "mn51:8.14": "This is called a person who mortifies themselves, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves. ",
  "mn51:9.1": "And what person mortifies others, committed to the practice of mortifying others? ",
  "mn51:9.2": "It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, or poultry, a hunter or trapper, a fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher, a jailer, or someone with some other kind of cruel livelihood. ",
  "mn51:9.3": "This is called a person who mortifies others, being committed to the practice of mortifying others. ",
  "mn51:10.1": "And what person mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others? ",
  "mn51:10.2": "It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin. ",
  "mn51:10.3": "He has a new temple built to the east of the city. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest. ",
  "mn51:10.4": "There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass. ",
  "mn51:10.5": "The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder. ",
  "mn51:10.6": "He says: ",
  "mn51:10.7": "‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’ ",
  "mn51:10.8": "His bondservants, employees, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. ",
  "mn51:10.9": "This is called a person who mortifies themselves and others, being committed to the practice of mortifying themselves and others. ",
  "mn51:11.1": "And what person doesn’t mortify either themselves or others, but lives without wishes, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine? ",
  "mn51:12.1": "It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. ",
  "mn51:12.2": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn51:12.3": "He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "mn51:13.1": "A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family. ",
  "mn51:13.2": "They gain faith in the Realized One ",
  "mn51:13.3": "and reflect: ",
  "mn51:13.4": "‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. ",
  "mn51:13.5": "It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. ",
  "mn51:13.6": "Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ ",
  "mn51:13.7": "After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. ",
  "mn51:14.1": "Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. ",

  "mn51:14.5": "They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. ",

  "mn51:15.2": "They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. ",
  "mn51:15.3": "In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. ",

  "mn51:16.2": "If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. ",

  "mn51:21.1": "As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn51:22.1": "And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",

They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. ",
  "mn51:25.1": "When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. ",
  "mn51:25.2": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ",

  "mn51:27.2": "Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. ",
  "mn51:27.3": "When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "mn51:27.4": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ ",
  "mn51:28.1": "This is called a person who neither mortifies themselves or others, being committed to the practice of not mortifying themselves or others. ",
