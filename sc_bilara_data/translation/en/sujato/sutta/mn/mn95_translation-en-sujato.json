  "mn95:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Opāsāda. ",
  "mn95:1.3": "He stayed in the Godswood of sal trees to the north of Opāsāda. ",
  "mn95:2.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī was living in Opāsāda. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal park endowed to a brahmin. ",
  "mn95:3.1": "The brahmins and householders of Opāsāda heard: ",
  "mn95:3.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Opāsāda together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He is staying in the Godswood to the north. ",
  "mn95:3.3": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "mn95:3.4": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those fit for training, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "mn95:3.5": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn95:3.6": "He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",
  "mn95:3.7": "It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "mn95:4.1": "Then, exiting Opāsāda, they formed into companies and headed north to the Godswood. ",
  "mn95:5.1": "Now at that time the brahmin Caṅkī had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. ",
  "mn95:5.2": "He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the Godswood, ",

  "mn95:10.1": "Then Caṅkī together with a large group of brahmins went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn95:10.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. ",
  "mn95:11.1": "Now at that time the Buddha was sitting engaged in some polite conversation together with some very senior brahmins. ",
  "mn95:11.2": "And the student Kāpaṭika was sitting in that assembly. He was young, tonsured, and sixteen years old.

  "mn95:11.9": "He’s a gentleman, learned and astute, who enunciates well. He is capable of debating with the worthy Gotama about this.” ",
  "mn95:12.1": "Then it occurred to the Buddha, ",
  "mn95:12.2": "“Clearly the student Kāpaṭika will talk about the scriptural heritage of the three Vedas. ",
  "mn95:12.3": "That’s why the brahmins put him at the front.” ",

  "mn95:12.5": "“When the ascetic Gotama looks at me, I’ll ask him a question.” ",
  "mn95:12.6": "Then the Buddha, knowing Kāpaṭika’s train of thought, looked at him. ",

  "mn95:12.13": "What do you say about this?” ",
  "mn95:13.1": "“Well, Bhāradvāja, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this: ",

They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught. ",

  "mn95:13.24": "In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be like a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. ",
  "mn95:13.25": "What do you think, Bhāradvāja? ",
  "mn95:13.26": "This being so, doesn’t the brahmins’ faith turn out to be baseless?” ",
