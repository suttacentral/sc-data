  "mn146:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn146:2.1": "Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī together with around five hundred nuns approached the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, ",

  "mn146:4.5": "“Yes, sir,” replied Nandaka. Then, in the morning, he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. ",
  "mn146:4.6": "He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Royal Monastery with a companion. ",
