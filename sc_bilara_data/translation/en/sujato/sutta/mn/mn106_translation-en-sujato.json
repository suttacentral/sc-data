  "mn106:3.7": "Why don’t I meditate with an abundant, expansive heart, having mastered the world and stabilized the mind? ",
  "mn106:3.8": "Then I will have no more bad, unskillful notions such as desire, ill will, and aggression. ",
  "mn106:3.9": "And by giving them up my mind, no longer limited, will become limitless and well developed.’ ",
  "mn106:3.10": "Practicing in this way and meditating on it often their mind becomes confident in this dimension. ",
  "mn106:3.11": "Being confident, they either attain the imperturbable now, or are freed by wisdom. ",

  "mn106:10.3": "‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine. I am giving up what exists, what has come to be.’ ",

  "mn106:10.10": "In this way they gain equanimity. ",
  "mn106:10.11": "They approve, welcome, and keep clinging to that equanimity. ",
  "mn106:10.12": "Their consciousness has that as support and fuel for grasping. ",
  "mn106:10.13": "A mendicant with fuel for grasping does not become extinguished.” ",

  "mn106:11.3": "“Sir, it seems that mendicant is grasping the best thing to grasp!” ",
  "mn106:11.4": "“Indeed, Ānanda. ",
  "mn106:11.5": "For the best thing to grasp is ",
  "mn106:11.6": "the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. ",
  "mn106:12.1": "Take a mendicant who practices like this: ",

  "mn106:12.4": "They don’t approve, welcome, or keep clinging to that equanimity. ",

  "mn106:13.1": "“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! ",
  "mn106:13.2": "It seems the Buddha has explained to us how to cross over the flood by relying on one support or another. ",
  "mn106:13.3": "But sir, what is noble liberation?” ",
  "mn106:13.4": "“Ānanda, it’s when a noble disciple reflects like this: ",

  "mn106:13.10": "that is substantial reality as far as substantial reality extends. ",
  "mn106:13.11": "But this is freedom from death, namely the liberation of the mind through not grasping. ",
  "mn106:14.1": "So, Ānanda, I have taught the ways of practice suitable for attaining the imperturbable, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. I have taught how to cross the flood by relying on one support or another, and I have taught noble liberation. ",
  "mn106:15.1": "Out of sympathy, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. ",
  "mn106:15.2": "Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” ",
  "mn106:15.3": "That is what the Buddha said. ",
  "mn106:15.4": "Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda approved what the Buddha said. "
