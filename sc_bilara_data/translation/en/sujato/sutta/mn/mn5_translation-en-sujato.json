  "mn5:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn5:1.3": "There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: ",
  "mn5:1.4": "“Reverends, mendicants!” ",
  "mn5:1.5": "“Reverend,” they replied. ",
  "mn5:1.6": "Sāriputta said this: ",
  "mn5:2.1": "“Reverends, these four individuals are found in the world. ",
  "mn5:2.2": "What four? ",
  "mn5:2.3": "One individual with a blemish doesn’t truly understand: ‘There is a blemish in me.’ ",

  "mn5:4.1": "“Reverends, take the case of the individual who has a blemish and does not understand it. You can expect that they won’t generate enthusiasm, make an effort, or rouse up energy to give up that blemish. ",

  "mn5:32.1": "In the same way, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and idiotic. Venerable Sāriputta planes their faults with this exposition of the teaching as if he knows my heart with his heart! ",

They’re not restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They guard their sense doors and eat in moderation, and they are dedicated to wakefulness. They care about the ascetic life, and keenly respect the training. They’re not indulgent or slack, nor are they leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion. They’re energetic and determined. They’re mindful, with situational awareness, immersion, and unified minds; wise and clever. Hearing this exposition of the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta, they drink it up and devour it, as it were. And in speech and thought they say: ",
  "mn5:32.3": "‘It’s good, sirs, that he draws his spiritual companions away from the unskillful and establishes them in the skillful.’ ",
  "mn5:33.1": "Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. Presented with a garland of lotuses, jasmine, or liana flowers, they would take them in both hands and place them on the crown of the head. ",
