  "an6.42:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "an6.42:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. ",
  "an6.42:1.3": "He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. ",
  "an6.42:1.4": "The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard: ",
  "an6.42:1.5": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. ",
  "an6.42:1.6": "He has this good reputation: ",
  "an6.42:1.7": "‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ ",
  "an6.42:1.8": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased; and he explains a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” ",
  "an6.42:1.9": "Then, when the night had passed, they took many fresh and cooked foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket. ",

  "an6.42:2.2": "Then the Buddha said to Nāgita, ",

  "an6.42:2.4": "“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many fresh and cooked foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.” ",
  "an6.42:2.5": "“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. ",
  "an6.42:2.6": "There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. ",
  "an6.42:2.7": "Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.” ",
  "an6.42:3.1": "“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent! ",
  "an6.42:3.2": "Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. ",
  "an6.42:3.3": "Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. ",
  "an6.42:3.4": "It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill. ",
  "an6.42:3.5": "In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. ",

  "an6.42:4.2": "There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. ",
  "an6.42:4.3": "Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity. ",
  "an6.42:5.1": "Take a mendicant living within a village who I see sitting immersed in samādhi. ",
  "an6.42:5.2": "I think to myself: ",
  "an6.42:5.3": "‘Now a monastery worker, a novice, or a fellow practitioner will make this venerable fall from immersion.’ ",
  "an6.42:5.4": "So I’m not pleased that that mendicant is living within a village. ",
  "an6.42:6.1": "Take a mendicant in the wilderness who I see sitting nodding in meditation. ",
  "an6.42:6.2": "I think to myself: ",

  "an6.42:10.1": "Take a mendicant who I see in the wilderness receiving robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. ",
  "an6.42:10.2": "Fending off possessions, honor, and popularity they don’t neglect retreat, and they don’t neglect remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. ",
  "an6.42:10.3": "So I’m pleased that that mendicant is living in the wilderness. ",
