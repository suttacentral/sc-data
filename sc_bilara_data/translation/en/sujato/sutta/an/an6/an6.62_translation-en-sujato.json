  "an6.62:1.4": "The mendicants entered Daṇḍakappaka to look for a guest house. ",
  "an6.62:2.1": "Then Venerable Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Aciravatī River to bathe. ",
  "an6.62:2.2": "When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying his limbs. ",
  "an6.62:2.3": "Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Ānanda, and said to him, ",
  "an6.62:2.4": "“Reverend Ānanda, when the Buddha declared that Devadatta was ",
  "an6.62:2.5": "going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable, did he do so after wholeheartedly deliberating, or was this just a way of speaking?” ",
  "an6.62:2.6": "“You’re right, reverend, that’s how the Buddha declared it.” ",

  "an6.62:5.4": "But circling all around the sewer they couldn’t see even a fraction of a hair’s tip of that person that was not smeared with feces. ",
  "an6.62:5.5": "In the same way, when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta ",
  "an6.62:5.6": "I declared that he was ",
