  "an8.43:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery. ",
  "an8.43:1.2": "Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her: ",
  "an8.43:1.3": "“Visākhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and dazzling and bountiful. ",

  "an8.43:3.2": "Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi, Kosala, Vajji, Malla, Cetī, Vaccha, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven kinds of precious things. ",
  "an8.43:3.3": "This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors. ",
