  "an8.45:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "an8.45:1.2": "Then the laywoman Bojjhā went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her: ",
  "an8.45:2.1": "“Bojjhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and dazzling and bountiful. ",
  "an8.45:2.2": "And how should it be observed? ",
  "an8.45:2.3": "It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ",
  "an8.45:2.4": "‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. ",
  "an8.45:2.5": "I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of sympathy for all living beings. ",

  "an8.45:3.4": "This is its eighth factor. ",
  "an8.45:3.5": "The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and dazzling and bountiful. ",
  "an8.45:4.1": "How much so? ",
  "an8.45:4.2": "Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi, Kosala, Vajji, Malla, Cetī, Vaccha, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven kinds of precious things. ",
  "an8.45:4.3": "This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors. ",

  "an8.45:6.7": "Twelve such months make up a year. ",
  "an8.45:6.8": "The life span of the gods who Control what is created by Others is sixteen thousand of these heavenly years. ",

  "an8.45:6.11": "‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’ ",
  "an8.45:7.1": "You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal, ",
