  "an8.45:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "an8.45:1.2": "Then the laywoman Bojjhā went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her: ",
  "an8.45:2.1": "“Bojjhā, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. ",
  "an8.45:2.2": "And how should it be observed? ",
  "an8.45:2.3": "It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ",
  "an8.45:2.4": "‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. ",
  "an8.45:2.5": "I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. ",

  "an8.45:3.4": "This is its eighth factor. ",
  "an8.45:3.5": "The observance of the sabbath with its eight factors in this way is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. ",
  "an8.45:4.1": "How much so? ",
  "an8.45:4.2": "Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsī, Kosala, Vajjī, Malla, Ceti, Vaṅga, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrusena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven kinds of precious things. ",
  "an8.45:4.3": "This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors. ",
  "an8.45:4.4": "Why is that? ",

  "an8.45:6.7": "Twelve such months make up a year. ",
  "an8.45:6.8": "The life span of the gods who control the creations of others is sixteen thousand of these divine years. ",

  "an8.45:6.11": "‘Human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods.’ ",
  "an8.45:7.1": "You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal, ",

  "an8.45:8.2": "you should sleep on a low bed, <j>or a mat on the ground. ",
  "an8.45:8.3": "This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say, ",
  "an8.45:8.4": "explained by the Buddha, <j>who has gone to suffering’s end. ",
  "an8.45:9.1": "The moon and sun are both fair to see, ",

  "an8.45:10.3": "rose-gold or pure gold, ",
  "an8.45:10.4": "or natural gold dug up by marmots—",
