  "an2.33:1.4": "You would not have done enough to repay your mother and father even if you were to carry your mother around on one shoulder and your father on the other, and if you lived like this for a hundred years, and if you were to anoint, massage, bathe, and rub them; ",
  "an2.33:1.5": "and even if they were to defecate and urinate right there. ",
  "an2.33:1.6": "Even if you were to establish your mother and father as supreme monarchs of this great earth, abounding in the seven treasures, you would still not have done enough to repay them. ",
  "an2.33:1.7": "Why is that? ",
  "an2.33:1.8": "Parents are very helpful to their children: they raise them, nurture them, and show them the world. ",
  "an2.33:1.9": "But you have done enough, more than enough, to repay them if you encourage, settle, and ground unfaithful parents in faith, unethical parents in ethical conduct, stingy parents in generosity, or ignorant parents in wisdom.” ",

  "an2.34:1.1": "Then a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, ",

  "an2.36:1.6": "“Reverend,” they replied. ",
  "an2.36:1.7": "Sāriputta said this: ",

  "an2.36:1.11": "Sāriputta said this: ",
  "an2.36:2.1": "“Who is an individual fettered internally? ",
  "an2.36:2.2": "It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. ",
  "an2.36:2.3": "When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods. ",
  "an2.36:2.4": "When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this place. ",

  "an2.36:3.2": "It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and resorting for alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. ",
  "an2.36:3.3": "They enter and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind. ",
  "an2.36:3.4": "When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods. ",
  "an2.36:3.5": "When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not coming back to this place. ",
  "an2.36:3.6": "This is called an individual who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this place. ",
  "an2.36:4.1": "Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical … they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. ",
  "an2.36:4.2": "They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures. ",
  "an2.36:4.3": "They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives. ",
  "an2.36:4.4": "They practice for the ending of craving. ",

  "an2.36:4.8": "This is called an individual who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this place.” ",
  "an2.36:5.1": "Then several peaceful-minded deities went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, ",
  "an2.36:5.2": "“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about an individual with internal fetters and one with external fetters. ",
  "an2.36:5.3": "The assembly is overjoyed! ",
  "an2.36:5.4": "Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of sympathy.” ",
  "an2.36:5.5": "The Buddha consented with silence. ",
  "an2.36:5.6": "Then the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, in front of Sāriputta. ",
  "an2.36:5.7": "He sat on the seat spread out. ",
  "an2.36:5.8": "Sāriputta bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. ",
  "an2.36:5.9": "The Buddha said to him: ",
  "an2.36:6.1": "“Just now, Sāriputta, several peaceful-minded deities came up to me, bowed, and stood to one side. Those deities said to me: ",
  "an2.36:6.2": "‘Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery, where he is teaching the mendicants about an individual with internal fetters and one with external fetters. ",

  "an2.36:6.5": "Those deities, though they number ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other. ",
  "an2.36:6.6": "Sāriputta, you might think: ",
  "an2.36:6.7": "‘Surely those deities, since so many of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other, must have developed their minds in that place.’ ",
  "an2.36:6.8": "But you should not see it like this. ",
  "an2.36:6.9": "It was right here that those deities developed their minds. ",
  "an2.36:6.10": "So you should train like this: ",
  "an2.36:6.11": "‘We shall have peaceful faculties and peaceful minds.’ ",
  "an2.36:6.12": "That’s how you should train. ",
  "an2.36:6.13": "When your faculties and mind are peaceful, your acts of body, speech, and mind will be peaceful, thinking: ",
  "an2.36:6.14": "‘We shall present the gift of peace to our spiritual companions.’ ",
  "an2.36:6.15": "That’s how you should train. ",
  "an2.36:6.16": "Those wanderers of other religions, Sāriputta, who have not heard this exposition of the teaching are lost.” ",

  "an2.37:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "an2.37:1.2": "At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying at Varaṇā, on the bank of the Kaddama Lake. ",
  "an2.37:1.3": "Then the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa went up to Mahākaccāna, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "an2.37:1.4": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākaccāna: ",
  "an2.37:1.5": "“What is the cause, worthy Kaccāna, what is the reason why aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders?” ",
  "an2.37:1.6": "“It is because of their insistence on sensual desire, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that aristocrats fight with aristocrats, brahmins fight with brahmins, and householders fight with householders.” ",
  "an2.37:2.1": "“What is the cause, worthy Kaccāna, what is the reason why ascetics fight with ascetics?” ",
  "an2.37:2.2": "“It is because of their insistence on views, their shackles, avarice, and attachment, that ascetics fight with ascetics.” ",
  "an2.37:3.1": "“Worthy Kaccāna, is there anyone in the world who has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?” ",
  "an2.37:3.2": "“There is, brahmin.” ",
  "an2.37:4.1": "“Who in the world has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views?” ",
  "an2.37:4.2": "“In the eastern lands there is a city named Sāvatthī. ",

  "an2.37:4.4": "He, brahmin, has gone beyond the insistence on sensual desire and the insistence on views.” ",
  "an2.37:5.1": "When this was said, the brahmin Ārāmadaṇḍa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: ",
  "an2.37:6.1": "“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! ",
  "an2.37:7.1": "Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! ",

  "an2.37:10.1": "Excellent, worthy Kaccāna! Excellent! ",
  "an2.37:10.2": "As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, the worthy Kaccāna has made the teaching clear in many ways. ",
  "an2.37:10.3": "I go for refuge to the worthy Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. ",

  "an2.38:1.4": "And this is indeed the case, ",
  "an2.38:1.5": "for the ascetic Kaccāna does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. ",
