  "an9.11:1.3": "“Sir, I have completed the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī. ",
  "an9.11:1.4": "I wish to depart to wander the countryside.” ",
  "an9.11:1.5": "“Please, Sāriputta, go at your convenience.” ",
  "an9.11:1.6": "Then Sāriputta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. ",

  "an9.11:1.8": "“Sir, Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.” ",

  "an9.11:3.1": "“Sir, someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. ",
  "an9.11:4.1": "Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this. ",

  "an9.11:9.3": "Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. ",
  "an9.11:10.1": "Suppose there was a bull with his horns cut, gentle, well tamed and well trained. He’d wander from street to street and square to square without hurting anyone with his feet or horns. ",

  "an9.11:11.1": "Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. If the corpse of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted. ",
  "an9.11:11.2": "In the same way, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by this rotten body. ",

  "an9.11:13.1": "Then that monk rose from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, ",
  "an9.11:13.2": "“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak ill of Venerable Sāriputta with a false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim. ",
  "an9.11:13.3": "Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” ",
  "an9.11:13.4": "“Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. ",
  "an9.11:13.5": "But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. ",
  "an9.11:13.6": "For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” ",
  "an9.11:14.1": "Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta, ",
  "an9.11:14.2": "“Sāriputta, forgive that silly man before his head explodes into seven pieces right here.” ",
  "an9.11:14.3": "“I will pardon that venerable if he asks me: ",
