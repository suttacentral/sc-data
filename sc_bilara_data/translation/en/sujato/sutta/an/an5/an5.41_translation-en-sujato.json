  "an5.41:1.3": "“Householder, there are these five reasons to get rich. ",
  "an5.41:1.4": "What five? ",
  "an5.41:1.5": "Firstly, with his legitimate wealth—earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow—a noble disciple makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself properly happy. ",
  "an5.41:1.6": "He makes his mother and father happy … ",

  "an5.41:4.3": "This is the fourth reason to get rich. ",
  "an5.41:5.1": "Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who refrain from intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. ",

  "an5.41:6.2": "‘So, the riches I have obtained for these reasons are running out.’ ",
  "an5.41:6.3": "And so he has no regrets. ",

  "an5.41:9.1": "A mortal man who recollects this ",
  "an5.41:9.2": "stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones. ",
