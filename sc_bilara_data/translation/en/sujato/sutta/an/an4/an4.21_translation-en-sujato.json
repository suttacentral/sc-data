  "an4.21:2.1": "“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. ",
  "an4.21:2.2": "As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ",
  "an4.21:2.3": "‘One without respect and reverence lives in suffering. ",
  "an4.21:2.4": "What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?’ ",

  "an4.21:7.1": "Then it occurred to me: ",
  "an4.21:7.2": "‘Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same teaching to which I was awakened?’ ",
  "an4.21:8.1": "And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, vanished from the Brahmā realm and appeared in front of me, as easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm. ",
  "an4.21:8.2": "He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said: ",

  "an4.21:10.2": "they did live, they do live, ",
  "an4.21:10.3": "and they also will live. ",
  "an4.21:10.4": "This is the nature of the Buddhas. ",
  "an4.21:11.1": "Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare, ",
  "an4.21:11.2": "and wants to become the very best they can be,",
  "an4.21:11.3": "should respect the true teaching, ",
  "an4.21:11.4": "remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.’ ",
