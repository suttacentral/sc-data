  "an4.36:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Ukkaṭṭhā and Setavyā, ",
  "an4.36:1.2": "as was the brahmin Doṇa. ",
  "an4.36:1.3": "Doṇa saw that the Buddha’s footprints had thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail. ",
  "an4.36:1.4": "It occurred to him, ",
  "an4.36:1.5": "“Oh lord, how incredible, how amazing! ",
  "an4.36:1.6": "Surely these couldn’t be the footprints of a human being?” ",
  "an4.36:1.7": "The Buddha had left the road and sat at the root of a tree cross-legged, setting his body straight, and establishing mindfulness in his presence. ",
  "an4.36:1.8": "Then Doṇa, following the Buddha’s footprints, saw him sitting at the tree root—impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and heart, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties. ",
  "an4.36:1.9": "He went up to the Buddha and said to him: ",
  "an4.36:2.1": "“Sir, might you be a god?” ",
  "an4.36:2.2": "“I will not be a god, brahmin.” ",
  "an4.36:2.3": "“Might you be a centaur?” ",

  "an4.36:2.5": "“Might you be a spirit?” ",
  "an4.36:2.6": "“I will not be a spirit.” ",
  "an4.36:2.7": "“Might you be a human?” ",
  "an4.36:2.8": "“I will not be a human.” ",
  "an4.36:3.1": "“When asked whether you might be a god, centaur, spirit, or human, ",
  "an4.36:3.2": "you answer that you will not be any of these. ",

  "an4.36:3.9": "So what then might you be?” ",
  "an4.36:4.1": "“Brahmin, if I had not given up defilements I might have become a god … a centaur … a spirit … or a human. But I have given up those defilements, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future. ",
  "an4.36:4.2": "",
  "an4.36:4.3": "Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to it. ",
  "an4.36:4.4": "In the same way, though I was born and grew up in the world, I live having mastered the world, unsullied by the world. ",
  "an4.36:4.5": "Remember me, brahmin, as a Buddha. ",
  "an4.36:5.1": "I could have been reborn as a god, ",
  "an4.36:5.2": "or as a centaur flying through the sky. ",
  "an4.36:5.3": "I could have become a spirit, ",
  "an4.36:5.4": "or returned as a human. ",
  "an4.36:5.5": "But I’ve ended those defilements, ",
  "an4.36:5.6": "they’re blown away and mown down. ",
  "an4.36:6.1": "Like a graceful lotus, ",
  "an4.36:6.2": "to which water does not cling, ",
  "an4.36:6.3": "the world doesn’t cling to me, ",
  "an4.36:6.4": "and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.” "
