  "an4.244:1.4": "‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. ",
  "an4.244:1.5": "May Your Majesty punish them!’ ",
  "an4.244:1.6": "The king would say: ",
  "an4.244:1.7": "‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ ",

  "an4.244:1.13": "In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding expulsion offenses. ",
  "an4.244:1.14": "It can be expected that if they haven’t committed an expulsion offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly. ",
  "an4.244:2.1": "Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a club on his shoulder. Then he approaches a large crowd and says: ",
