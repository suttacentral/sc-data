  "an3.16:1.2": "What three? ",
  "an3.16:1.3": "It’s when a mendicant guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness. ",
  "an3.16:2.1": "And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? ",
  "an3.16:2.2": "When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. ",
  "an3.16:2.3": "If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. ",

  "an3.16:3.3": "‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ ",

  "an3.16:4.2": "It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. ",
