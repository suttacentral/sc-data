  "an3.70:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "an3.70:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother in the Eastern Monastery. ",
  "an3.70:1.3": "Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her, ",
  "an3.70:1.4": "“So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” ",
  "an3.70:1.5": "“Today, sir, I’m observing the sabbath.” ",
  "an3.70:2.1": "“There are, Visākhā, these three sabbaths. ",
  "an3.70:2.2": "What three? ",
  "an3.70:2.3": "The sabbath of the cowherds, the sabbath of the Jains, and the sabbath of the noble ones. ",
  "an3.70:2.4": "And what is the sabbath of the cowherds? ",
  "an3.70:2.5": "It’s just like a cowherd who, in the late afternoon, takes the cows back to their owners. They reflect: ",
  "an3.70:2.6": "‘Today the cows grazed in this spot and that, and they drank in this spot and that. ",
  "an3.70:2.7": "Tomorrow the cows will graze in this spot and that, and drink in this spot and that.’ ",
  "an3.70:2.8": "In the same way, someone keeping the sabbath reflects: ",
  "an3.70:2.9": "‘Today I ate this and that, and had a meal of this and that. ",
  "an3.70:2.10": "Tomorrow I’ll eat this and that, and have a meal of this and that.’ ",
  "an3.70:2.11": "And so they spend their day with a mind full of covetousness. ",
  "an3.70:2.12": "That’s the sabbath of the cowherds. ",
  "an3.70:2.13": "When the cowherd’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or dazzling or bountiful. ",
  "an3.70:3.1": "And what is the sabbath of the Jains? ",
  "an3.70:3.2": "There’s a kind of ascetic belonging to a group called the Jains. ",
  "an3.70:3.3": "They encourage their disciples: ",
  "an3.70:3.4": "‘Please, good people, don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the east. ",

  "an3.70:3.7": "Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the south.’ ",
  "an3.70:3.8": "So they encourage kindness and sympathy for some creatures and not others. ",

  "an3.70:3.10": "‘Please, good people, take off all your clothes and say: ",
  "an3.70:3.11": "“I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me anywhere!”’ ",
  "an3.70:3.12": "But their mother and father still know, ",
  "an3.70:3.13": "‘This is our child.’ ",
  "an3.70:3.14": "And they know, ",
  "an3.70:3.15": "‘This is my mother and father.’ ",
  "an3.70:3.16": "Partner and child still know, ",
  "an3.70:3.17": "‘This is our supporter.’ ",

  "an3.70:3.22": "And they know, ",
  "an3.70:3.23": "‘These are my bondservants, workers, and staff.’ ",
  "an3.70:3.24": "So, at a time when they should be encouraged to speak the truth, the Jains encourage them to lie. ",
  "an3.70:3.25": "This, I say, is lying. ",
  "an3.70:3.26": "When the night has passed they use their possessions once more, though they’ve not been given back to them. ",
  "an3.70:3.27": "This, I say, is stealing. ",
