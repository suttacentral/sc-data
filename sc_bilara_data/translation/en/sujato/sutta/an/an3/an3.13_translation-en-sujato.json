  "an3.13:1.4": "And what, mendicants, is a hopeless individual? ",
  "an3.13:1.5": "It’s when an individual is reborn in a low family—a family of corpse-workers, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or scavengers—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. ",
  "an3.13:1.6": "And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrances, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. ",

  "an3.13:2.1": "And what, mendicants, is a hopeful individual? ",
  "an3.13:2.2": "It’s when someone is the eldest son of an anointed aristocratic king. He has not yet been anointed, but is eligible, and has been confirmed in the succession. ",
  "an3.13:2.3": "He hears this: ",

  "an3.13:4.5": "It’s when an individual is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, festering, and depraved. ",
  "an3.13:4.6": "They hear this: ",
  "an3.13:4.7": "‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ ",
  "an3.13:4.8": "It never occurs to them: ",
  "an3.13:4.9": "‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ ",
  "an3.13:4.10": "This is called a hopeless individual. ",
  "an3.13:5.1": "And what, mendicants, is a hopeful individual? ",
  "an3.13:5.2": "It’s when a mendicant is ethical, of good character. ",
  "an3.13:5.3": "They hear this: ",
  "an3.13:5.4": "‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ ",
