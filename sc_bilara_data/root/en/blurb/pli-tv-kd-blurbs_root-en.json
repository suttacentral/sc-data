  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd1": "The Mahākhandhaka, “the Great chapter”, begins by telling the story of the Buddha after his awakening. Three of the Buddha’s first and most well-known discourses—the Setting in motion of the wheel of the Teaching, the Characteristics of non-self, and the Discourse on fire—are given in full.

A large number of rules that concern ordination, especially about the eligibility of the candidate, are laid down, as are rules governing the relationship between teacher and student, including rules about novices.",

It is on these days that the main rules binding on all monastics, the Monastic Code or the Pātimokkha, is recited.

It also mentions a number of rules that are relaxed for lands outside of the middle Ganges plain.",
  "pli-tv-kd-blurbs:pli-tv-kd6": "The Bhesajjakkhandhaka, “the Chapter on medicines”, concerns allowable medicines and medical treatment.

It also features the stories of the courtesan Ambapālī offering her mango grove to the Sangha, the conversion of general Sīha, and the exceptional layman Meṇḍaka, after whom the Meṇḍaka allowance is named. This allowance enables lay supporters to deposit a fund with a steward, who is to be approached by a designated monastic in need of requisites. The chapter concludes with four general standards to help monastics decide what is and what is not allowable.",

The chapter begins with the story of “the Kosambī incident”, which led to a serious dispute and spilt in the Sangha. The Buddha tells the story of Dīghāvu, a longer version of the Kosambiya Jātaka of the Jātaka collection, in an attempt at getting the monks to come to their senses. Failing at this, he goes to visit the three friends Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila, who exemplify the art of living in harmony.",
