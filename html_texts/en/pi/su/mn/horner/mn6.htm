<h1>6. Discourse On What One May Wish</h1>
</div>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd1"></a><a class="wp" id="wp1"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.33"></a><span class="evam">Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered one,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd2"></a>“Fare along, monks, possessed of moral habit, possessed of the Obligations, fare along controlled by the control of the Obligations, possessed of right conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults; undertaking them rightly, train yourselves in the rules of training.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd3"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I be agreeable to my fellow Brahma-farers, liked by them, revered and respected,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd4"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I be one who receives the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd5"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May these services of those from whom I enjoy the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, requisites for the sick, be of great merit, of great advantage,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd6"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May this be a great fruit, a great<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en42"></a> advantage to those of my kith and kin who, their minds pleased, recollect the departed who have passed away,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd7"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I be one who overcomes aversion and liking, and may aversion not overcome me, may I fare along constantly conquering any aversion that has arisen,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd8"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I be one who overcomes fear and dread, and may fear and dread not overcome me, may I fare along constantly conquering any fear and dread that has arisen,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd9"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I be one who, at will, without trouble, without difficulty, acquires the four meditations which are of the purest mentality, abidings in ease here-now,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd10"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘Those incorporeal deliverances which are calmed, transcending forms, may I fare along having realised them while in the body,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd11"></a><a class="pts" id="pts1.34"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘By the total destruction of the three fetters may I be a stream-attainer, not liable to the Downfall, assured, bound for awakening,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd12"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘By the total destruction of the three fetters, by the reduction of attachment, aversion, confusion, may I be a once-returner; having come back once only to this<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en43"></a> world, may I make an end of anguish,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd13"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘By the total destruction of the five fetters that bind one to the lower world, may I be of spontaneous uprising, one who has utterly attained to Nibbāna there, not liable to return from that world,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd14"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I experience the various forms of psychic power: Having been one may I be manifold, having been manifold may I be one; manifest or invisible may I go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as if through air; may I plunge into the ground and shoot up again as if in water; may I walk upon the water without parting it as if on the ground; sitting cross-legged may I travel through the air like a bird on the wing; with my hand may I rub and stroke this moon and sun although they are of such mighty power and majesty; and even as far as the Brahma-world may I have power in respect of my body,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd15"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘By the purified deva-like hearing which surpasses that of men, may I hear both (kinds of) sounds: deva-like ones and human ones, whether they be far or near,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd16"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I know intuitively by mind the minds of other beings, of other individuals, so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is full of attachment that it is full of attachment; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is without attachment, that it is without attachment; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is full of aversion, that it is full of aversion; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is without aversion, that it is without<a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en44"></a> aversion; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is full of confusion, that it is full of confusion; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is without confusion, that it is without confusion; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is contracted that it is contracted; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is distracted that it is distracted; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that has become great that it has become great; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that has not become great that it has not become great; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind with (some other mental state) superior to it that it has (some other mental state) superior to it; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that has no (other mental state) superior to it that it has no (other mental state) superior to it; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is composed that it is composed; or so that I may know intuitively <a class="pts" id="pts1.35"></a>of a mind that is not composed that it is not composed; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is freed that it is freed; or so that I may know intuitively of a mind that is not freed that it is not freed,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd17"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I recollect (my) manifold former habitations, that is to say, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many an eon of integration, many an eon of disintegration, many an eon of integration-disintegration; such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this I arose here. Thus may I remember (my) divers former habitations in all their modes and detail,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd18"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘With the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, may I behold beings as they pass hence or come to be, mean, excellent, fair, foul, in a good bourn, in a bad bourn, according to the consequences of their deeds; may I comprehend: Indeed these worthy beings were possessed of wrong conduct in body, speech and thought, they were scoffers at the ariyans, holding a wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body, speech and thought, who were not scoffers at the ariyans, holding a right view, incurring deeds consequent on a right view, <a class="pts-vp-en" id="pts-vp-en45"></a>these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world. Thus, with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men may I behold beings as they pass hence, as they arise, mean, excellent, fair, foul, in a good bourn, in a bad bourn, according to the consequences of their deeds,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd19"></a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘By the destruction of the cankers, having realised by my own super-knowledge here and now the freedom of mind, and freedom through wisdom that are cankerless, entering thereon, may I abide therein,’ <a class="pts" id="pts1.36"></a>he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd20"></a>That of which I have spoken thus was spoken in relation to this: Fare along, monks, possessed of moral habit, possessed of the Obligations, fare along controlled by the control of the Obligations, possessed of right conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults; undertaking them rightly, train yourselves in the rules of training.”</p>
<p><a class="bd" id="bd21"></a>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
