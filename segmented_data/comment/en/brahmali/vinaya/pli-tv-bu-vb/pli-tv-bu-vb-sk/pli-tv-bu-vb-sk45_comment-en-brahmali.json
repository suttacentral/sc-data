  "pli-tv-bu-vb-sk45:1.3": "According to [Sp.2.621]() this means repeatedly breaking pieces off a ball of food. The word _avacchedaka_, is further explained at [Vin-vn-ṭ.1920]() as _chinditvā_, “having broken off”. This, it seems, can only refer to breaking off pieces, not to biting.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-sk45:1.11": "_Khajjaka_. According to [Sp.2.615]() this refers to all non-staple foods: _Ettha mūlakhādanīyādi sabbaṃ gahetabbaṃ_, “Here the non-staple foods which are roots, etc. may all be taken.” | _Phalāphale_. See the PTS’ Pali English Dictionary, s.v. _ā_<sup>4</sup>. | _Uttaribhaṅga_. According to [Vin-vn-ṭ.1907]() this is just another word for _byañjana_: _uttaribhaṅgaṃ nāma byañjanaṃ_. _Byañjana_ seems to refer to curries apart from the standard bean-curries, which are called _sūpa_."
