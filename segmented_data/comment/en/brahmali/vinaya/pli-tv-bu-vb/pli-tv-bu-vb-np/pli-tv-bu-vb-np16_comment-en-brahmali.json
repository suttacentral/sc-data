  "pli-tv-bu-vb-np16:1.24": "Three _yojanas_. The length of a _yojana_ is uncertain, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. But a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or approximately 13 kilometers (see “On the Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon”, by Thomas Rhys Davids, p.16). Thus 3 _yojanas_ is close to 40 km, which seems like a suitably round number given the uncertainty in the estimate."
