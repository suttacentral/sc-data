  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21:3.1.38": "This seems to say that if the nuns are all present then the monk must always give an _ovāda_ that consists in teaching the eight _garudhammas_.This, however, needs to be seen in light of the further subdivision given in the text above, where the instruction in the _garudhammas_ is to be given only when the nuns say they are not practicing them.If the nuns are practicing the _garudhammas_, there seems to be no restriction on the nature of the _ovāda_.",

A more natural meaning might be to see this statement in conjunction with the previous one, and the two together might then be paraphrased as follows: If the nuns say they are not all present, then one should not instruct in the eight rules to be respected, nor in any other teaching. In any case, once “Sisters, this is the instruction” has been said, it seems any teaching can be given; see [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc22:1.9)."
