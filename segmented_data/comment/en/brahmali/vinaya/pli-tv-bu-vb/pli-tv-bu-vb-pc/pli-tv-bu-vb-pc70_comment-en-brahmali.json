  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:2.1.21": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, _so vā āroceti_, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “_sa (sā) āroceti_ (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. [Sanskrit] _ārocayate_ med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 29 [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:3.1.6) where the text says that she tells (_sā vā āroceti_) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case _āroceti_ cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straight-forward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it simply refers to the donor telling the monk directly.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc70:2.1.29": "I render both _cuṇṇa_ and _mattika_ according to function rather than substance. _Cuṇṇa_ is powder used for a number of purposes, including medical ones, and _mattika_ is clay, but in this context both are used as cleaning agents. There are a number of Canonical passages that show them as the two principal agents for cleaning the body. At [](pli-tv-kd1:25.12.4) and a number of similar passages, we find that the two would always be made ready before entering the _jantāghara_, the sauna/bathroom. At _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 57 bathing is defined as bathing with powder and/or clay. At [](pli-tv-kd20:27.4.5) and [](pli-tv-kd20:27.4.12 the nuns are prohibited from bathing with powder or scented clay, but should use ordinary clay instead. In the commentaries, at [Sp.3.33](), we find that clay is used for washing one’s hair: _Kesā panassa sayameva mattikaṃ gahetvā dhovitabbā_."
