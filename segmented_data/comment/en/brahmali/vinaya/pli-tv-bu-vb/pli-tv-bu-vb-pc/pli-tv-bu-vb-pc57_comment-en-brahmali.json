  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:1.6": "_Asambhinnena vilepanena_, an unusual expression. According to [Sp-ṭ.3.1.357](), _asambhinnena_ means “with [make-up] not smeared, not lost”, _amakkhitena, anaṭṭhena_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:7.1.8": "_Mattika_. I translate both _cuṇṇa_ and _mattika_ according to function rather than substance. _Cuṇṇa_ is powder used for a number of purposes, including medical ones, and _mattika_ is clay, but in this context both are used as cleaning agents. There are a number of Canonical passages that show them as the two principal agents for cleaning the body. At [](pli-tv-kd1:25.12.4) and a number of similar passages, we find that the two would always be made ready before entering the _jantāghara_, the sauna/bathroom. In the present rule, this very definition states that bathing includes the use of powder and/or clay. At [](pli-tv-kd20:27.4.5) and [](pli-tv-kd20:27.4.12) the nuns are prohibited from bathing with powder or scented clay, but should use ordinary clay instead. In the commentaries, at [Sp.3.33](), we find that clay is used for washing one’s hair: _Kesā panassa sayameva mattikaṃ gahetvā dhovitabbā_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc57:7.1.21": ". Half a _yojana_. The length of a _yojana_ is uncertain, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. But a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or just under 13 kilometers (see “On the Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon”, by Thomas Rhys Davids, p.16). Thus half a _yojana_ is just over 6 km."
