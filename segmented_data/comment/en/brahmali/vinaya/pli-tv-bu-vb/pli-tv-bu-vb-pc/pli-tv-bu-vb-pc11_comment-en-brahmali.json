Liyanaratne, p.75, as the _Acorus calamus_ | _Vacatta_. [Sp.3.263](): _Vacattanti setavacaṃ_, “_Vacatta_ is the ‘white sweet flagʼ.” Monier-Williams’ Sanskrit English Dictionary (SED): “Ṣvetavacā [= setavaca], f. N. of two kinds of plant (= ativisha or = Ṣuklavacā), L.” Yet the _ativisha_/_ativisā_ is identified as a separate plant in the Pali text. Moreover, SED identifies the _Ṣuklavacā_ as _Terminalia Chebula_, which is called _harītaka_ in the Pali texts. The identity of the _vacatta_ consequently remains uncertain, but it seems possible that it is a sub-species of the _vacā_. | _Ativisā_.
