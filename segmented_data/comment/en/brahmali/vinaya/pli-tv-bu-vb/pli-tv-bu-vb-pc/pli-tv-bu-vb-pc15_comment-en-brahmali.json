  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15:1.5": "“Furniture” renders _senāsana_. _Senāsana_, lit. “bed and seat”, refers broadly to any kind of “resting place”, ranging from huts ([](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.2)) to furniture ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc14:1.1.5)) and bedding ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15:1.5)), including even resting places at the foot of a tree ([](pli-tv-kd1:77.1.10)). It can also mean an individual resting place within a single dwelling ([](pli-tv-kd5:13.8.5)). This broad range of meaning is confirmed by the sub-commentary at [Sp-ṭ.3.2.294](): _Catubbidhañhi senāsanaṃ vihārasenāsanaṃ mañcapīṭhasenāsanaṃ santhatasenāsanaṃ okāsasenāsananti. … Yattha vā pana bhikkhū paṭikkamanti, sabbametaṃ senāsananti_, “There are four kinds of _senāsana_: the dwelling _senāsana_, the bed-or-bench _senāsana_, the bedding (or “mat”) _senāsana_, the place _senāsana_. … Wherever monks retire to, all that is called _senāsana_.” It is almost impossible to capture this range of meaning in a single English word, with the possible exception of “resting place”. In practice, however, “resting place” is too vague to be properly meaningful. For this reason I vary my translation according to context, using “dwelling”, “furniture”, and “resting place” as appropriate.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc15:2.1.8": "[Sp-yoj.1.112](): _Cammakhaṇḍoti ettha cammaṃyeva ante khaṇḍattā chinnattā cammakhaṇḍoti vuccati_, “Here _cammakhaṇḍa_ is just a hide. Because it is cut up within and made of pieces, it called a _cammakhaṇḍa_.”"
