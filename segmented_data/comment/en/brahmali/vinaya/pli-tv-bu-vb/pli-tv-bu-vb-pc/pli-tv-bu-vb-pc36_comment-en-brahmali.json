  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:1.17": "That is, why did he not say that the food was not leftover.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:2.1.12": "_Akappiyakataṃ hoti_, lit. “It is done with what is not allowable.” The “it”, both here and below, refers to the ceremony of making it allowable, and the “what” refers to the food.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36:2.1.28": "The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, _so vā āroceti_, is not clear. The Critical Pali Dictionary suggests: “_sa (sā) āroceti_ (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. [Sanskrit] _ārocayate_ med. caus. [middle voice causative] in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 29 [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29:3.1.6) where the text says that she tells (_sā vā āroceti_) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case _āroceti_ cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straight-forward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it simply refers to the donor telling the monk directly."
