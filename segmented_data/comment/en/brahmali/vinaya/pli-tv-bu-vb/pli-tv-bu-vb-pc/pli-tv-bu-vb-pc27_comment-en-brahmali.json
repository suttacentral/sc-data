  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc27:2.16": "_Sattho_, often translated as caravan. According to [Sp-ṭ.2.1.489]() this refers either to a caravan of travelers walking on foot or to a caravan of carts: _satthoti jaṅghasattho sakaṭasattho vā_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc27:3.1.13": "Half a _yojana_. The length of a _yojana_ is uncertain, and perhaps it never was a precise distance. But a reasonable estimate is 8 miles or just under 13 kilometers (see “On the Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon”, by Thomas Rhys Davids, p.16). Thus half a _yojana_ is just over 6 km."
