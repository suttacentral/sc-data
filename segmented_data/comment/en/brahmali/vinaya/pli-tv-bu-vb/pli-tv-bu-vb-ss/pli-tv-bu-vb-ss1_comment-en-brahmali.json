For the meaning of _mānatta_ see “A Translation and Analysis of the Pātimokkha”, by Bhikkhu Ñāṇatusita, p.123. | The point here, which can only be understood from the Pali, is that the word _saṅghādisesa_ (_saṅgha_ + _ādisesa_) is derived from the fact that only the _sangha_ can do the legal procedures required when a monastic commits this offense.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:4.27": "_Usseko_, which I take to be related to _seka_, perhaps via the prefix _ud_.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1:5.9.7": "Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues in Buddhist Monastic Code I, page 105, that it was the novice monk who emitted semen. But these rules concern monks, not novices. In the present case the Buddha specifically says that there is no offense of _saṅghādisea_, which would make no sense if it referred to the novice monk. Bhikkhu Ṭhānissaro argues that his reading is required, otherwise we are forced to conclude that _saṅghādisea_ offenses can be occurred by indirect stimulation. I disagree. These cases are limited in scope and do not always include all the factors required for the committing of an offense."
