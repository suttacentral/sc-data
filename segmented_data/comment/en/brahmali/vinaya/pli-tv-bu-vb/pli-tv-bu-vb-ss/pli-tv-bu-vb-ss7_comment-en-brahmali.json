  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:1.19": "I have rendered _sassāmikaṃ_ as “with a sponsoring owner”. The word _sāmika_ generally means “owner”, and there seems to be no reason why that should not also be the meaning here. However, although the monk does not own the dwelling, he is still the builder and the intended user once the building is finished. To indicate this, I have added the word “sponsoring”.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:3.4.22": "These ellipses points, and those in the next segment, are not found in the Pali. I have added them for clarity.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7:3.7.6": "The term _guhā_ does not have a precise equivalent in English. The general meaning seems to be “enclosed place” or “hiding place”, derived from the root _guh_, meaning “to cover” or “to hide”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka such places are either naturally occurring, as in _giriguhā_ [](pli-tv-kd16:1.1.4), or man-made [](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.8). But in most cases, probably all cases, a _guhā_ was used to shelter or cover something. It was used, for instance, to shelter food from the rain [](pli-tv-kd6:33.2.1), to store robes from destruction by insects [](pli-tv-kd8:7.1.3), and to shelter monks while doing the _uposatha_ ceremony [](pli-tv-kd2:8.1.7). Further details are found in the commentaries, e.g. at [Sp.4.294](): _Guhāti iṭṭhakāguhā silāguhā dāruguhā paṃsuguhā_, “_Guhā_: a _guhā_ made of bricks, a _guhā_ made of rocks, a _guhā_ made of wood, a _guhā_ made of dirt.” And [Sp.ṭ.3.294](): _Giriguhā nāma dvinnaṃ pabbatānaṃ antarā, ekasmiṃyeva vā umaṅgasadisaṃ mahāvivaraṃ_, “_Giriguha_: in the middle of two hills or a great opening like a tunnel in just one (of them).” In sum, it is likely that “cave” does not properly capture all nuances of _guhā_, but in the absence of a more fitting term, it is perhaps satisfactory."
