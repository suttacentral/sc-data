  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.12": "“Taking up” here renders both _samādāya_ and _paggayha_, and as a consequence it appears as if one of the definitions found in the Pali is missing in the translation. In the Pali _samādāya_ is defined as _ādāya_, “having adopted”, and _paggayha_ as _dīpeyya_, “he proclaims”.",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.62": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṃ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, an offense. Yet just below the text says that the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
