  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc36:1.12": "The Pali has the singular _bhaginiyā_, “for a sister”, but I render it in the plural to fit better with English idiom.",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc36:2.1.10": "“Sibling” renders _bhātaro_, literally “brothers”. In the Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both genders. For instance, the plural of _putta_, literally “sons”, often means “children”. In the same way, the plural of _bhātā_ can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding nouns that normally refers to males is confirmed by the Pali lexical work the Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā: _Ettha hi mātā ca pitā ca pitaro, putto ca dhītā ca puttā, sassu ca sasuro ca sasurā, bhātā ca bhaginī ca bhātaroti bhinnaliṅgānampi ekaseso dassitoti_, “‘Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.” ",  
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pc36:2.1.49": "_Ñattiyā dukkaṭaṃ_. The Pali text just says _dukkaṭa_, without specifying that it is an _āpatti_, “an offense”. Yet elsewhere, such a _bhikkhu-saṅghādisesa_ 10, [](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10:2.65), the _dukkaṭa_ is annulled if you commit the full offense of _saṅghādisesa_. The implication is that in these contexts _dukkaṭa_ should be read as _āpatti dukkaṭassa_, “an offense of wrong conduct”."
