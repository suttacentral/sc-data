The commentary explains that the penalty is imposed by assembling at the nuns’ dwelling place, _bhikkhunupassaye_, and those assembled then use the term _ayya_ when referring to the monk who acted inappropriately. Only nuns use this term when referring to monks.",
  "pli-tv-kd20:9.3.19": "“Did not deliberate” renders _vinicchayaṃ na denti_. The commentaries are silent. I take it to mean that the monks did not deliberate on whether the nuns had changed their behavior.",

Although I have rendered _paṇḍaka_ as “eunuch”, it does not seem right to translate _itthipaṇḍaka_ as “female eunuch”, which is largely meaningless, especially so in an ancient Indian context. It seems the idea of a _paṇḍaka_ expanded over time and that the _itthipaṇḍaka_ may refer to this expanded category, see [this article](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/the-meaning-of-pa-aka-in-light-of-the-vedic-and-jain-scriptures/12894). According to [Sp.1.285](): _Itthipaṇḍakāti animittāva vuccati_, “It is just a woman without genitals who is called an _itthipaṇḍakā_.” This seems strange since in the ordination procedure a woman is asked both whether she is an _itthipaṇḍaka_ and whether she is _animitta_. If they mean the same thing, then we have a redundancy. Perhaps the two words are close in meaning, but not identical, and thus the apparent redundancy. Given the commentarial explanation, I have opted to translate _itthipaṇḍaka_ as “a woman without sexual characteristics”. | _Vepurisikā_. [Sp.1.285](): _Vepurisikāti samassudāṭhikā purisarūpā itthī_, “_Vepurisikā_ means a woman who has a beard and a mustache like a man.” | _Sambhinnā_. [Sp.1.285](): _Sambhinnāti sambhinnavaccamaggapassāvamaggā_, “_Sambhinnā_ means the anus and the vagina are joined.” That _passāvamagga_, “the path of urine”, can refer to the vagina is clear from _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 1 at [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1:9.1.10) where it refers to an orifice for sexual intercourse. Also, it is anatomically more likely that the anus and vagina would be conjoined, rather than the anus and the urethra.",

It seems plausible to identify _kilāsa_ with the former and _kuṭṭha_ with the latter. But to avoid the technical Latinate medical vocabulary, I render them respectively as “mild leprosy” and “leprosy”.",
  "pli-tv-kd20:17.2.4": "“Who is free from the obstructions” renders _visuddhā_, often translated as “pure”. In the present case, however, the contextual meaning is that she is pure of or free from the obstructions to ordination.",

Taking the genitive case here to be the agent genitive, which seems to be the most obvious reading, this would mean, “So-and-so who is seeking to be fully ordained *by* Venerable so-and-so.” But it is the Sangha that ordains, not individuals, and so this translation does not seem quite right. According to [Vmv.3.126]() this phrase should be understood by means of this example: _Ayaṃ buddharakkhito āyasmato dhammarakkhitassa saddhivihārikabhūto upasampadāpekkho_, “This Buddharakkhita, who is seeking the full ordination, is the student of Venerable Dhammarakkhita.” I have followed this interpretation, and thus my translation “with Venerable so-and-so”.",

What time did you have?

  "pli-tv-kd20:19.1.4": "_Yā na pavāreyya, yathādhammo kāretabbo_. Curiously the _yā_ does not agree with _kāretabbo_. This could indicate that the statement should be understood as impersonal: “If she doesn’t, it [the transgression] should be dealt with according to the rule.” However, elsewhere where the same sentence recurs, the pronoun always seems to agree with participle, and thus I conclude that the present case is an aberration, possibly a fault in the text.",
