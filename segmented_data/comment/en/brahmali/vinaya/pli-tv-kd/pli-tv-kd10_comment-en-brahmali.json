  "pli-tv-kd10:2.6.7": "_Viññutaṃ pāpuṇi_, lit. “reached discernment”. Commenting on a similar context in the _Bhikkhunī-kkhandhaka_, [Sp.4.432]() explains: _Yāva so dārako viññutaṃ pāpuṇātīti yāva khādituṃ bhuñjituṃ nahāyituñca maṇḍituñca attano dhammatāya sakkotīti attho_, “_Yāva so dārako viññutaṃ pāpuṇāti_ means until he is able to eat, bathe, and groom himself.”",
  "pli-tv-kd10:4.5.5": "_Harita_ could in principle refer to all plants, but it is elsewhere defined as what is cultivated, see [](pli-tv-bu-vb-pc19:2.1.14) and [](pli-tv-bi-vb-pc9:2.1.14).",
  "pli-tv-kd10:4.5.7": "“Dining hall” renders _bhattagga_, lit. “eating house”. The name suggests that the _bhattagga_ was a separate building for eating. They were found both in private houses and in monasteries, as can be seen from the present passage. Since they were part of houses, “refectory” is not a satisfactory rendering. The fact that kitchens are not mentioned separately may mean that they were part of the _bhattagga_, except in monasteries. This is supported by a passage in _bhikkhu-pārājika_ 3 ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3:5.3.1)) that mentions a cooking implement, a pestel, being stored in a _bhattagga_.",
  "pli-tv-kd10:5.13.2": "_Yasmiṃ, āvuso, vatthusmiṃ ahosi saṃghassa bhaṇḍanaṃ kalaho viggaho vivādo saṃghabhedo saṃgharāji saṃghavavatthānaṃ saṃghanānākaraṇaṃ, so eso bhikkhu āpanno ca ukkhitto ca passi ca osārito ca_. A literal translation of this might read, “In regard to which reason there was quarrel, argument, conflict, dispute, schism, fracture, division, and separation in the Sangha, this monk has committed, and has been ejected, and he has seen, and he has been reinstated.” I understand this to mean that the basis for the conflict has been dealt with."
