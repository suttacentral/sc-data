We may perhaps assume that the average height of an Indian man at the time of the Buddha was roughly the same, say 160 centimeters. If we assume, following The Buddhist Monastic Code I (p.465), that the forearm (_hattha_) is one quarter the length of a person’s height, we then have a forearm measure of 40 cm.

  "pli-tv-kd15:14.5.1": "“Precincts” renders _pariveṇa_, sometimes rendered as “cell”, for which there is no proper basis. The _pariveṇa_ is the area surrounding a building. That it is not an indoor area can be seen from the present context where a _pariveṇa_ is said to get muddy, upon which the Buddha allows gravel, paving stones, and drains. The _pariveṇa_ is often mentioned in connection with keeping a building tidy, specifically as an area that is to be swept ([](pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2:1.1.6)). It seems natural to conclude that this must refer to the area, or part of it, that surrounds a building. This is confirmed by the commentaries. [Sp.ṭ.3.117](): _Pariveṇanti ekekassa vihārassa parikkhepabbhantaraṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: 11 meters surrounding each individual dwelling.” Sometimes, but not always it seems, this area would be walled in. [Sp.ṭ.2.103}: _Pariveṇanti mahāvihārassa abbhantare visuṃ visuṃ pākāraparicchinnaṭṭhānaṃ_, “_Pariveṇa_: a separate place delimited by a wall within a large monastery.” This fits with the fact that _pariveṇas_ are said to be constructed ([](pli-tv-kd3:5.5.9]()), as well as the frequent mention in the Vinaya Piṭaka of _koṭṭhakas_, “gateways”. Gateways would make no sense without a surrounding wall. On a more general note, the term _pariveṇa_ is not found in the four main Nikāyas, and in the Vinaya Piṭaka it is found only in narratives, minor rules on conduct, and explanatory material. This suggests it may not have existed in the earliest period of Buddhist monasticism. The earliest buildings and monasteries would have been simple, without much embellishment, especially the surrounding walls.",

A _jantāgharasālā_ is then presumably another building (from the description below it seems to a separate building from the sauna) where you get undressed and hang up your robes, etc. “Water-boiling shed” renders _aggisālā_. _Sālā_ is etymologically related to the English word “hall” and is often translated as such. In some contexts this may be roughly appropriate, but _sālā_ is in fact used much more broadly than “hall”. At the lower end of the spectrum it refers to small buildings, probably no more than sheds, for instance the _aggisālā_ (“a water-boiling shed”), the _udapānasāla_ (“a well-house”), and the _pānīyasālā_ (“a drinking-water shed”). Buildings that were presumably intermediate in size, were also called _sālā_, such as the _kathinasālā_ (“a sewing shed”), the _jantāgharasālā_ (“a sauna shed”), and the _āpaṇasālā_ (“a shop”). _Sālā_ includes buildings that would have been quite substantial, including the _upaṭṭhānasālā_ (“an assembly hall”). The Canon also mentions the _kūṭāgārasālā_ (“the peaked house _sālā_”) and the fact that wealthy people had _mahāsālās_ (“large _sālās_”). In addition to this, _sālā_ covers large but simple buildings, such as _caṅkamasālā_ (“an indoor walking path”), _gosālā_ (“a cow shed”), _assasālā_ (“a horse stables”), and _hatthisālā_ (“an elephant stables”). Apart from the issue of size, there is no indication that a _sālā_ had to consist of a single room, as implied by the rendering “hall”. Another piece of evidence is found at _bhikkhu-pācittiya_ 31, where the _sālā_ as a venue for eating is contrasted with the _maṇḍapa_ (“a roof-cover”) and open air venues (_rukkhamūla_ and _ajjhokāsa_). In this last instance _sālā_ seems to be a generic reference to an indoor venue, perhaps best rendered as “building”.
