  "dn29:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "dn29:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans in a stilt longhouse in a mango grove belonging to the Sakyan family named Vedhañña. ",
  "dn29:2.1": "Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at Pāvā. ",
  "dn29:2.2": "With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding each other with barbed words: ",
  "dn29:2.3": "“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!” ",
  "dn29:2.4": "You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics. ",
  "dn29:2.5": "And the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge. ",
  "dn29:3.1": "And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",
  "dn29:3.2": " ",
  "dn29:3.3": " ",
  "dn29:4.1": "Ānanda said to him, ",
  "dn29:4.2": "“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. ",
  "dn29:4.3": "Come, let’s go to the Buddha and tell him about this.” ",
  "dn29:4.4": "“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. ",
  "dn29:5.1": "Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",

  "dn29:6.0": "1. The Teaching of the Unawakened ",
  "dn29:6.1": "“That’s what happens, Cunda, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. ",

  "dn29:6.3": "A disciple in that teaching does not practice in line with the teachings, does not practice following that procedure, does not live in line with the teaching. They proceed having turned away from that teaching. ",
  "dn29:6.4": "You should say this to them, ",
  "dn29:6.5": "‘You’re fortunate, reverend, you’re so very fortunate! ",
  "dn29:6.6": "For your teacher is not awakened, and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. ",
  "dn29:6.7": "But you don’t practice in line with that teaching, you don’t practice following that procedure, you don’t live in line with the teaching. You proceed having turned away from that teaching.’ ",
  "dn29:6.8": "In such a case the teacher and the teaching are to blame, but the disciple deserves praise. ",
  "dn29:6.9": "Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple, ",
  "dn29:6.10": "‘Come on, venerable, practice as taught and pointed out by your teacher.’ ",
  "dn29:6.11": "The one who encourages, the one who they encourage, and the one who practices accordingly all make much bad karma. ",

  "dn29:27.7": "I have allowed alms-food for you that suffices ",
  "dn29:27.8": "only to continue and sustain this body, avoid harm, and support spiritual practice; so that you will put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and will keep on living blamelessly and at ease. ",
  "dn29:27.9": "I have allowed lodgings for you that suffice ",
  "dn29:27.10": "only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat. ",

  "dn29:28.5": "For there are many different kinds of indulgence in pleasure.’ ",
  "dn29:29.1": "These four kinds of indulgence in pleasure, Cunda, are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. ",
  "dn29:29.2": "What four? ",
  "dn29:30.1": "It’s when some fool makes themselves happy and pleased by killing living creatures. ",

  "dn29:36.2": "What four? ",
  "dn29:37.1": "It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "dn29:37.2": "This is the first kind of indulgence in pleasure. ",
  "dn29:38.1": "Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption.

  "dn29:38.2": "This is the second kind of indulgence in pleasure. ",
  "dn29:39.1": "Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",

  "dn29:43.9": "This is the second fruit and benefit. ",
  "dn29:43.10": "Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. ",
  "dn29:43.11": "This is the third fruit and benefit. ",
  "dn29:43.12": "Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. ",

  "dn29:46.4": "From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the natural principle of extinguishment, without anything left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise. ",
  "dn29:46.5": "That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. ",
  "dn29:46.6": "The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does. ",
