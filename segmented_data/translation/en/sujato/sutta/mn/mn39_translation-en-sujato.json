  "mn39:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Aṅgas, near the Aṅgan town named Assapura. ",
  "mn39:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn39:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn39:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn39:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn39:2.1": "“Mendicants, people label you as ascetics. ",
  "mn39:2.2": "And when they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics. ",
  "mn39:2.3": "Given this label and this claim, you should train like this: ‘We will undertake and follow the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin. That way our label will be accurate and our claim correct. ",
  "mn39:2.4": "Any robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick that we use will be very fruitful and beneficial for the donor. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’ ",
  "mn39:2.5": " ",
  "mn39:3.1": "And what are the things that make one an ascetic and a brahmin? ",
  "mn39:3.2": "You should train like this: ‘We will have conscience and prudence.’ ",
  "mn39:3.3": "Now, mendicants, you might think, ",
  "mn39:3.4": "‘We have conscience and prudence. Just this much is enough. We have achieved the goal of life as an ascetic. There is nothing more to do.’ And you might rest content with just that much. ",
  "mn39:3.5": "I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you: ",
  "mn39:3.6": "‘You who seek to be true ascetics, do not lose sight of the goal of the ascetic life while there is still more to do.’ ",
  "mn39:4.1": "What more is there to do? ",
  "mn39:4.2": "You should train like this: ‘Our bodily behavior will be pure, clear, open, neither inconsistent nor secretive. ",

  "mn39:8.4": "If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, we will practice restraint, we will protect the faculty of sight, and we will achieve its restraint. ",

  "mn39:13.1": "After the meal, they return from alms-round, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. ",
  "mn39:13.2": "Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. ",
  "mn39:13.3": "Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. ",
  "mn39:13.4": "Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. ",
  "mn39:13.5": "Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. ",
  "mn39:13.6": "Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. ",
  "mn39:14.1": "Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work, ",
  "mn39:14.2": "and his efforts proved successful. ",

  "mn39:14.6": " ",
  "mn39:14.7": "he’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",

  "mn39:14.16": " ",
  "mn39:14.17": "they’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",

  "mn39:14.27": " ",
  "mn39:14.28": "they’d be filled with joy and happiness. ",
  "mn39:14.29": "In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards them as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing. ",
  "mn39:14.30": "But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and sanctuary. ",
  "mn39:15.1": "They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. ",
  "mn39:15.2": "Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn39:15.3": "They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. ",
  "mn39:15.4": "It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. ",
  "mn39:15.5": "In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. ",
  "mn39:16.1": "Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. ",
  "mn39:16.2": "They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. ",
  "mn39:16.3": "It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. ",
  "mn39:16.4": "In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. ",
  "mn39:17.1": "Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ ",
  "mn39:17.2": "They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. ",
  "mn39:17.3": "It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water. ",
  "mn39:17.4": "In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. ",
  "mn39:18.1": "Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. ",
  "mn39:18.2": "They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. ",
  "mn39:18.3": "It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth. ",
  "mn39:18.4": "In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. ",
  "mn39:19.1": "When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives. ",
  "mn39:19.2": "They recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details. ",
  "mn39:19.3": "Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’ ",
  "mn39:19.4": "In the same way, a mendicant recollects their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. ",
  "mn39:20.1": "When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. ",
  "mn39:20.2": "With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ",
  "mn39:20.3": "Suppose there were two houses with doors. A person with good eyesight standing in between them would see people entering and leaving a house and wandering to and fro. ",
  "mn39:20.4": "In the same way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ",
  "mn39:21.1": "When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. ",
  "mn39:21.2": "They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ ",
  "mn39:21.3": "They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements.’ ",
  "mn39:21.4": "Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. ",
  "mn39:21.5": "When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "mn39:21.6": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ ",
  "mn39:21.7": "Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. ",
  "mn39:21.8": " ",
  "mn39:21.9": "They’d think: ",
  "mn39:21.10": "‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the mussel shells, gravel and pebbles, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’ ",
  "mn39:21.11": "In the same way, a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ ",
  "mn39:21.12": "They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ ",
  "mn39:22.1": "This mendicant is called an ‘ascetic’, a ‘brahmin’, a ‘bathed initiate’, a ‘knowledge master’, a ‘scholar’, a ‘noble one’, and a ‘perfected one’. ",
  "mn39:23.1": "And how is a mendicant an ascetic? ",
  "mn39:23.2": "They have quelled the bad, unskillful qualities that are corrupted, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. ",
