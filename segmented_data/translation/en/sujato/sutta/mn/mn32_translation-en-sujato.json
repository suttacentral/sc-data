  "mn32:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying in the sal forest park at Gosiṅga, together with several well-known senior disciples, such as ",
  "mn32:1.3": "the venerables Sāriputta, Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Anuruddha, Revata, Ānanda, and others. ",
  "mn32:2.1": "Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and said, ",
  "mn32:2.2": "“Come, Reverend Kassapa, let’s go to Venerable Sāriputta to hear the teaching.” ",
  "mn32:2.3": "“Yes, reverend,” Mahākassapa replied. ",
  "mn32:2.4": "Then, together with Venerable Anuruddha, they went to Sāriputta to hear the teaching. ",
  "mn32:3.1": "Seeing them, Venerable Ānanda ",
  "mn32:3.2": "went to Venerable Revata, told him what was happening, ",

  "mn32:4.4": "Welcome to Ānanda, the Buddha’s attendant, who is so close to the Buddha. ",
  "mn32:4.5": "Ānanda, the sal forest park at Gosiṅga is lovely, the night is bright, the sal trees are in full blossom, and divine scents seem to float on the air. ",
  "mn32:4.6": "What kind of mendicant would beautify this park?” ",
  "mn32:4.7": "“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. ",
  "mn32:4.8": "And they teach the four assemblies in order to uproot the underlying tendencies with well-rounded and systematic words and phrases. ",

  "mn32:5.4": " ",
  "mn32:5.5": " ",
  "mn32:5.6": "“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who enjoys retreat and loves retreat. They’re committed to inner serenity of the heart, they don’t neglect absorption, they’re endowed with discernment, and they frequent empty huts. ",

  "mn32:7.6": "“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s a mendicant who lives in the wilderness, eats only alms-food, wears rag robes, and owns just three robes; and they praise these things. They are of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praise these things. They are accomplished in ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom; and they praise these things. ",

  "mn32:8.4": " ",
  "mn32:8.5": " ",
  "mn32:8.6": "“Reverend Sāriputta, it’s when two mendicants engage in discussion about the teaching. They question each other and answer each other’s questions without faltering, and their discussion on the teaching flows on. ",
  "mn32:8.7": "That’s the kind of mendicant who would beautify this park.” ",
  "mn32:9.1": "Then Mahāmoggallāna said to Sāriputta, ",

  "mn32:9.5": "What kind of mendicant would beautify this park?” ",
  "mn32:9.6": "“Reverend Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant masters their mind and is not mastered by it. ",
  "mn32:9.7": "In the morning, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want. ",
  "mn32:9.8": "At midday, ",
  "mn32:9.9": "and in the evening, they abide in whatever meditation or attainment they want. ",
