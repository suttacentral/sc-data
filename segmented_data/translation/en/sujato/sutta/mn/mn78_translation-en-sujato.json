  "mn78:0.2": "With Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍika ",
  "mn78:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn78:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. ",
  "mn78:1.3": "Now at that time the wanderer Uggāhamāna Samaṇamuṇḍikāputta was residing together with around three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for group debates, set among the flaking pale-moon ebony trees. ",
  "mn78:2.1": "Then the master builder Pañcakaṅga left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. ",
  "mn78:2.2": "It occurred to him, ",
  "mn78:2.3": "“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, ",
  "mn78:2.4": "as he’s in retreat. ",
  "mn78:2.5": "And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, ",
  "mn78:2.6": "as they’re in retreat. ",
  "mn78:2.7": "Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Uggāhamāna?” ",
  "mn78:2.8": "So that’s what he did. ",
  "mn78:3.1": "Now at that time, Uggāhamāna was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as ",
  "mn78:3.2": "talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. ",
  "mn78:3.3": "Uggāhamāna saw Pañcakaṅga coming off in the distance, ",
  "mn78:3.4": "and hushed his own assembly, ",
  "mn78:3.5": "“Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. ",
  "mn78:3.6": "Here comes Pañcakaṅga, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama. ",
  "mn78:3.7": "He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī. ",
  "mn78:3.8": "Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. ",
  "mn78:3.9": "Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” ",
  "mn78:3.10": "Then those wanderers fell silent. ",
  "mn78:4.1": "Then Pañcakaṅga approached Uggāhamāna, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "mn78:4.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Uggāhamāna said to him: ",
  "mn78:5.1": "“Householder, when an individual has four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. ",
  "mn78:5.2": "What four? ",
  "mn78:5.3": "It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood. ",
  "mn78:5.4": "When an individual has these four qualities I describe them as an invincible ascetic.” ",
  "mn78:6.1": "Then Pañcakaṅga neither approved nor dismissed that mendicant’s statement. ",
  "mn78:6.2": "He got up from his seat, thinking, ",
  "mn78:6.3": "“I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” ",
  "mn78:7.1": "Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, ",
  "mn78:7.2": "and informed the Buddha of all that had been discussed. ",
  "mn78:8.1": "When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, ",
  "mn78:8.2": "“Master builder, if what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. ",
  "mn78:8.3": "For a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘a body’, so how could they possibly do a bad deed with their body, apart from just wriggling? ",
  "mn78:8.4": "And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘speech’, so how could they possibly speak bad words, apart from just crying? ",
  "mn78:8.5": "And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘thought’, so how could they possibly think bad thoughts, apart from just whimpering? ",
  "mn78:8.6": "And a little baby doesn’t even have a concept of ‘livelihood’, so how could they possibly earn a living by bad livelihood, apart from their mother’s breast? ",
  "mn78:8.7": "If what Uggāhamāna says is true, a little baby boy is an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. ",
  "mn78:8.8": "When an individual has four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment—but as having achieved the same level as a little baby. ",
  "mn78:8.9": "What four? ",
  "mn78:8.10": "It’s when they do no bad deeds with their body; speak no bad words; think no bad thoughts; and don’t earn a living by bad livelihood. ",
  "mn78:8.11": "When an individual has these four qualities I describe them, not as an invincible ascetic, but as having achieved the same level as a little baby. ",
  "mn78:9.1": "When an individual has ten qualities, master builder, I describe them as an invincible ascetic—accomplished in the skillful, excelling in the skillful, attained to the highest attainment. ",
  "mn78:9.2": "But certain things must first be understood, I say. ‘These are unskillful behaviors.’ ",
  "mn78:9.3": " ",
  "mn78:9.4": "‘Unskillful behaviors stem from this.’ ",
  "mn78:9.5": " ",
