  "mn103:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Kusināra, in the Forest of Offerings. ",
  "mn103:1.3": "There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, ",
  "mn103:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn103:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn103:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn103:2.1": "“Mendicants, is this what you think of me? ",
  "mn103:2.2": "‘The ascetic Gotama teaches the Dhamma for the sake of robes, alms-food, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.’” ",
  "mn103:2.3": "“No sir, we don’t think of you that way.” ",

  "mn103:2.14": "that I teach out of compassion. ",
  "mn103:3.1": "In that case, each and every one of you should train in the things I have taught from my direct knowledge, that is: ",
  "mn103:3.2": "the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.

  "mn103:4.1": "As you do so, it may happen that two mendicants disagree about the teaching. ",
