  "mn33:1.4": "“Mendicants!” ",
  "mn33:1.5": "“Venerable sir,” they replied. ",
  "mn33:1.6": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "mn33:2.1": "“Mendicants, a cowherd with eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle. ",
  "mn33:2.2": "What eleven? ",
  "mn33:2.3": "It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. ",
  "mn33:2.4": "A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle. ",

  "mn33:6.2": "It’s when a mendicant tolerates a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen. They don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. ",

  "mn33:7.1": "And how does a mendicant not dress wounds? ",
  "mn33:7.2": "When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they get caught up in the features and details. ",
  "mn33:7.3": "Since the faculty of sight is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of sight, and they don’t achieve its restraint. ",

  "mn33:9.1": "And how does a mendicant not know the ford? ",
  "mn33:9.2": "It’s when a mendicant doesn’t from time to time go up to those mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the texts on monastic training, and the outlines—and ask them questions: ",
  "mn33:9.3": "‘Why, sir, does it say this? ",

  "mn33:10.1": "And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction? ",
  "mn33:10.2": "It’s when a mendicant, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, finds no joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds no joy connected with the teaching. ",

  "mn33:13.2": "It’s when a mendicant is invited by a householder to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, and that mendicant doesn’t know moderation in accepting. ",
  "mn33:13.3": "That’s how a mendicant milks dry. ",
