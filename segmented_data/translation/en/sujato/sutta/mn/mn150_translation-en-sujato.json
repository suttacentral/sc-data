  "mn150:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "mn150:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Nagaravinda. ",
  "mn150:2.1": "The brahmins and householders of Nagaravinda heard, ",
  "mn150:2.2": "“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—while wandering in the land of the Kosalans has arrived at Nagaravinda, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. ",

  "mn150:2.5": "He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. ",
  "mn150:2.6": "He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. ",

  "mn150:4.5": "Why is that? ",
  "mn150:4.6": "Because we ourselves are not free of these things, so we do not see that they have any higher good conduct than us. ",
  "mn150:4.7": "That’s why they don’t deserve honor, respect, reverence, and veneration. ",
  "mn150:4.8": "There are ascetics and brahmins who are not free of greed, hate, and delusion for sounds known by the ear … ",
