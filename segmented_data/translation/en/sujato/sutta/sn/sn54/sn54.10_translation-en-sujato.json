  "sn54.10:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "sn54.10:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. ",
  "sn54.10:1.3": "Then the Buddha said to Venerable Kimbila, ",
  "sn54.10:1.4": "“Kimbila, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” ",
  "sn54.10:2.1": "When he said this, Kimbila kept silent. ",
  "sn54.10:2.2": "For a second time … ",
  "sn54.10:2.3": "And for a third time, the Buddha said to him, ",
  "sn54.10:2.4": "“How is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” ",
  "sn54.10:2.5": "And a second time and a third time Kimbila kept silent. ",
  "sn54.10:3.1": "When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, ",
  "sn54.10:3.2": "“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! ",
  "sn54.10:3.3": "Let the Buddha speak on immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” ",
  "sn54.10:4.1": "“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” ",
  "sn54.10:4.2": "“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. ",
  "sn54.10:4.3": "The Buddha said this: ",
  "sn54.10:4.4": "“Ānanda, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial? ",
  "sn54.10:4.5": "It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. ",
  "sn54.10:4.6": "Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … ",
  "sn54.10:4.7": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ ",
  "sn54.10:4.8": "That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. ",
  "sn54.10:5.1": "When a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ ",
  "sn54.10:5.2": "When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ ",
  "sn54.10:5.3": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ ",
  "sn54.10:5.4": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’ ",
  "sn54.10:5.5": "At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:5.6": "Why is that? ",
  "sn54.10:5.7": "Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. ",
  "sn54.10:5.8": "Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:6.1": "There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’ ",
  "sn54.10:6.2": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’ ",
  "sn54.10:6.3": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mental processes.’ ",
  "sn54.10:6.4": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’ ",
  "sn54.10:6.5": "At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:6.6": "Why is that? ",
  "sn54.10:6.7": "Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. ",
  "sn54.10:6.8": "Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:7.1": "There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ ",

  "sn54.10:7.3": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’ ",
  "sn54.10:7.4": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ ",
  "sn54.10:7.5": "At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:7.6": "Why is that? ",
  "sn54.10:7.7": "Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. ",
  "sn54.10:7.8": "Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:8.1": "There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ ",
  "sn54.10:8.2": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’ ",
  "sn54.10:8.3": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’ ",
  "sn54.10:8.4": "They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ ",
  "sn54.10:8.5": "At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:8.6": "Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity. ",
  "sn54.10:8.7": "Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. ",
  "sn54.10:9.1": "Suppose there was a large heap of sand at the crossroads. ",
  "sn54.10:9.2": "And a cart or chariot were to come by from the east, ",
  "sn54.10:9.3": "west, ",
  "sn54.10:9.4": "north, ",
  "sn54.10:9.5": "or south and destroy that heap of sand. ",
  "sn54.10:9.6": "In the same way, when a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body, ",
  "sn54.10:9.7": "feelings, ",
  "sn54.10:9.8": "mind, ",
  "sn54.10:9.9": "or principles, they destroy bad, unskillful qualities.” ",
