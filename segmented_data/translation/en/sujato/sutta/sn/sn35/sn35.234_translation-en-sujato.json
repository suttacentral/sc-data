  "sn35.234:1.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda: ",
  "sn35.234:2.1": "“Reverend Ānanda, the Buddha has explained, opened, and illuminated in many ways how this body is not-self. ",
  "sn35.234:2.2": "Is it possible to explain consciousness in the same way? To teach, assert, establish, open, analyze, and make it clear how consciousness is not-self?” ",

  "sn35.234:7.1": "Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the root, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. ",
