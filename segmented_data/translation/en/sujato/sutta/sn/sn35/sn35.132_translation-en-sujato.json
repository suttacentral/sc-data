  "sn35.132:1.3": "“These shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, the Lord! They’re honored, respected, esteemed, revered, and venerated by those who pretend to inherit Vedic culture.” ",
  "sn35.132:1.4": "And then Mahākaccāna left his dwelling and said to those brahmin students, ",

  "sn35.132:8.3": "When they said this, Lohicca was offended and upset. ",
  "sn35.132:8.4": "Then he thought, ",
  "sn35.132:8.5": "“But it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to abuse or insult the ascetic Mahākaccāna solely because of what I’ve heard from these students. ",
  "sn35.132:8.6": "Why don’t I go and ask him about it?” ",
