  "sn35.74:1.2": "Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, and said to him, ",
  "sn35.74:1.3": "“Sir, in such and such a monastery there’s a mendicant who is junior and not well-known. He’s sick, suffering, gravely ill. ",
  "sn35.74:1.4": "Please go to him out of compassion.” ",
  "sn35.74:2.1": "When the Buddha heard that the mendicant was junior and ill, understanding that he was not well-known, he went to him. ",

  "sn35.74:7.1": "“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” ",
  "sn35.74:8.1": "“In that case, mendicant, why do you have remorse and regret?” ",
  "sn35.74:9.1": "“Because I understand that the Buddha has not taught the Dhamma merely for the sake of ethical purity.” ",

  "sn35.74:11.1": "“I understand that the Buddha has taught the Dhamma for the purpose of the fading away of greed.” ",

  "sn35.74:15.1": "“Impermanent, sir.” ",
  "sn35.74:16.1": "“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” ",
  "sn35.74:17.1": "“Suffering, sir.” ",
  "sn35.74:18.1": "“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and liable to fall apart, is it fit to be regarded thus: ",

  "sn35.74:20.1": "“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. ",
  "sn35.74:20.2": "Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "sn35.74:20.3": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended … there is no return to any state of existence.’” ",
