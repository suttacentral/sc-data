  "sn22.54:1.2": "“Mendicants, there are five kinds of plants propagated from seeds. ",
  "sn22.54:1.3": "What five? ",
  "sn22.54:1.4": "Plants propagated from roots, stems, cuttings, or joints; and those from regular seeds are the fifth. ",
  "sn22.54:1.5": "Suppose these five kinds of plants propagated from seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. But there’s no soil or water. ",
  "sn22.54:1.6": "Then would these five kinds of plants propagated from seeds reach growth, increase, and maturity?” ",
  "sn22.54:1.7": "“No, sir.” ",
  "sn22.54:1.8": "“Suppose these five kinds of plants propagated from seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. And there is soil and water. ",

  "sn22.54:1.13": "Consciousness with its fuel should be seen as like the five kinds of plants propagated from seeds. ",
  "sn22.54:2.1": "As long as consciousness remains, it would remain involved with form, supported by form, grounded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature. ",
  "sn22.54:2.2": "Or consciousness would remain involved with feeling … ",
  "sn22.54:2.3": "Or consciousness would remain involved with perception … ",
  "sn22.54:2.4": "Or as long as consciousness remains, it would remain involved with choices, supported by choices, grounded on choices. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature. ",
  "sn22.54:3.1": "Mendicants, suppose you say: ",
  "sn22.54:3.2": "‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’ That is not possible. ",
  "sn22.54:4.1": "If a mendicant has given up greed for the form element, ",
  "sn22.54:4.2": "the support is cut off, and there is no foundation for consciousness. ",

  "sn22.54:4.7": "the support is cut off, and there is no foundation for consciousness. ",
  "sn22.54:4.8": "Since that consciousness does not become established and does not grow, with no power to regenerate, it is freed. ",
  "sn22.54:4.9": "Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. ",
  "sn22.54:4.10": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended … there is no return to any state of existence.’” "
