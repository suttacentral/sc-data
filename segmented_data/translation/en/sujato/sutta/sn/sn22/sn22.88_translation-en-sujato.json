  "sn22.88:4.4": "“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” … ",
  "sn22.88:4.5": "“So you should truly see … ",

  "sn22.88:4.7": "They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ ",
  "sn22.88:4.8": "If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. ",
