  "sn22.81:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. ",
  "sn22.81:1.2": "Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms. ",
  "sn22.81:1.3": "After the meal, on his return from alms-round, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion. ",
  "sn22.81:2.1": "Then, not long after the Buddha had left, one of the mendicants went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what had happened. ",
  "sn22.81:2.2": " ",
  "sn22.81:2.3": "Ānanda said, “Reverend, when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone. ",
  "sn22.81:2.4": "At this time no-one should follow him.” ",
  "sn22.81:3.1": "Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage, arrived at Pārileyya, ",
  "sn22.81:3.2": "where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree. ",
  "sn22.81:3.3": "Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "sn22.81:3.4": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, ",
  "sn22.81:3.5": "“Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. ",
  "sn22.81:3.6": "We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” ",
  "sn22.81:4.1": "Then Venerable Ānanda together with those mendicants went to Pārileyya to see the Buddha. They bowed and sat down to one side, ",
  "sn22.81:4.2": "and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. ",
  "sn22.81:4.3": "Now at that time one of the monks had the thought, ",
  "sn22.81:4.4": "“How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?” ",
  "sn22.81:4.5": "Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: ",
  "sn22.81:4.6": "“Mendicants, I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. ",
  "sn22.81:4.7": "I’ve analytically taught the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, ",

  "sn22.81:4.14": "That’s how I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. ",
  "sn22.81:4.15": "Though I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically, still a certain mendicant present here has this thought: ",
  "sn22.81:4.16": "‘How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?’ ",
  "sn22.81:5.1": "And how, mendicants, do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life? ",
  "sn22.81:5.2": "Take an uneducated ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. ",
  "sn22.81:5.3": "They regard form as self. ",
  "sn22.81:5.4": "But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. ",
  "sn22.81:5.5": "And what’s the source, origin, birthplace, and root of that conditioned phenomenon? ",
  "sn22.81:5.6": "When an uneducated ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. ",
  "sn22.81:5.7": "That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. ",
  "sn22.81:5.8": "So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. ",
