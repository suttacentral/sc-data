  "sn22.89:11.7": "Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ ",
  "sn22.89:11.8": "As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated. ",
  "sn22.89:12.1": "Suppose there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled, so the owners give it to a launderer. ",
  "sn22.89:12.2": "The launderer kneads it thoroughly with salt, lye, and cow dung, and rinses it in clear water. ",
  "sn22.89:12.3": "Although that cloth is clean and bright, it still has a lingering scent of salt, lye, or cow dung that had not been eradicated. ",
  "sn22.89:12.4": "The launderer returns it to its owners, who store it in a chest permeated with scent. ",
  "sn22.89:12.5": "And that lingering scent would be eradicated. ",
  "sn22.89:12.6": "In the same way, although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated. ",

  "sn22.89:12.12": "Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ ",
  "sn22.89:12.13": "As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated.” ",
  "sn22.89:13.1": "When he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Khemaka, ",
  "sn22.89:13.2": "“We didn’t want to trouble Venerable Khemaka with our questions. But you’re capable of explaining, teaching, advocating, establishing, disclosing, analyzing, and clarifying the Buddha’s instructions in detail. ",
  "sn22.89:13.3": "And that’s just what you’ve done.” ",
  "sn22.89:14.1": "That’s what Venerable Khemaka said. ",
  "sn22.89:14.2": "Satisfied, the senior mendicants were happy with what Venerable Khemaka said. ",
  "sn22.89:14.3": "And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty senior mendicants and of Venerable Khemaka were freed from defilements by not grasping. "
