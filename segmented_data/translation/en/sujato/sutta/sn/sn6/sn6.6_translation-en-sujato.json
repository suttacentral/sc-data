  "sn6.6:1.3": "Then the independent brahmās Subrahmā and Suddhāvāsa went to the Buddha and stationed themselves one by each door-post. But Subrahmā said to Suddhāvāsa, ",
  "sn6.6:1.4": "“Good sir, it’s the wrong time to pay homage to the Buddha. ",
  "sn6.6:1.5": "He has gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. ",
  "sn6.6:1.6": "But such and such Brahmā realm is successful and prosperous, while the Brahmā living there is negligent. ",

  "sn6.6:1.8": "“Yes, good sir,” replied Suddhāvāsa. ",

  "sn6.6:3.1": "When they had spoken, that Brahmā refused to accept their advice. He multiplied himself a thousand times and said to Subrahmā, ",

  "sn6.6:3.3": "“I see that, good sir.” ",
  "sn6.6:3.4": "“Since I have such psychic power and might, what other ascetic or brahmin should I go to and attend upon?” ",
