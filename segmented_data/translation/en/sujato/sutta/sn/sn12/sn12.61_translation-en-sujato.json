  "sn12.61:1.1": "So I have heard. ",
  "sn12.61:1.2": "At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. … ",
  "sn12.61:1.3": "“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. ",
  "sn12.61:1.4": "Why is that? ",
  "sn12.61:1.5": "This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest. ",
  "sn12.61:1.6": "That’s why, when it comes to this body, an uneducated ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. ",
  "sn12.61:2.1": "But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed. ",
  "sn12.61:2.2": "Why is that? ",
  "sn12.61:2.3": "Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it: ",
  "sn12.61:2.4": "‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ ",
  "sn12.61:2.5": "That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an uneducated ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. ",
  "sn12.61:3.1": "But an uneducated ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind. ",
  "sn12.61:3.2": "Why is that? ",
  "sn12.61:3.3": "This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer. ",
  "sn12.61:4.1": "But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. ",
  "sn12.61:4.2": "It’s like a monkey moving through the forest. It grabs hold of one branch, lets it go, and grabs another; then it lets that go and grabs yet another. ",
  "sn12.61:4.3": "In the same way, that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. ",
  "sn12.61:5.1": "In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ",
  "sn12.61:5.2": "‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. ",
  "sn12.61:5.3": "When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: ",
  "sn12.61:5.4": "Ignorance is a condition for choices. ",
  "sn12.61:5.5": "Choices are a condition for consciousness. … ",
  "sn12.61:5.6": "That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. ",
  "sn12.61:5.7": "When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. ",
  "sn12.61:5.8": "When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … ",
  "sn12.61:5.9": "That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ ",
  "sn12.61:6.1": "Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. ",
  "sn12.61:6.2": "Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. ",
  "sn12.61:6.3": "They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” "
