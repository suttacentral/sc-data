  "sn48.42:1.2": "Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. ",
  "sn48.42:1.3": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: ",
  "sn48.42:2.1": "“Master Gotama, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. ",
  "sn48.42:2.2": "What five? ",
  "sn48.42:2.3": "The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. ",
  "sn48.42:2.4": "What do these five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to? What experiences their scopes and ranges?” ",

  "sn48.42:6.2": "“Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window, where would it land?” ",

  "sn48.42:6.4": "“In the same way, the brahmin Uṇṇābha’s faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep. It’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. ",
  "sn48.42:6.5": "If he were to pass away at this time, he would be bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.” "
