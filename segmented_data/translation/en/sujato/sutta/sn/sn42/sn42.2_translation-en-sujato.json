  "sn42.2:1.3": "“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said: ",
  "sn42.2:1.4": "‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ ",

  "sn42.2:2.13": "‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ This is your wrong view. ",
