  "sn42.9:2.4": "“Come, chief, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. ",
  "sn42.9:2.5": "Then you will get a good reputation: ",
  "sn42.9:2.6": "‘Asibandhaka’s son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’” ",

  "sn42.9:4.12": "Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.” ",
  "sn42.9:5.1": "When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha, ",
  "sn42.9:5.2": "“Excellent, sir! Excellent! … ",
