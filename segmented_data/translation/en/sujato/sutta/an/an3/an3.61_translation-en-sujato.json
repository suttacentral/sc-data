  "an3.61:1.1": "“Mendicants, these three sectarian tenets—as pursued, pressed, and grilled by the astute—when taken to their conclusion, end with inaction. ",
  "an3.61:1.2": "What three? ",
  "an3.61:1.3": "There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ",

  "an3.61:3.1": "Those who believe that past deeds are the most important thing have no enthusiasm or effort, no idea that there are things that should and should not be done. ",
  "an3.61:3.2": "Since they don’t acknowledge as a genuine fact that there are things that should and should not be done, they’re unmindful and careless, and can’t rightly be called ascetics. ",

  "an3.61:10.2": "That’s what I said, ",
  "an3.61:10.3": "but why did I say it? ",
  "an3.61:10.4": "There are these six elements: ",

  "an3.61:17.1": "And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering? ",
  "an3.61:17.2": "It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: ",
  "an3.61:17.3": "right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. ",
  "an3.61:17.4": "This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. ",
  "an3.61:17.5": "‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.’ ",
