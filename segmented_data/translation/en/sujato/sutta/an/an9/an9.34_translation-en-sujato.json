  "an9.34:1.1": "At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. ",
  "an9.34:1.2": "There he addressed the mendicants: ",
  "an9.34:1.3": "“Reverends, extinguishment is bliss! ",
  "an9.34:1.4": "Extinguishment is bliss!” ",
  "an9.34:1.5": "When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him, ",
  "an9.34:1.6": "“But Reverend Sāriputta, what’s blissful about it, since nothing is felt?” ",
  "an9.34:1.7": "“The fact that nothing is felt is precisely what’s blissful about it. ",
  "an9.34:1.8": "Reverend, there are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. ",
  "an9.34:1.9": "What five? ",
  "an9.34:1.10": "Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. ",

  "an9.34:1.15": "These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation. ",
  "an9.34:1.16": "The pleasure and happiness that arise from these five kinds of sensual stimulation is called sensual pleasure. ",
  "an9.34:2.1": "First, take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures … enters and remains in the first absorption. ",
  "an9.34:2.2": "While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset them, that’s an affliction for them. ",
  "an9.34:2.3": "Suppose a happy person were to experience pain; that would be an affliction for them. ",
  "an9.34:2.4": "In the same way, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset them, that’s an affliction for them. ",
  "an9.34:2.5": "And affliction has been called suffering by the Buddha. ",
  "an9.34:2.6": "That’s the way to understand how extinguishment is bliss. ",
  "an9.34:3.1": "Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption. ",
  "an9.34:3.2": "While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing of the mind and keeping it connected beset them, that’s an affliction for them. ",

  "an9.34:5.1": "Furthermore, take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption. ",
  "an9.34:5.2": "While a mendicant is in such a meditation, should perceptions and attentions accompanied by equanimous bliss beset them, that’s an affliction for them. ",
