  "an4.244:1.1": "“Mendicants, there are these four perils of offenses. ",
  "an4.244:1.2": "What four? ",
  "an4.244:1.3": "Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: ",
  "an4.244:1.4": "‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. ",
  "an4.244:1.5": "May Your Majesty punish them!’ ",
  "an4.244:1.6": "The king would say: ",
  "an4.244:1.7": "‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ ",
  "an4.244:1.8": "The king’s men would do as they were told. ",
  "an4.244:1.9": "Then a bystander might think: ",
  "an4.244:1.10": "‘This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense. ",
  "an4.244:1.11": " ",
  "an4.244:1.12": "There’s no way I’d ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense.’ ",
  "an4.244:1.13": "In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding expulsion offenses. ",
  "an4.244:1.14": "It can be expected that if they haven’t committed an expulsion offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly. ",
  "an4.244:2.1": "Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a club on his shoulder. Then he approaches a large crowd and says: ",
  "an4.244:2.2": "‘Sirs, I’ve done a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of clubbing. I submit to your pleasure.’ ",
  "an4.244:2.3": "Then a bystander might think: ",

  "an4.244:2.7": "There’s no way I’d ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of clubbing.’ ",
  "an4.244:2.8": "In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding suspension offenses. It can be expected that if they haven’t committed a suspension offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly. ",
  "an4.244:3.1": "Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a sack of ashes on his shoulder. Then he approaches a large crowd and says: ",

  "an4.244:3.9": "There’s no way I’d ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of a sack of ashes.’ ",
  "an4.244:3.10": "In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding confessable offenses. It can be expected that if they haven’t committed a confessable offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly. ",
  "an4.244:4.1": "Suppose a man was to put on a black cloth and mess up his hair. Then he approaches a large crowd and says: ",

  "an4.244:4.11": "These are the four perils of offenses.” "
