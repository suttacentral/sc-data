  "an4.171:7.7": "“Sāriputta, it refers to the gods reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.” ",
  "an4.171:8.1": "“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some sentient beings pass away from that realm as returners who come back to this state of existence, ",

  "an4.171:8.3": "“Sāriputta, take a person who hasn’t given up the lower fetters. In the present life they enter and abide in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. ",
  "an4.171:8.4": "They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. ",
  "an4.171:8.5": "If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. ",
