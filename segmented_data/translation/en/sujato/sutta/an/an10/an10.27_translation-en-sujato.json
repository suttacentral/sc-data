  "an10.27:2.2": "When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: ",
  "an10.27:3.1": "“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ",
  "an10.27:3.2": "‘Please, mendicants, directly know all things. Meditate having directly known all things.’ ",

  "an10.27:4.3": "“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” ",
  "an10.27:5.1": "Then, after the meal, when they returned from alms-round, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. ",
