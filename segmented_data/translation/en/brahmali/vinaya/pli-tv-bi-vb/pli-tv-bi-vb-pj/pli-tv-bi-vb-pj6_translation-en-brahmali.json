  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.1^a": "Origin story ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.2": "At that time the nun Sundarīnandā was pregnant by Migāra’s grandson Sāḷha. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.3": "When the fetus got large, she concealed her condition. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.4": "When the fetus was fully grown, she disrobed and gave birth. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.5": "The nuns said to the nun Thullanandā, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.6": "“Venerable, Sundarīnandā gave birth shortly after disrobing.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.7": "“Could it be that she was pregnant while she was a nun?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.8": "“Yes, Venerables.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.9": "“But, Venerable, when you knew that that nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, why didn’t you either confront her yourself or tell others?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.10": "“Her blameworthiness is my blameworthiness, her bad reputation is my bad reputation, her notoriety is my notoriety, her loss is my loss. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.11": "Why would I tell others of my own blameworthiness, of my own bad reputation and notoriety, of my own loss?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.12": "The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.13": "“How could Venerable Thullanandā, knowing that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell others?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.14": "Then those nuns told the monks what had happened, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.15": "and the monks in turn told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.16": "Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha assembled and questioned the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.17": "“Is it true, monks, that the nun Thullanandā acted like this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.18": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.19": "The Buddha rebuked her, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.20": "“… How can the nun Thullanandā, knowing that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell others? ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.21": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.22": "And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule thus: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.23^a": "Final ruling ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:1.23": "‘If a nun knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, but she neither confronts her herself nor tells others, and afterwards—whether that nun remains or has died or has been expelled or has converted—she says, “Venerables, although I previously knew that this nun was of such-and-such kind, I thought, ‘I will neither confront her myself nor tell others,’” she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on those who conceal offenses.’” ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.1": "A: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.2": "whoever … ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.3": "Nun: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.4": "… The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.5": "Knows: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.6": "she knows by herself or others have told her or she has told her. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.7": "Has committed an offense entailing expulsion: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.8": "she has committed any one of the eight offenses entailing expulsion. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.9": "She neither confronts her herself: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.10": "she does not herself accuse her. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.11": "Nor tells others: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.12": "she does not tell other nuns. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.13": "Whether that nun remains or has died: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.14": "Remains: what is meant is that she remains as a nun. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.15": "Has died: what is meant is that she has passed away. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.16": "Has been expelled: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.17": "she has either disrobed herself or been expelled by others. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.18": "Has converted: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.19": "what is meant is that she has joined the ascetics of another sect. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.20": "Afterwards […] she says, “Venerables, although I previously knew that this nun was of such-and-such kind, I thought, ‘I will neither confront her myself’”: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.21": "“I won’t accuse her myself.” ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.22": "“Nor tell others”: ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.25": "this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.26": "Is expelled: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.27": "just as a fallen, withered leaf is incapable of becoming green again, so a nun who knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, but who thinks, “I will neither confront her myself nor tell others,” by the mere fact of giving up her duty, is not an ascetic, not a daughter of the Sakyan—therefore it is said “she is expelled”. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.28": "Excluded from the community: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.29": "Community: common legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.1.30": "She does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.1^a": "Non-offenses ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.1": "There is no offense: ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.2": "if she does not tell because she thinks there will be quarrels or disputes in the Sangha; ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.3": "if she does not tell because she thinks there will be a fracture or schism in the Sangha; ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.4": "if she does not tell because she thinks the person she is telling about is cruel and harsh and that she might become a danger to life or to the living of the spiritual life; ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.5": "if she does not tell because she does not see any suitable nuns; ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.6": "if she does not tell, but not because she wants to conceal; ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.7": "if she does not tell because she thinks the other person will be known through her own actions; ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6:2.2.8": "if she is insane; ",
