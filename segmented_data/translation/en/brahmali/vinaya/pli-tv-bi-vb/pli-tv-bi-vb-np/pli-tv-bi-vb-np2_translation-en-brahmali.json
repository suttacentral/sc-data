  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.2": "At that time, after completing the rains residence in a village monastery, a number of nuns were traveling to Sāvatthī. They were perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.3": "Some lay followers who saw them thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.4": "“These nuns are perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes; they must’ve been robbed,” and they gave out-of-season robe-cloth to the Sangha of nuns. ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.5": "Because they had done the robe-making ceremony, the nun Thullanandā ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.6": "determined it as in-season robe-cloth, and then shared it out. ",

  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.17": "Those nuns then told the monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bi-vb-np2:1.18": "who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha assembled and questioned the monks: ",
