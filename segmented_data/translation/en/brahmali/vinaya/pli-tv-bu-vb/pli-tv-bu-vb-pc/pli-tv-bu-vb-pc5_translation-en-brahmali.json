  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Āḷavī at the Aggāḷava Shrine. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.2": "At that time the lay followers were going to the monastery to listen to the Teaching. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.3": "When the instruction was over, the senior monks went to their own dwellings, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.4": "but the newly ordained monks went to sleep right there in the assembly hall together with the lay followers—absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.5": "The lay followers complained and criticized them, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.6": "“How can the venerables go to sleep absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.7": "The monks heard the complaints of those lay followers, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.8": "and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.9": "“How can those monks sleep in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordained?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.10": "After rebuking those newly ordained monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha assembled and questioned the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.11": "“Is it true, monks, that monks do this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.12": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.15": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:1.18": "In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.1": "After staying at Āḷavī for as long as he wanted, the Buddha set out wandering toward Kosambī. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.2": "When he eventually arrived at Kosambī, he stayed at the Badarikā Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.3": "Just then the monks said to Venerable Rāhula, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.4": "“Rāhula, the Buddha has laid down a training rule that we can’t sleep in the same sleeping place as a person who’s not fully ordained. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.5": "Please find another sleeping place.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.6": "Since Rāhula was not able to get a sleeping place, he lay down to sleep in the restroom. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.7": "Then, after rising early in the morning, the Buddha went to the restroom, where he cleared his throat. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.8": "Rāhula, too, cleared his throat. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.9": "“Who’s there?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.10": "“It’s me, Sir, Rāhula.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.11": "“Why are you sitting here, Rāhula?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.12": "Rāhula told the Buddha what had happened. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.13": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc5:2.14": "“Monks, I allow you to sleep in the same sleeping place as a person who isn’t fully ordained for two or three nights. ",
