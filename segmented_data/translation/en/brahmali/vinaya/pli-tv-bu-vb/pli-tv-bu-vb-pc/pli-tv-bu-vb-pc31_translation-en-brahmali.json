  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.1": "At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.2": "At that time a certain association was preparing an alms-meal at a public guest house not far from Sāvatthī. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.3": "Then, after robing up one morning, the monks from the group of six took their bowl and robe and entered Sāvatthī for alms. Not getting anything, they went to that public guest house. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.4": "And because it was long since they had been there, people served them respectfully. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.5": "For a second and third day those monks did the same thing. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.6": "Then they thought, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.7": "“What’s the point of returning to the monastery? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.8": "Tomorrow we’ll just have to come back here.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.9": "And so they stayed on and on right there, eating alms at the guest house. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.10": "And the ascetics of other sects left. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.11": "People then complained and criticized them, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.12": "“How can these Sakyan ascetics stay on and on, eating alms at the guest house? ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.13": "We don’t prepare the alms-food just for them; ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.14": "we prepare it for everyone.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.15": "The monks heard the complaints of those people, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.16": "and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.17": "“How can the monks from the group of six stay on and on, eating alms at a public guest house?” … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.18": "“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.19": "“It’s true, Sir.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.20": "The Buddha rebuked them, ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.22": "This won’t give rise to confidence in those without it … ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.23": "And, monks, this training rule should be recited thus: ",

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.24": "‘If a monk eats more than one alms-meal at a public guest house, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:1.25": "In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.1^a": "Second sub-story ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.1": "Soon afterwards Venerable Sāriputta was traveling in the Kosalan country toward Sāvatthī when he came to a public guest house. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.2": "Because it was long since he had been there, people served him respectfully. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.3": "After he had eaten, Sāriputta became severely ill, and he was not able to leave that guest house. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.4": "On the second day, too, those people said to him, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.5": "“Eat, Venerable.” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.6": "But since he knew that ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.7": "the Buddha had prohibited eating alms at a public guest house after staying on and on, and because he was afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.8": "As a consequence he missed his meal. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.9": "When he arrived at Sāvatthī, he told the monks what had happened, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.10": "and they in turn told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.11": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.12": "“Monks, I allow a sick monk to stay on at a public guest house and eat alms there. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pc31:2.13": "” And so, monks, this training rule should be recited thus: ",
