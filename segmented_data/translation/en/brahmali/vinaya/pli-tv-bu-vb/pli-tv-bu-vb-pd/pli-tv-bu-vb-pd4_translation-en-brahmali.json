  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.3": "The Sakyan women wished to prepare a meal for monks in wilderness dwellings, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.4": "but the slaves heard about this ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.6": "and they infested the path. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.7": "When the Sakyan women took various kinds of nice food and set out for a wilderness dwelling, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.8": "the slaves emerged, and they robbed and raped those Sakyan women. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.9": "The Sakyan men then came out and got hold of those thieves together with their loot. They then complained and criticized the monks, ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.10": "“How can they not announce that there are bandits staying in the monastery?” ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.11": "The monks heard the complaints of the Sakyans ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.12": "and they told the Buddha. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.13": "Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:1.14": "“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions in the present life, for avoiding corruptions in future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the continuation of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.

  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:2.3": "and they invited that monk to eat. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:2.6": "But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited the eating of staple or non-staple food after personally receiving it at a wilderness dwelling, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept it. And not being able to walk for alms, he missed his meal. ",
  "pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4:2.7": "That monk then told the monks what had happened, ",
